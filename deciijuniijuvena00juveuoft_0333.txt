SATIRA XII.

Caelati biberat quo callidus emptor Olynthi.
Sed quis nunc alius qua mundi parte, quis audet
Argento praeferre caput rebusque salutem?

Non propter vitam faciunt patrimonia quidam,

50

Sed vitio caeci propter patrimonia vivunt.
J actatur rerum utilium pars maxima; scd nce

Damna levant.

Tunc adversis urgentibus illuc

Decidit ut malum ferro summitteret ς hac re

Graeciae quam victor '' (vii. 2. 10. Extera).
This letter to his son is given by Cicero
de Off. ii. 15. Olynthus in Chalcidice was
besieged by Philip Rc. 348, and taken
through the treachery of two of the inhabit-
ants, Lasthenes and Euthycrates, whose
services Philip bought. The city was de-
stmyed and the inhabitants sold. All the
cities in Chalcidice he gained at the same
time and in the same way. He acted uui·
versally on the principle laid down for him
by the oracle, ἆρ’γυρέαις λόγχῃσι μάχου καὶ
πάντα κρατήσεις. Philip had the reputatiou
of being a hard drinker: Pliny says he
slept with a gold cup under his pillow
(Η. N. xxxiii. 3).

48. Sed quis nunc alius qua] There is
a mock seriousness about all this description
of Catullus' sacrifice of his goods to save
his life. The man must have been in a
terrible fright, and went on throwing his
things away rccklessly, it would seem, in
the hope of making the ship lighter or pro-
pitiating the elements. There is some
humour therefore in the apparent earnest-
naes with which he asks “ Who else in
these days and where, who, I say, has the
boldness to prefer his life to his money ?'’
τίς ποῦς “Nay, take my life and all—you
take my life when you do take the means
whereby Ι live,''says Shylock. The two next
verses Heinrich says contain good sense,
but in this place are very insipid. He and
Jahn agree with Bentley, who on Hor. A. P.
387 pronounces them spurious. Bentley
asks, “quorsum enim hic Quidam, quum
jam dixerat ne unum quidem ulla mundi
parte vitam patrimonio praeferre ¹? Quale
autem illud facere patrimonia ! quae sca·
bies locutionis ! Quam alienum et panno-
sum illud Vitio caeci ! quod eo tantum
assuitur ut versiculi cento sarciatur—sole-
bant olim sententiosa hujusmodi in mar-
gine allini quae postea in contextum irrep-
serunt.'’ We may give the verses up with-
out loss. The Scholiast however has them
and all the MSS.

52. Jaetatwr rerum utilium] ‘ Res utiles’

are all kinds of things used by man, in-
cluding food. They arc opposed to orna-
mental things. But all the losses do not
lighten the ship enough. Ruperti thinks
‘juvant' is the proper word. Heinecke
quotes against him virgil (Aen. i. 145,
146), “levat ipse tridcnti3 Et vastas aperit
syrteS, et temperat aequor.’' But there
the ship was aground. ‘ Levant' is the
right word however. ‘Nec ’ is ‘ not even.'
(xi. 132.)

54. Decidit ut malum] This is the read-
ing of most MSS. P. has ‘recidit’ and
so has the Scholiast. The first syllable
of that word is made long by Lucretius,
PropertiuS, and Ovid (see Forcellini). Ru-
perti's rule (Var. Lect.) that in verbs
compoundcd with ‘re,’ that syllable is
common, provided the simple verbs begin
with a consonant, is not true. Here ‘de-
dicit' is probably the right word, in the
sense in which the Greeks commonly nse
καταβαίνειν, ‘he comes (or matters come)
to this, that he must apply the axe to
the mast-¹ So Suetonius says of Claudius,
“ad eas rei familiaris angustias decidit‚’'
and Pliny, Epp. iv. 11, “nunc eo decidit
nt exul de senatore, rhetor de oratore
fieret” (Heinecke‚ p. 101). ‘Recidit'
[Ribbeck] might however be admitted
[or ‘reccidit,’ Jahn], and if so, it would
be like ‘res redit’ so common in Terence,
as “in eum jam res rediit locum Ut sit
necesse’' (Heaut. ii. 3.118). ‘ Hac re'
is the reading of only one MS„ which
Ruperti praises highly, and attributes to
the twelfth century. This reading is al-
most too good to be true on such slender
authority. The other MSS. as well as
the Scholiast have ‘ac se' or ‘at se?
[Jahn and Ribbeck have ‘ac se.’] 1
have however followed Heinrich in a
doubtful reading. The sense then is “by
this act he got out of the difficulty: but
the extreme of danger must it be when
we apply means of relief which must take
away part of the ship.'' ‘Explicat’ is
used as Horace uses it in C. iv. 9. 44, n. ε
