xxviii INTRODUCTION.

The Grammarian says he rcverenced as a father Servilius Nonianus,
who was probably a friend of his own father. IIis praenomen was Marcus. .
He was consul the year after Persius was born, and died two years before
him. IIe was distinguished as a public speaker aud as an historian, and
likewise for the purity of his life, as Tacitus says ⁷. The Scholiast says
that Persius’ honest friend, Macrinus (Plotius, the Scholiast calls him),
to whom the second Satire is addi-essed, lived with Servilius, and so
perhaps the intimacy between these friends began.

Among his fellow-pupils was M. Annaeus Lucanus, author of the
Pharsalia, a young man of great abilitieS, whose career, like that of
Persius, was short. He was about the same age as Persius when they
were studying together, and survived him not more than three years.
He was put to death for joining the conspiracy of Piso against Nero,
ΑΛ). 65 ⁸. Jahn takes pains to show that there could be no great sym-
pathy between the impetuous Spaniard and the quiet modest Persius3
but very opposite characters are drawn into intimacy by circumstances.
and by particular points of mutual attraction. Lucanus praised the
poetry of Persius with every appearance of sincerity, and that would be
a virtue in his or any author's eyes.

It was, no doubt, through Cornutus or Lucanus that Persius became
acquainted with another of the Annaei, M. Seneca, uncle of Lucanus.
This acquaintance did not begin so soon as the others, and Persius was
old enough to form a deliberate judgment of Seneca’s character, and
according to the Grammarian it was not favourable to him. That
Seneca’s connexion with Nero led him into acts at vai-iance with his
professed principles, is certain, and there is no reason to suppose
that Persius entertained a warm affection for a man forty years older
than himself, associated, with or without his own free will, with the
crime of a matrichle, and whose enormous wealth was chiefly accu-
mulated through the favour of a tyrant whom Persius despised and
abhorred. But the remark of the Grammarian seems to be that of
one who had himself adopted the exaggerated opinion against Seneca,
which the jealousy of his rivals and enemies gave rise to during his
life ⁹.

Of the young men whom the Grammarian describes in such high termS,
Claudius Agathemerus and Petronius Aristocrates, nothing is known.

⁷ Anu. xiv. 19.

8 See note on J uv. vii. 7 9. The age usually assigned to Lucanus at his death, twenty-
six, can hardly be right. The Grammariau says he was of the same age as Persius, and
he could not have been much younger, or less than thirty, in ΑΛ). 65. [The Gramma-
rian's words are ‘ aequaevum auditorem‚’ which perhaps need not be taken very strictly.
The evidence for Lucan's age at the time of his death is very small.]

⁹ The character of the younger Seneca, as a man anda writer, is temperately reviewed
in Mr. Long's notice of him in the Dictionary of Biography.
