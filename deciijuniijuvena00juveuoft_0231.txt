SATI RA Vl I.

Et veras agitant lites raptore relicto ;
Fusa venena silent, malus ingratusque maritus,

Et quaejam veteres sanant mortaria caecos.

Ergo sibi dabit ipse rudem si nostra movebunt
Consilia, et vitae diversum iter ingredietur,
Ad pugnam qui rhetorica deseendit ab umbra„
Summula ne pereat qua vilis tessera venit

Frumenti: quippe haec merces lautissima.

dozen or more tenc-hers besides. This
means plenty inore. ‘ sophista ’ was a name
commonly given to the rhetoric-lans and
granimarians of this time, as it had been
originally to all who were masters of their
nrt, and particularly to the rhetorical and
other teat-hers who gained so much ascend-
ancy over the younger Athenians in the
fisth century n-c. The derivation of the
word (from σοφίζεσθαι, to practise σοφία)
is enough to show that its original sense was
good. Herodotus applies it to solon (i. 29)
and to Pythagoras (iv. 95). Σοφιστὴς came
to be used in a bad sense through the abuse
of science by the later profess-ors, who were
despised for taking money from their
scholars. It then was used to mean not
only a professor but a trader in wisdom,
and from that a mere prctender : ἐστὶ γὰρ
ἡ σοφιστικὴ φαινομένη σοφία οὖσα δ’ οὔ,
καὶ ὁ σοφιστὴς χρηματιστὴς ἀπὸ φαινο-
μένης σοφίας ἀλλ’ οὐκ οὔσης (Aristot.
Soph. Elench. c. 1). From this Cicero took
his definition (Ac-adem. Prior. ii. 23) ε
“At quis est hic? num Sophistes? sic
enim appellabantur ii qui ostentationis aut
quaestus causa philosophabantur.'’ And
yet he calls Theophrastus, Aristotle, Xeno-
phon, and Plato ‘sophistae’ (Orat. 19).
The men Juvenal refers to would be classed
with the man Gellius speaks of (xvii. 5):
“rhetoricus quidam sophista utriusque
linguae callens, haud sane ignobilis ex
illis acutulis ct minutis doctoribus qui
τεχνικοὶ appellantur, atque in disserendo
tamen non impiger.'' ‘Antisophistae' was
a word used for disputants in the rhetorical
schools. See Suet. vit. Tib. c. 11 : “ moto
inter antisophistas graviore jurgio.'’ Also
de Ill. Gram. c. 9, where 110 says Orbilius,
Horace's fiery schoolmaster, was “naturae
acerbae in antisophistas.”

168. Et veras agitant lites] ‚He means
they give up teaching and go and praetise
in the courts. He expresses this by saying
they leave behind them ravishers and poi-
sonings and bad husbands and drugs to
cure blind old men. The history of Medea

furnished topies for discussion and declama-
tion ; herc the bad husband may be Jason,
and the blind old man Pelias, for whose story
see Ovid, Met. vii. 297. sqq. Heinrich
follows Britannicus, Grangneus, and other
old connnentators in supposing these to be
‘ controversiae scholasticae? ‘ causac fletae,’
fictitious legal cases such as are found in
the Dcclamations attributed to Quintilian.
‘Venenum cfl'usum’ is the theme of De-
clain. xvii. I incline to take it the other
way, as Ruperti does.
caecos’ see S. viii. 49, n.

171. Erffo sibi dabit ipse rudem] As
to ‘rudem' see vi. 113. Horace has the
same way of speaking, Epp. i. 1. 2;

“ Spectatum satis et donatum jain rude
quaeris,
Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere
ludo‚''

where it is explained that ‘rudis’ was a
wootlcn sword or cudgel with which a gla-
diator was presented when 110 got his dis·
charge. He says the rhetoricians leave
their schools and betake themselves to the
eourts that they may make a trifle, which
is the most they will get. But 110 advises
them to change their line altogether, and
follow some other. .‘ Pugnam ’ is the same
as ‘veras lites' above (v. 168). ‘ Umbra '
is here a school. Horace uses it for a bar-
ber's shop (“ vacua tonsoris in umbra,''
Epp. i. 7. 50), and it is used for other pri-
vate dwellings. (Sec Forcellini.) Ruperti
(on v. 8) says it is “ a vita obscura et scho-
lastica quae formae et celebritatis expers
est,'’ which is quite wrong. Heinrich
thinks ‘ descendit ’ should be ‘ descendat‚'
and that the sense is ‘ita ut descendat ;’
as below (v. 178) ‘in qna gestetur dominus ’
means that the master may have a place to
ride in. The cases are not the same, and
I (10 not think Heinrich is right.

174. vili-9 tessera] ‘Tesserae frumen-
tariae ' were tickets given to the poor on
the public account, in exchange for which
they got a small quantity of corn. This
