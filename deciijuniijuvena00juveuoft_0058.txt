8 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid referam quanta siccum jecur ardeat ira,

Quum populum gregibus comitum premit hic spoliator
Pupilli prostantis, ct hic damnatus inani

Judicio (quid enim salvis infamia nummis?)

Exsul ab octava issarius bibit et fruitur dis

Iratis3 at tu, victrix provincia, ploras.

Haec ego non credam Venusina digna lucerna?

Claudius was born in that city, lst of Au-
gust, uc. 10. (Suet. vit. Claudii, c. 2.).
Dion Cassius rclates that gamcs were cele-
brated there in the life-time of Augustus
(l. 216. c. 50). If so, it was reserved for Ca-
ligula to establish a rhetorical contest in
Greek and Latin, in which those who, in
the Emperor's judginent, had acquitted
themselves worst, (¹⁸v ii qui maxime displi-
cuissent'’) were obliged to lick out what
they had written with their tongue, or to be
flogged, or plunged in the nearest stream.
To this two epigrams in the Anthologia,
quoted by Scaliger on the above passage of
Suetonius, are said by him to relate.

τοῦ σοῦ ’γὰρ πάσχω νεκροῦ χάριν οἷα

πάθοιεν
οἵ καταλείξαντες βιβλία καὶ καλάμους.
Lib. ii. 40. 7.
οὐχ ὅτι τὸν κάλαμον λείχεις διὰ τοῦτό σε
μισω,
ἀλλ’ ὅτι τοῦτο ποιεῖς καὶ δίχα τοῦ καλά-
μου. Ib. 12. 8.

Juvenal seems to refer to the competitors on
these occasions who had reason to be afraid
their speeches might meet with disapproba-
tion, and who trembled for the couse-
quences.

46. populum ι(γι-05]]’Ζ1η1 comitum premit]
P. and all the older and more trustworthy
MSS. have the indicative meod ε several of
the later have ‘premat ;’ and Heinrich
adopts it. Ruperti and Jahn have ‘ premit‚'
in reliance on the MSS. and the indicatives
that follow 3 and that mood is, I believe,
the right one. As to ‘ pupilluS,' see Diet.
Aut„ Art. ‘ Tutor ;' and Hor. Epp. i. 1.
21, 11. This ‘ tutor' went out to the forum
orto the walks, attendcd, ⁴ (leductus’ (Hor.
S. i. 9. 59), by crowds of parasites, sup-
ported hy the fortune of his ‘ pupilluS‚' who
was left to starve or to support himself by
the vilest means. ‘Comites' is the word
used belom ver. 119. Ruperti thinks ‘pu-
pillae’ must be the proper word, but does
not adopt it. It would be less offensive ;
but that is not much to the purpose.

47. et· hic damnatus inani Judicio] We
have the private thief and the public brought

together. Marius Priscus, proconsul of
Africa, was convicted (11.1). 100) of ‘ repe-
t1111(lac‚’ and banished from Italy. Marius
was compelled to refund a part of his bad
gains, and retired with the remainder to live
comfortaffly, though not at home. The
offence of ‘ repetundae: which was that of
a magistrate getting money by illegal means
from the provincials under 1115 govermnent,
was punished with different pcnalties at dif-
ferent times. The latest ‘lex’ on the subject
was the ‘ lex Julia‚’ passed in the dictator-
ship of C. Julius Caesar, which abolished the
punishment of exile; but it appears to have
been revived under the empire. The re-
funding of the money proved to have been
received was always part of the penalty;
and in this instance it appears that 700
sestertia (about 5500l. sterling) were paid
by Marius into the treasury. An interesting
account of the whole affair is given by the
younger Pliny, who, with C. Cornelius
Tacitus, the historian, acted for the pro-
vineials (Epp. ii. 11). See Long’s Excursus
on Cic. iu Verr. on ‘ Repetundae,' and
Diet. Ant. under the same head; and also
the article ⁴ Infamia) ‘ Ab octava bibit '
means that *he sat down to dinner earlier
than usual ς the ninth hom· in summer, and
tenth in winter, being those at which in-
dustrious persons generally dined (Hor. C.
1. 1. 20, 11.). ‘ Fruitur dis iratis‚' he enjoys
the anger of the gods: that is, 110 makes
himself comfortable under his punishment.

50. victrix provincia,] Grangaeus sup-
poses this to be a play upon the words.
Even if it were (which is not likely), it would
be only from the similarity of sound, and
would not support Festus’ derivation of
‘provincia’ from ‘ vincere? Provincia is a
shortened forn] of ‘ providentia: and “ pro-
perly designated the particular functione of
a magistrate.” See Long’s note on Cic.
in Verr. ii. 2. 1. ‘ Vincere ' is the legal word
for succeeding in a cause. On ‘ploras'
Grangaeus adds, “ tibi enim fuit victoria
Cadmea,in qua jocatur victus, plorat victor.”

51. Venusina digna lucerna ?] Horace
and Juvenal had not much in common ; but
Horace seems to have been looked upon by
