Nee tibi parcetur misero, trepidumque magistrum
In cavea magno fremitu leo tollet alumnus.
Nota mathematicis genesis tua ε sed grave tardas

Exspectare colus.

Jam torquet juvenem long-a et cervina senectus.
Ocius Archigenen quaere atque eme quod Mithridates
Composuit, si vis aliam decerpere ficum

Atque alias tractare rosas. Medicamen habendum est

Sorbere ante cibum quod debeat et pater et rex.

taken up again here, and ‘ergo’ carries
the mind back over the digression (x. 54).
It doae not mean “since yourlove of money
is so ardent, 238 ” (May-or).

246. trepidumque orzayistrzoeon] “ The
lion you have reared will loudly rour and
kill his trembling keeper in his cagc.”
What follows explains this. ‘Que' is
sometimes used after negative sentences
where an adversative particle might be
expected. ‘Nec tibi' is ‘not even you,'
as above, v. 127. In the reign of Domitian
a lion killed its keeper, and Martial made
it an occasion for flattering the emperor
as usual (de Spect. x.):

“Laeserat ingrato leo perfidus ore magis-
trum,
Ausus tam notas contemerare manus
Sed dignas tanto persolvit crimine poe-
nas,
Et qui non tulerat verbera tela tulit.
Quos decet esse hominum tali sub prin-
cipe mores,
Qui jubet ingenium mitius esse feris ?’'

248. Nota mathematici-r genesis tua :]
‘⁶ The astrologers have calculated your na-
tivity‚ you may say, and you are destined
to live long. But your son will not wait
till your thread 15 run out: it’s tiresome
to wait upon the tardy distaff: you'll die
before the thread 15 broken off.” See iii.
27, x. 252, xii. 64. As to the astrologers
see notes on S. iii. 42, vi. 553, 565. Mr.
Mayor's explanation, ‘⁴ your son has learnt
from the astrologers your nativity‚” does
not represent the sense or the grammar of
‘ Nota mathematicis genesis tua.’ He has
followed Ruperti. ‘ J am nunc ' is even at
this moment you are in his way. This
makes the matter very messing, and is
a humorous way of bringing it home to the
man. He must almost feel the poison in

tells him to make all haste and go to the
doctor and get an antidote. Mithridates
VI„ king of Pontus, was in the habit of
taking antidotes, and had so fortified his
constitution by their means that when
he wished to poison himself he could
not, and was obliged to get a soldier to
kill him. See vi. 661 : “ Pontica ter vieti
cautus medicamina regis.” Gellius (xvii.
16) sayS‚ 011 the authority of Lenaeus, 0110
of the earliest Roman writers on medicine,
that the blood of Pontic geese formed a
principal ingredient in these antidotes. As
to Archigenes the physician see vi. 236, n.

251. [onya et cervina senectus] As to
the age of stag-s Pliny (Η. N. vii. 48)
refers to a statement of Hesiod in which
he attributes to the raven nine lives of
man, to the stag four times the raven’s,
and to the crow three times the stag's.
To man he gives 96 years ς so the stag, as
Sir Thomas Browne observes, has a life of
3456 years, “a eonceit hard to be made
out’' he adds. Pliny does not give credit
to the computation os Hesiod. Aristotle
(Hist. An. vi. 29) denies the longevity of
the animal, and Browne allows it 36 or
40 yearS, and “thereby it will exceed all
cornigerous animals” (V ulgar Errors
iii. 9).

254. Atque azias tractare rosam] This
represents the spring, as the figs the au-
tumn, “dmn ficus prima calorque Designa-
torem decorat lictoribus atris ’' (Hor. Epp.
1. 7. 5). ‘Atque' is ‘and even‚' so it lias
force, which it has not us Ruperti explains
it, “si vis auctumnum et ver aliud videre,
h. e. vel annum vivere.''

255. et pater et resa] P. has kept the
true reading ‘et' instead of ‘ aut? While
Mithridates was laying plans for the re-
eovery of Pontus, which Cn. Pompeius had
taken from him, a conspiracy was formed

his stomach. To keep up the effect 110 against him by his son and heir Pharnaces.
