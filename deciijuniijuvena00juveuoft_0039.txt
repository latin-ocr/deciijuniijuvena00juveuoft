considered thc best. Ι have not made the collation luy-clf, bnt Ι have
examined it and Ι hope it is sufficient. This collation docs not show
the differences in orthography, where the words arc the sanic, nor tlw
different-es in punctuation except in smne cases where these ‹litl'crvnccs
effect the sense. I have examincd all thc¹ passages in which the-c two
texts differ, and Ι find a great many in which Macleane’s tcxt is bcttcr
than that of Jahn, wlio has introduced some bad readings. Ι have
observed a few passages in which Ι should prefer ‚Jalm's text, bnt on
the whole Ι think the Englisliman has shown more good sense and
judgment than the German.

Ι have added in the notes nearly all the variations of Ribbeck's text.
Many of Ribbeek’s variations are the same as Jah11’s,but he has some of
his own, and most of them seem to me bad. Some of his transpositions
improve the text, bnt most of them do not. He has handled the sixth
Satire so freely as to the transposition and omission of verses, that
it would require much time and study to pass a just judgment on his
labour3 bnt it will be generally allowed that the matter of this Satire,
as it stands in the common textS, is not well arranged.

Ι have made many small corrections in Mr. Macleane's notes, where
there was some slight error or mis-statement, but I have omitted nothing
and altered nothing which Ι believe the editor would not have omitted
οι· corrected. He would probably have changed his opinion on some
points, and would both have omitted and altered much more than I have
done, for my business was not to edit ,Juvenal and Persius, but to pre-
serve the work of my friend. The references in this volume are very
numerous, and the causes of errors in the figures of such references are
various. Ι have corrected a great many wrong references, and though
I cannot hope that Ι have corrected all, Ι believe that the errors which
remain are not many. In the references to the MSS. Ι have discovered
a few slight errors since this book was printed, but they are not such as
to require any particular notice. I have added a little in the notes here
and there, where I thought it necessary. All the additions which
I have made are marked thus [ ].

Ribbeck has published an essay on Juvenal (“ Der Echte und der Unechte
Juvenal, Berlin,'' 1865), which is to some extent a justificatior] of his
text. After briefly stating how much we learn from Juvenal of Roman
manners from the time of Tiberius to Trajan and Hadrian, he adds that
this knowledge is got exclusively from the first nine Satires and the
eleventh3 that the tenth, twelfth, thirteenth‚ fourteenth, and fifteenth
supply scarcely any information of the kind. They contain mere allu-
sions to well-known names and personS, or introduce characters of
various kinds, which are not marked hy any individuality. The genuine
Juvenal is a follower of Lucilius, and though he did not lash his con-
