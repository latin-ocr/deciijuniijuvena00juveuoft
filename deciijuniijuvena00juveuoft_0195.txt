SATI RA VI.

Turba tacet : nec causidicus nce praeco loquatur,

Altera nec mulier : verborum tanta cadit vis,

440

Tot pariter pelves, tot tintinnabula dicas

Pulsari.

J am nemo tubas, nemo acra fatiget:

Una laboranti poterit succurrere lunae.
Imponit tinem sapiens ct rebus honestis :

Nam quae docta nimis eupit et facunda videri,

445

Crure tenus medio tunicas succingere debet,
Caedere Silvano porcum, quadrante lavari.
Non habeat matrona tibi quae juncta recumbit:

for scales, of which the Romans commonly
used the libra, which is here referred to, a
balance with two disheS, and the statera or
steel-yard. ⁸ Grammatici ¹ was the name of
all teachers of languages, as ‘ rhetores ¹ was
ofteaehers of rhetoric, both ordinary parts
of a Roman's education aster as well as
during his school—days. See Hor. Epp. i.
19. 40, n.

439. nec causidicus, nec praeeo] As to
the ‘causidici,'see note on S. i. 32. These
people are put with the criers because like
them they have good lnngs, but they give

clatter of a nietal basin or a bell. [Jahn
and Ribbeck have ‘ loquetur.']

442. Jam nemo tabem] “No one need
now blow trumpets and beat cymbals to
help the moon in her trouble and drown
the voices of the witches.'' The super—
stitious connected with eclipses are as pre-
valent in one form or other now as ever.
It seems the ignorant supposed that the
witches char-med the moon away, and that
noise would drown their incantations. How
possible such nonsense may be, any one
may convince himself by going among the
Hindoos. He may see multitudes pros-
trating themselves on the sea-shore, and
crying and beating drums, while the moon
is retiring under the earth's shadow, the
vulgar notion being that a great snake is
swallowing her.

444. Impom't finem sapiens] 1 do not
see any difficulty in these words. Gifl'ord
calls it a difficult line, and translates it,
'‘ She lectures too on Ethics, and declaims
on the chief Good‚'’ which 110 says “is in
oonformity to the opinion of some of the
best commentators.’' As the words stand
the sense is plainly that however good
knowledge may be for women, all good
things have their limits, and a woman

ought not to be too learned; for she who
seeks to be so had better come out as a
man at once. All that follows illustrates
this excess. whether Juvenal wrote the
line or not is another question. Heinrich
thinks he did not, but that the monks did.
Heinrich also thinks vv. 445—447 should
come after 456. [Ribbeck places v. 444
aud the three following verses after v. 456,
and this is a better place for them.] ‘Nam'
must have some meaning. If v. 444 is
spurious, as I 3111 inclined to think it is, it
may have been substituted for some other.
Vl'hether this be so or not ‘ nam ' may be
used, as it sometimes is, only to carry on
the sense (see note 011 v. 185, above).

446. Crure tenus medio] As the Scho-
liast says, “ hoc est, accipere debet virilem
habitum et cingi ut vir.” As to the length
of the tunic, see note on Hor. S. i. 2. 25,
“ Maltinus tunicis demissis ambulat.” The
Scholiast says on the next line that women
might not sacrifice to Silvanus. They would
have no occasion to do so. He was the
sarmer’s god, and all kinds of country pro-
auctions were offered. to him (see note on
Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 143, “ Tellurem porco, Sil-
vanum lacte piabant”). As to ‘quadrante
lavari ' see S. ii. 152, n.‚ “nisi qui nondum
aere 1avantur.”

448. Non habeat matrona] As to ‘non’
for‘ne,' see Key's Lat. Gr. ξ 14Ο2; and
for several examples 111 Horace, see note on
C. i. 13. 13, “ Non si me satis audias Sper-es
perpetuu1n‚'’ and on S. ii. 5. 89, ‘¹ Neu
desis operae neve immoderatus abundes?
and ‘non etiam sileas: v. 91. Euripides
(HippolytuS, v. 640) says,

σοφὴν δὲ μισῶ· μὴ ’γὰρ ἔν ’γ’ ἐμοῖς δόμοις
εἵη φρονοῦσα πλεῖον ἢ ’γυναῖκα χρῆν
τὸ γὰρ πανοῦργον μᾶλλον ἐντίκτει Κύ-
ἐν 71-ῗὲ σοφαΐσι.
