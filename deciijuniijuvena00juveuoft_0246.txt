D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Custodes aquilas, armis industrius : at tu
Nil nisi Cecropides truncoque simillimus Hermae.
Nullo quippe alio vincis discrimine quam quod

Illi marmoreum caput cst, tua vivit imago.

Dic mihi, Teucrorum proles, animalia muta

Quis generosa putet nisi fortia? nempe volucrem
Sic laudamus equum facili cui plurima palma
Fervet et exsultat rauco victoria Circo.

Nobilis hic, quoeunque venit de gramine, cujus

Clara fuga. ante alios et primus in aequore pulvis :
Sed venale pecus Corythae posteritas et

Hirpini si rara jugo Victoria sedit.

Nil ibi majorum respectus, gratia nulla

Umbrarum: dominos pretiis mutare jubentur

and does nothing. ‘ J uvenis ⁹ is a man of
fighting age, and here it is used empha-
tically for a brave soldier. The Persians
have the same word for a soldier and a
youth, and it has a close resemblance to

‘juvenis‚' d} > (juwan). The state of

the East required the presence of a standing
army to keep down rebellion in Armenia,
which was reduced to a Roman province by
Trajan, and to eheck the Parthiam. The
Batavi, who inhabited the country between
the Mosa (Maas) and the Rhine from the
junction of those rivers by the Vahalis
(Vt'aal) to the sea, were a brave people, and
were never strictly tributary to the Romans.
In the years ΑΛ). 69, 70 they carried 011 11
sharp struggle for independence under a
native chief Civilis. They were at last
put down (Tac. Hist. iv. v.). The satire,
therefore, was written after this war.
‘Aquilas ³ is put for the army left after the
outbreak to prevent a recurrence of it.
53. truncoque simillimus Hermae]
This seems to have been proverbial. ‘ Her-
mae ’ were busts ; properly but not neces-
sarily of Hermes or Mercurius, which, like
the Greeks, the Romans used to ornament
gardens, to mark boundaries, and for other
purposes. ‘ Trunco ' only means that it had
no legs. It ended in a square column.
[Ribbeck omits vv. 54, 55, as poor stuff,
and not like the style of Juvenal, for if
the satirist had intended to mark empha-
tically the small difference between marble
and a living blockhead, we should find in-
stead of ‘ tua vivit imago ³ something· more
cutting and contemptuous. Many persons
may think with Ribbeck that these two

65

verses are superfluous and weak; but
whether we can certainly conclude that
they are not Juvenal's because we don’t
like them is a matter worth the considera-
tion of those who aspire to be masters of
the art critical.]

56. Teucrorum prolesn] See note on
i. 100, ¹ Ipsos Troiugenas? As to ‘gene-
rosa ³ see above, v. 30. ‘ Sic' is ‘on these
conditions‚' and ‘ cui ' is equivalent to ‘ si
illi ³ or ¹ ut illi? See v. 75.

62. Corythae] This name, though it
appears in nearly all the MSS„ is probably
corrupt. The Scholiast appears to have
had ‘Coryphaei‚' which Heinrich thinks is
right except the gender. Racing animals
were usually mares. He would therefore
read ‘ Coryphaeae? [Ribbeck has ‘ Cory-

haei.’
p 63. ilirpz'ni] This horse is mentioned
by Martia] (iii. 63), who says of a conceited
fellow who thought that he knew every
thing, “ Hirpini veteres qui bene novit
avos ;'' on which Lipsius (Epist. Ceut. iii.
26) observes that the factions (see above,
vii. 114, n.) were particular in preserving

the pedigrees of their best horseS. He
quotes Statius (Silv. v. 2. 21, sqq.) :
“—— Romulei qualis per munera Circi

Cum pulcher visu, titulis generosus avitis
Exspectatur equus, cujus de stemmate
Feliii15iiieritos habet admissura parenteS.'’

Lipsius also gives an inscription which he
says he saw and copied at Rome, by which
it appears that Hirpinus was the son of
Aquilo, a celebrated racer. The stone Lip-
sius describes was a curious one. It had
