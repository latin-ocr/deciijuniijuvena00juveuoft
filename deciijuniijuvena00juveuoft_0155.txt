'hi scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit,
Qui tegitur parma et galea metuensque flagelli

Discit ab hirsuta jaculum torquere capella.

Forsitan impensae Virronem parcere credas.
Hoc agit ut doleas: nam quae comoedia, mimus
Quis melior plorante gula? Ergo omnia fiunt,
Si nescis, ut per lacrimas effundere bilem

Cogaris pressoque diu stridere molari.

Tu tibi liber homo et regis conviva videris :
Captum te nidore suae putat ille culinae,

Nec male conjectat.

Bis ferat, Etruscum puero si contigit aurum

Vel nodus tantum et signum de paupere loro?
Spes bene coenandi vos decipit.

Semesum leporem atque aliquid de clunibus apri:
Ad nos jam veniet minor altilis.” Inde parato
Intactoque omnes et stricto pane tacetis.

153. quod in aggere radia] There are
the following scholia on this pawage. “ Qui
tegitur parma .· tir0.¹’ “ Metuensque fla-
gelli .· quale simia manducat.'' “ Discit ab
hirsuta .- a sene magistro.'’ “ Capella:
ΞοῗξιειξξείξοιῖἓᾳυεᾷὶὶῗηῗιῖἳζηῒῒθτᾞὲροξέεἳέΞ
poses Juvenal to mean an ape dressed up
and taught §by some idle soldiers to throw
darts from the back of a goat. Τὴθ other
scholia apply to recruits learning their drill
from a drillmaster (campidoctor), called
‘capella’ by way of ridicule. The first of
these two is the sense of the passage, I be-
lieve, and so most of the commentators take
it. 'rbere is no weight in Mr. Mayor’s ob-
jection that ‘ ab ' should be ‘ ex? ‘Aggere’
is the rampart of Servius Tullius in the
Esquiliae, the eastern quarter of the city.
(Hor. S. i. 8. 15.) The Scholiast on S. x.
95, ‘et castra domestica: says that the
Praetorian troops were quartered by this
‘aggen’ which circumstance explains xvi.
26 x “ molem aggeris ultra Ut veniat.”
The same ‘agger ' is referred to in S. viii.
43 ι “ Non quae ventoso conducta sub
aggere taexitss’ where the Scholiast gives the
carpe ‚explanation : “ pauper ε iu castris
na us.

157. Hoc agit ut doleas :] ‘ He is bent
upon giving you pain? ‘ Hoc agit ’ has this
meaning commonly. See S. vii. 20, n.

mim uc] The nature of this sort of
play is related in Hor. S. i. 10. 6. He
says, the rich man treats his poor guest in
this scurvy fashion, not to spare expense,
but to enjoy the fun of seeing him grinding
his tceth and weeping with vexation. And
he has some right on his side, for he knows
the man only comes to his table for what
he can get. c

164. Etruscum puero si contigit aurum]
This is the ‘bulla‚’ a small circular plate of
gold which children born free (ingenui) and
rich wore suspended from their necks (see
Cic. in Verr. ii. 1. 58, Long’s notc3 and
Smith’s Dict. Ant„ ‘ Bulla '). This prac-
tice appears to have been of Etruscan origin.
A leather strap with a knot at the end of it
answered the same purpose with the poor.
It was ‘ signum libertatis‚¹ as the Scholiast
says. [Ribbeck omits from the text vv.
161—165, from ‘Tu tibi' to ‘paupere loro?']

166. Eece dabzt jam] “ See, he is going
to give us presently '’ The guests are
supposed to speak, cxpecting something,
though not of the best, to come to them.
And therefore (inde) they sit in silent sus-
pense, with their brcad prepared, uneaten
and grasped in their hand, ready to eat it
with the first windfall that comes. ‘ Strin-
gcre ' is to grasp.
