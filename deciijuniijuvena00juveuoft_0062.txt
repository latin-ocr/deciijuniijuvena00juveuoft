Et quando uberior vitiorum copia? quando
BIajor avaritiae patuit sinus? alea quando

sunt et videntur innominabiles. Silentium
indicit reverentia morum, et verecundus
animus natura dictante illorum declinat
aspectum. Quid multa? Si natura negat
facit indignatio versum.’'

80. C'Iuvienus.] It is impossible to say
who is meant by this name. The Scholiast
throws no light upon it. He only says it
was “ delirus poeta vel iudoetus.’'

81. Er quo Deucalionfl Horace has this
phrase (C. iii. 3. 21): “Ex quo destituit Deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon.” Juvenal says
that the passions of mankind, such as they
have been ever since the flood, are the sub-
jects 1101135 01105011 for his pen. The story
of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and how men and
women sprung up from the stones they
threw behind them, is told at length by
Ovid (Met. i. 260 sqq.). The mountain
on which the vessel lauded is said by Ovid,
and was generally supposed, to be Par-
nassus 3 and the divinity whose oracle Deu-
calion consulted, was Themis ‘ Sortes: for
the answer of an oracle, is taken from the
Italian practice, particularly in the temples
of Fortuna, whose responses were delivered
by lots (Cic. Div. ii. 41. 56), wooden tablets
with different inscriptions shaken out of a
box (‘ sitella,’ ‘ cista,' ‘ urna,³ ‘ arca ’), and
not by word of mouth, as the Greek oracles
were delivered. Virgil has ‘ Lyciae sortes'
twice over (Aen. iv. 316. 377). ‘ Sortes
poscere ’ is an unusual phrase. ‘ Poseere'
is stronger than ‘petere,' which is more
commonly used. ‘Poscere divos' is not
analogous. That is to ask a. favour of the
gods, as “ Quid dedicatum poscit Apollinem
Vates 5³³³ (Hor. C. i. 31. 1.)

83. caluerunt? mollia sturm] This seems
to be taken from Ovid’s description (l. 0.) :
‘⁶ Saxa (quis 1100 credat, nisi sit pro teste

vetustas 12)
Ponere duritiem coepere suumque rigorem,

Mollirique„ mora mollitaque ducere for-
1113111.

· 86. discursum] Foreelliniinterprets this

by “discursationes, 001131115, labores, ad
opes aut dignitates adi1)iscendaS‚” and
quotes Pliny (Epp. viii. 23), ‘⁴ quo discursu
aedilitatem petiit-'³ It seems to signify
generally the distractions of a busy life.
‘ Farrago‚’ which is derived from ‘ far? is
properly a mixture of various grains given
to cattle (Georg. iii. 205). Here it means
a. medley of miscellaneous topics. Persius
uses it in a different sense (v. 77, 500 note).
‘ Libelli' might mean 3 volume of Satires
or this present satire only, as in Horace
(S. i. 10. 92), “I puer atque meo citus
haec subscribe libello‚” where I think ‘li-
bellus ' means the satire; bnt many com-
mentators take it for the book (see [ntr.).
[Ribbeck has ‘ nostri farrago libelli estl]

88. Major avaritiae patuit sinus ?]
‘ Sinus' means the fold of the toga over
the breast within which the purse (cru-
mena) usually hung. Alarge purse would
require a large ‘sinus’ ovid has (Am.
i. 10. 18) : “ Quo pretium condat nou
habet ille sinum.'' So Heinrich takes it.
The old commentators differ. Grangaeus
takes it this way. Britannicus explains it
from the bellying of a sail with a fair wind;
and Owen translates thus,

“ And when did vice with growth so rank
prevail Ρ -.
Or avarice wauton in so fair a gale Ρ ”

Holyday, “ When open lay to avarice a
lai-ger haven Ρ ” Mr. Mayor says, “ When
did the gulf of avarice yawn wider ?'’ eom- ·
paring the passage quoted by Forcellini
from Seneca (Oed. 582), “Subito dehiscit
terra et immenso sinu Laxata patuit.'' I
have no doubt the first explanation is right.

88. alea quando Hos animos ?] “ When
has the gaiubling spirit run so high ?'’
(Owen.) This is a pretty literal translation.
‘⁵ When had gambling such spirit as it has
now (hos animos) ?” Ruperti's explanation
of ‘hos' as “ tot animos sc. cepit, oceu-
pavit ’⁹ (1.0. when did gambling seize upon
so many minds Ρ) is very bad. Heinecke is
