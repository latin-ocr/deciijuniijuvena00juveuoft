1. Ocuras hominum J] Jahn says that
in this verse Persius straightway declares
the argument: he is going to handle. If
that be so, he straightway abandons it.
But it is not so. Hc pretends to have
written some verses (very uulike any thing
he ever wrote probably), and repeats one
of the lines to a friend, and the friend asks
who wiil read such poetry. Persius an-
swers, no one will, or at most but one or
two. His friend thinks this will disgrace
him, and Persius rejects that idea with
contempt. The satire turns upon the
neglect of good poets, and the preference
shown to bad. He thinks what he has
written is good, and does not care for the
world’s judgment. He does not refer to
what he is going to write. The Scholiast
011 v. 2 says that verse is taken from
Lucilius. It has been conjectured that
his remark is meant for v. 1, and Jahn
says, if that be so, it confirms his view. I
do not see how it can be confirmed by any
thing but the fact, and the fact is, that
the first verse does not contain the subject
of this satire or any of the others, and
though dark enough it does not contain
any thing particularly satirical.

3. Vel duo vel nemo] This is a con-
ventional way of saying, ‘scarcely any
one? The Greeks said, ἢ τὶς ἢ οὐδείς.
‘Unus ct alter' is the same sort of ex-
pression. The dialogue is differently dis-
tributed in different editions. The arrange-
ment in the text I have not seen elsewhere,
but it seems the simplest.

4. Ne mihi Polydamas] This is a pro-
verbial way of speaking taken from Homer.
XVhen his parents tried to persuade Hector
to enter the walls and avoid Achilles, he
refused, and reasoned thus with his great
heart :—

ὤ μοι ἐγὼν εἷ μέν κε πύλας καὶ τείχεα
δύω,

Πουλυδάμας μοι πρῶτος ἐλεγχείην ἀνα.-
Θήσει,

and he adds,

αἰδέομαι Τρῶας καὶ Τρωάδας ἑλκεσι-
πέπλους. (Il. xxii. 99, sqq.)

He was afraid of the reproaches of his

friend Polydamas, 1110. 5011 of Panthous,
who had advised all the Trojans to retirc
within their walls (xviii. 254, sqq), and he
was ashamed to meet the men and women
of Troy. The Romans, who were fami-
liar with Homer from boyhood, seem to
have adopted this as a way of speaking.
Cicero writing to Atticus uses it repeatedly
(ii. 53 vii. 15 viii. 16). Aristotle quotes
the same passage to show that shamc
helps courage (Ethic. Eudem. iii. 1). Per-
sius calls his countrymen Trojans, as
Juvenal does (S. i. 100, “ Ipsos Trojuge-
nas'’), and he is generally supposed to
mean a stroke at them when he says
‘Troiades,' Trojan women, as the Ru-
tulian says (Aen. ix. 617), “O vere
Phrygiae, neque 0111111 Phryges.'’ This
piece of satire may have crossed his mind,
but he only uses words which others had
used without such intention.

Of Labeo, the Scholiast says he made a
ridiculous translation of the Iliad and
Odyssey word for word, of which he quotes
as a specimen,

“Crudum manduces Priamum Priamique
pisinnos,”

which is the translation of Il.iv. 35,

‘3¹⁴²3⁹„3B⁶Bp‘59⁰‘3 Πρίαμον Πριάμοιό τε
παι ας. ’

According to the Scholiast, he is the man
named below (50) Accius.
5. Non, si quid turbida Roma Elevet‚]

As to ‘ non' for ‘ ne,' see note on Horace ’

C. i. 13. 13. ‘ Turbida' expresses Horace's
“ Funuun et opes strepitumque Romae ’³
(C. iii. 29. 12). ‘ Elevare ’ is to disparage,
to underrate. (See Foreellini.) ‘Trutina’
is the common γ name of two kinds of
balance in use among the Romans, the
scales (libra) and the steelyard (statera).
Here the former is meant, for ‘examen’
means the tongue of a pair of scales which
works 111 the handle. ‘Castigare' is to
correct, and Persius tells his friend not
to waste his time 111 correcting the false
index in the scales of public judgment, but
to examine himself and be his own mirror,
not looking for himself out of himself, that
is in the opinion of the world.
