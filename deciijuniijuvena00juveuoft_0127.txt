SATIRA lv. 77

SATIRA IV.

INTRODUCTION.

TER man Crispinus mentioned in the first satire (v. 26) as a eoxcomb who had been im-
ported a slave, and had risen to consequence by the favour of Domitian, is here introduced
again. A piece of extravagance of his is made the handle for introducing the story of a
fish of immense size which was once caught in the Adriatic, and presented by the fisher-
man to Domitian at his country pulace on the Alban lake. The tyrant, by way of
showing his contempt for the senate, summoned them suddenly, as if on matters of state,
to attend him from Rome, sor the purpose of giving their opinions upon the flsh and the
manner of dressing it. The satire turns upon this point, the degradation of the senators,
some of them honoumble men, whom, as well as others who were not so, he mentions by
name. The poem was written after the death of Domitian, which is referred to in the
last two lines. It is difficult t0 say how soon after, but Crispinus still retained the
wealth he had aequired under Domitian, and we may believe it did not stay with him
long under the next reignS. The sketches of the different senators are very good. They
are evidently drawn from life ; and no better scene was wanted or could be invented to
represent the abject condition of the priucipal men of Rome under this insolent tyrant.

ARGUMENT.

Crispinus here again—and he must often play his part—monster, without a virtue
to redeem him. What use is all his wealth to him? The bad are never happy, much
laes the adulterer and the incestuous. But now of smaller matters ; though in another
this were bad enough. But what is to be done where men are worse than all that can
be said of them ⁴?

V. 15. He bought a mullet of six pounds for as many sestertia: not as a present for
some rich old man or for his mistress3 no, he bought it for himself. He, the Egyp-
tian slave! a fish cost more than the man that caught it, nay, more than an estate
in the provinces. that shall we think that emperors eat when such a side-dish
gorges the parasite of the court, now first of equites, who used to cry stale fish in his
native place?

V. 34. Let’s sit, Calliope ; tell a true tale, ye Muses chaste and young: and since Ι eall
you so give me your favour.

V. 37. When our last Flavius was torturing the world, it happened a huge fish was
taken at Ancona, not less than they which after winter's ice float from Maeotis to the
Euxine. The monster straight is marked for the high-priest, for who would dare to
sell it with the coast full of informers, ready to swear the fish was reared in the
imperial ponde, and must go back to its lord? They tell us all that's good in the sea
belongs to the privy purse‚ so it's sent as a present in fear of confiscation.

V. 56. The winter had set in ; the manin haste, as if ’twas summer and the fish would
spoil, makes for the palace. And when he gets to the lakes where Vesta dwells, a
crowd admiring stops him; when it parts the doors fly open ς the senate waits with-
out. He's brought to the great man. “Accept (says he) an offering too big for
private tables: make merry, eat, this fish was kept for Caesar's days, Itself was
anxious to be caught.’' The flattery is too gross, and yet his feathers rise ; greatness
will swallow any thing. But now there is no dish to hold the monster. So he calls a
oouncil of the men he hates, and on whose faces sit the terrore of a great man’s
friendship.
