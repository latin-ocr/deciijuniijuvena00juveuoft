Α. PERSII FLACCI

‘ Dinomaches ego sum,' suffla ; ‘ sum candidus.’ Esto, 20
Dum ne deterius sapiat pannucea Baucis,
Cum bene discincto cantaverit ocima vernae.
Ut nemo in sese tentat descendere, nemo,
Sed praecedentis spectatur mantica tergo !

Quaesieris, ‘¹ Nostin’ V ectidii praedia?” “ Cujus ?’'

“ Dives arat Curibus quantum 11011 milvus oberret.”
“ Hunc ais, hunc Dis iratis Genioque sinistro?
Qui quandoque jugum pertusa ad compita figit,

23. Ut nemo in. sese tentat] Here the
poet leaves Alcibiades and his teacher, to
derive from the scene he has described a
lesson against self·ignorance. To go down
into oneself as into a dark mine or cavern
is an expressive phrase. Aesop's story of
the two wallets is referred to among many
other writers by Horace, S. ii. 3. 299:
“ Respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergo‚’'
where see note. According to the original
fable each man carries his neighbour’s
vices in a wallet on his breast, and is con—
tinually looking into it, while his own he
swings on his back and never sees them.
Persius makes the man looking with satis-
faction at the wallet 011 the back of one
›who is walking before him3 thereby slightly
varying the fable. [Phaedrus (iv. 9) has
told the fable well in three lines:

“ Peras imposuit Jupiter nobis duas:
Propgiijs‘ repletam vitiis post tergum
Aliiaeiiiss {inte peetus suspendit gravem.”

In v. 24 of Persius Jahn has ‘praece-
denti.'

25. ]ῼιιαεείενῖε, Nostin’ T'ectidii prae-
dia ?] He supposes by way of example
some one to ask whether he is acquainted
with Vectidius' estate. The man asks
‘which Vectidius ἴθ’ and he explains by
saying he has immense estates at Cures.
WVhereupon the other takes him up,
‘⁴ that, do you mean that stingy wretch,
who blesses himself if he opens a jar of
wine on a holiday, eating a raw onion and
gulping his sour driuk, while his slaves
are making merry with a pot of por-
ridge ?'’ He means that people will only
find what harm they can 111 a man, and
exaggerate it, and never think of his better

ualities.

q In ‘ Vectidii’ the second syllable is
lengthened by the contraction of the two
last, the penultimate vowel being sounded
as a ‘y.' Jahn reads Vettidi, and Hein-

rich shows how frequently in the same
name ‘ c' and ‘t' are interchanged. Jahn
says this is due to the ignorance of the
middle ages, and that in inscriptions the
name Vettidius is often found, but Vec-
tidius never. That does not decide the
ease against the MSS„ which are for the
most part in favour of Vectidii.

‘Cures' is the Sabine town in which
tradition said Numa was born. The cir-
cumstance of Vectidius being a Sabine
might account for his thriftiness, for which
those people were proverbial. But his
neighbours chose to take the worst view of
it. As to ‘quantum non milvus oberret '
see Juv. ix. 54, sq. :

“Dic, passer, cui tot montes, tot praedia
Αῐῖἒιξῖεἰερέοὺ milvos intra tua pascua
assos.

‘Dis iratis Genioque sinistro' are abla-
tives of quality. We need not understand
‘ natus' because Horace says, “Iratis
natus paries Dis atque poetis.” The man
was ‘ Dis inimicus‚’ the gods hated him,
and his Genius was adverse to him ; he
was born bad. See note on S. ii. 8.

28. quandoque jugum pertusa ad com-
pita fiyit‚] This is obscure. Forcellini
renders ‘pertusa’ ‘pervia,' which Jahn
adopts, and adds in the words of the
Scholiast, “quia in omnes partes patent.''
Heinrich explains it by ‘calcata,' ‘trita‚'
and this seems to be near the meaning.
There were holes in the road from weather
and use. But it is not certain what the
man is about. Heinrich, Jahn, and most
of the old eommeutators, understand that
he is making an offering to the Lares Com-
pitales at their festival, the Compitalia,

which was held at the beginning of -

J anuary with a good deal of eating and
drinking. But there is nothing about the
Compitalia in the text, which only says
that the man sometimes hung up a yoke
