SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 397

of Roman satire; nnd the summnry of ethies that goes before hns become proverbial.
A specimen of sensuality, und its consequenccs, forms a ‹lrnmntic sketch of much power ;
and when, in conclusion, he who is satisfied with himself, and who in his erenpnlse
und quiet veins reads the tokens of a healthy mind nnd body, is told to wuit till
temptation comes to try his lusts, his appetite& his passions, it is impossible not to feel
that in this Sntire much hus been <lone to expose the vicious to themselves, to touch
them the penalties of soff-indulgence, and to point out the true way to a lise of
innoecnce and peace.

ARGUMENT.

ch, so it always is, we snore till noon, till yesterday’s dehauch is slept away. ‘ Get
up, for shame ς the licat is parching up the corn, the cattle long have sought the
shade’cries one. *What-l can it be! quick, some onel where are yon all ?’ The
man gets furious and roars, you’d think Arcadia had turned loose her asses. At
last he takes his paper, parchment, pens, and then complains the ink won’t write ;
now it's too thick, and now too pale. You wretched man, and are we come to this ⁴?
Why don't you go and cry for pap again, and squall when the nurse sings lullabies
to soothe you ‚⁹ ‘ But what's the use of such a pen as this P’ Whom do you think
to cheat? What means this nonsense Ρ You cheat yourself, running away to
waste ; you’ll come to be despised 3 a pot that rings not, made of ill-baked clay. Go
to the potter and be made anew. Oh! but you're got a family estate, and all you
want upon it; this is enough for you. Is this enough to make you burst with
pride, a Tuscan pedigree and doting censor? Off with your decorations to the
vulgar: I know you inside, outside, all of you. You’re not ashamed to take Natta
the profligate for your example.

V. 32. But such as he have some excuse. They're dull from natural defect, and fat,
and ignorant, and know not what they lose ; mere things that sink to the bottom
and appear no more. Great Father, Ι desire no greater punishment than this for
tyrants: let them see Virtue’s form, aud pineto think they have abandoned her.
No turtures of their own are like to this, despair and terrors that the dearest may
not share.

V. 44. Ι shirked my tasks, I know, when yet a schoolboy, and thought that play was
every thing. But you have studied in the schools, and learnt the Stoics' wisdom and
the way of life ; and yet you snore till now, and yawn away until your jaws are out
of joint. What, have you any aim in life at all, or are you pelting crows all day,
careless of where you go, living but for the passing hour Ρ

V. 63. Meet the disease when it begins, or afterwards no medicine will avail. And
what’s the use of feeing doetors ? Go home, ye wretches, learn the first principles
of action 3 what we are, what our destiny3 our place in the course, the way to turn
the goa13 the limits of desire and getting; the use of money ς what we owe to coun-
try and to friends 3 what God would have us be 3 what place we occupy among our
kind. Learn ; and envy not the lawyer and his fees.

V. 77. Here some rough captain eries: ‘ 1 know enough for me ς I‘ve no ambition to
become a sege, with eyae downcast, and muttering to himself, and meditatiug sick
men’s dreams, as how that nothing comes from nothing, and to nothing nothing goeS.
Is this why you're so pale Ρ Is it for this a man's to lose his dinner θ’ And then the
vulgar laugh, and the young officers curl up their nose and giggle.

V. 88. A man consults his doctor, and he hids him go to bed. After three days he
feels a little better, borrows a jar of wine, and goes to bathe. ⁴ Why, friend,
you're looking pale! ‘ ’'l‘is nothing.’ ‘ well, but you’d better see to it; your
skin looks dark and puffy.' ‘ Nay, you look worse than 1 do: hold your tongue 5 Ι
