SATIRA III.

Tertia compositas vidit nox currere venas,

“ Heus, bone, tu palles !” “ Nihil est.” “ Videas tamen istud

Quicquid id est: surgit tacite tibi lutea pellis.’'

“ At tu deterius palles; nc sis mihi tutor3

Jam pridem hunc sepeli : tu restas.” “ Perge, tacebo.''

Uncta cadunt laxis tunc pulmentaria labris.

92. De majore domo] He sends to some
neighbour richer than himself a small
jar, and begs for some mild Surrentine
wine, as he is going to get up and bathe.
‘Modicum sitiente’ only means that it
holds little: it is not very thirsty. [Jahn
has ‘modice.’] The wine of Surrentum
(Sorrento) did not bear a high character.
See note on Horace, Epp. i. 15. 16. ‘ La-
gena' and ‘ amphora' were the same.
Atter the man has had his wine and his
bath, his doctor meets him and tells him
he looks pale ς and when the man says it
is nothing, he sayS, whatever it is 118 must
see to it; his skin is beginning to swell.
The patient gets angry, and tells him he
does not look as bad as the doctor himself ς
he doesn't want him for his guardian, who
is dead and gone long ago. “You are
alive,’' he adds3 by which he means 118
wishes he was dead, as Horace does in that
amusing didogue, S. i. 9. 26, sqq. :

“ -- Est tibi mater,
Cognati, quis 18 salvo est opus Ρ Haud
mihi quisquam 3
Omnes composui. Felices ! Nunc ego
resto.”

The doctor, in despair, tells him to go his
owggwssrhqigqlligfflhffiyessglssffressee Horace,
Epp. i. 6. 61, “ Crudi tumidique lavemur,’'
and Juv. i. 142, “ Poena tamen praesens‚’'
ὅω. [⁶ lentum,' Heinrich’s conjecture]
100. Sed tremor inter vina subit] ‘ Sed ’
means, ‘nay more,' that is, without bath-
ing, before he leaves the table. ‘Triental '

is the name of a cup holding one-third of
a sextarius, or four cyathi. The usual
name is ‘triens,' and most MSS. have
‘trientem' here. But the other form
which only occurs 11818 is not likely to
have been invented. The man is drink-
ing ‘ calda,' hot neguS‚ which the Romans
were very partial to. See Juv. S. v. 63 :
“ Quando vocatus adest calidae gelidaeque
minister.” ‘Dentes retecti’ are teeth
from which the gums have receded‚ as they
do from the effect of sever. They now
chatter with the chill of death. As to
‘pulmentaria' see Juv. vii. 185.

103. Hinc tuba, candelae‚] ‘ Hinc’
means ‘after this-³ Immediately aster
death among other ceremonies the friends
set up loud eries, and horns were blown,
and a great noise was made, in the hope
that the deceased might still show signs of
life. When this was over, they cried
‘conclamatum est,' ‘the eries are done‚’
and there was no hope. VVhereupon the
body was washed and anointed by a ser-
vant (pollinctor) of the undertaker‚ and if
the deceased was a free man his toga was
put round him (Juv. iii. 172: “Nemo
togam sumit nisi mortuus’'). The body
was then (‘tandem,’ after all the pre·
liminary performances) laid on a ‘lectus
funebris,’ and the bed, as it appears from
this passage, was placed 111 1118 (8111111113
with the feet of the dead towards the door.
Aster the body had lain in state a certain
number of dayS, it was carried out to be
burnt. The procession is described in my
note on Hor. S. i. 6. 43 : “ Concurruntque
