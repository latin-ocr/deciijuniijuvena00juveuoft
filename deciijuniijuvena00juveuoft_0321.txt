Anuosam si forte nucem dejecerat Eurus.

At nuuc divitibus coenandi nulla voluptas,

Nil rhombus, nil dama sapit, putere videntur
Unguenta atquc rosae, latos nisi sustinet orbes
Grande ebur et magno sublimis pardus hiatu
Dentibus ex illis quos mittit porta Syenes

Et Mauri celeres ct Mauro obscurior Indus,

Et quos deposuit Nabathaeo bellua saltu

Jam nimios capitique grave-S.

Hinc stomacho vires3 nam pes argenteus illis

Annulus in digito quod ferrcus.
Convivam caveo, qui mc sibi comparat et res
Adeo nulla uncia nobis

Despicit exiguas.

Est eboris, nec tessellae, nec calculus cx hac
BIateria: quin ipsa manubria cultellorum
Ossea 3 non tamen his ulla unquam obsonia fiunt

Rancidula, aut ideo pejor gallina secatur. >g

124. quos mittit porta Syenes] Syene
being a frontier town in Upper Egypt,
through which the traffic from Aethiopia

, is called ‘portae So above he
speaks of “Idumaeae Syrophoenix incola
portae '' (viii. 160, if the verse be genuine,
which I doubt). The Nabathaei and
Idumaei were not very clearly distin-
guished at the time Juvenal wrote, parts
of Arabia Petraea being occupied by each.
Arabia never produced elephants, and
they are not now found and perhaps never
were in the north of Africa. The elephant
dropping his tusks when they grow too
large for him is afable. Pliny tells one or
two more (H. N. viii. 3).

127. ,Hinc surgit orez-iffi] This gives
them an appetite: “magis illa juvant
quae pluris emuntur ” (v. 16). ‘Orexis' is
used in vi. 428. Many MSS. have ‘ bilis '
where others have ‘vires.’ In his
second edition Ruperti adopts ‘bilis.’
But that could only mean a sui-seit, and
Juvenal does not mean to say that. The
old-fashioned people and those who were
not entitled to wear gold rings wore them
of iren, the universal practice of the olden
time. See note on Hor. S. ii. 7. 9.

130. qui me sibi comparat] P. and the
Scholia-st [and Jahn and Ribbeck] have
‘comparet :’ but there is no reason for
the subjunctive here, and all the other
MSS. have the indicative. ‘ Ergo ’ is used

for snmming up. He has described these
fine people and their ways, and then says
he will have nothing to do with them, for
they would only despise his poverty 3 and
then he goes back to describe his own
fare and household.

131. Adeo nulla uncia nobis] “ Such is
my contemptible condition that 1 have ac-
tually not an ounce of ivory‚'' which was
aconvcntional quantity. It was the unit
in many calculations. He says in iii. 84:
“Usque adeo nihil est‚’' is it so entirely
nothing? ‘Nec' is ‘not even' (S. xi.
52 ς xiii. 97). ‘Tessellae' are little dice.
‘ Calculus ³ is a eounter for playing a garne
common among the ¹Romans, and like
our draughtS. See Dict. Ant.. arts. ‘ Tes-
sera' and ‘ Latrunculi,' where an engraving

rials: ivory was a later substance for
them. His very knife handles were of
bone, he says: it must have been there-
fore more common for the rich to have
them of ivory.

tor ’ see v. 120, n. ‘ Pergula ’ is properly

variety of ways particularly as a school,
which is its use here (sce Forcellini). He
says his curvet· is not such that the whole
school would acknowledge his superiority.
