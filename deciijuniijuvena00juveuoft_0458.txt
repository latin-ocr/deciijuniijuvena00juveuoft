A. PERSII FLACCI

REM populi tractas? (barbatum hacc crede magistrum
Dicere, sorbitio tollit quem dira cicutae‚)

Quo fretus, dic, 0 magni pupille Pericli.

Scilicet ingenium et rerum prudentia velox

Ante pilos venit ; dicenda tacendaque callcS. 5
Ergo ubi commota fervet plebecula bile,

1. Rem populi traetas?] See Introduc-
tion. ‘ Rem populi ' is equivalent to ‘ rein

publicam! As to ‘cicuta,’ see Juv. vii.

3. Quofretus,] Here he follows closely
Socratcs' lang-uage in Plato’s dialogue.
He supposes Alcibiades in his pride to
match himself against the king of Persia,
and the queen-mother to wonder ὅτῳ ποτὲ
πιστεύων ἐν νῷ ἔχει οὗτος ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης τῷ
Ἀρταξέρξῃ διαγωνίζεσθαι. She answers
herself, οὐκ ἔσθ’ ὅτῳ ἄλλῳ πιστεύων πλὴν
ἐπιμελείᾳ τε καὶ σοφίᾳ, ταῦτα γὰρ μόνα ἄξια
λόγου ἐν ”Ελλησι. Socrates continues,
ἐπεὶ εἴ γε πύθοιτο ὣς ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης οὗτος
νῦν ἐπιχειρεῖ, πρῶτον μὲν ἔτη οὐδέπω
’γεγονὼς σφόδρα εἴκοσιν, ἔπειτα παντάπασιν
ἀπαίδευτος, οἶμαι ἂν αὐτὴν θαυμάσαι τε καὶ
ἐρέσθαι, τί οὖν ποτ’ ἔστιν ὅτῳ πιστεύει τὸ
μειράκιον; Τ110 MSS. instead of ‘ o,' which
Heinrich reads, have ‘hoc' or ‘haec.’ I
do not take either of these to be right.

— mayni pupille Pericli] Clinias the
father of Alcibiades was killed at the
battle of Coroneia, Rc. 447, and left liis
son (whose age at the time is uncertain,
buthe was quite a child) under the care
of Pericles and his brother Ariphron, who
were second cousins, as we should call
them, of Dinomache, the mother of Alci-
biades. The forn] Pericli or Pcriclei is
like Ulixei (Hor. Epp. i. 7. 40, 810.) and
Achillei (C. i. 15. 34), from a nominative
Pericleus, the last syllable of the genitive
being open or contracted according to con-
venience.

4. Scilicet ingenium] This is ironical,
and taken from the above passage of Plato.
‘ Rerum prudentia' is a knowledge of the
world. See note 011 Hor. C. iv. 9. 35,
“Est animus tibi Rerumque prudenS.'’
‘Ante pilos' is ‘before the beard.’
cenda tacendaque' means‘ all sorts of
things.' See note on Hor. Epp. i. 7. 72:
“Dicenda tacenda locutus Tandem dor-
mitum dimittitur.''

6. Ergo ubi commota] ‘Ergo‚’ because
you are so early wise, you are eager to go
among the people, and wave down their
noise with the majestic motion of your

honesty; of which Socrates makes him
confess hc knows nothing: οὐκοῦν ἐλέγχθη
ὅτι περὶ δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων Ἀλκιβιάδης
ὅ καλὸς ὁ Κλεινίου οὐκ ἐπίσταιτο· οἴοιτο
δὲ καὶ μέλλοι εἷς ἐκκλησίαν ἐλθὼν συμ-
βουλεύσειν Ἀθηναίοις περὶ ὧν οὐδὲν
οἶδεν; οὐ ταῦτ’ ’ἧν; Ἀλκ. φαίνεται (Steph.
ii. 113). In ‘quid deinde loquereP'
Jahn sees an allusion to the young
man's thoughtlessness in not preparing
his speech before 110 goes in. This is a
strange remark. Socrates takes it for
granted he will say what he puts into
his mouth. For ‘puto’ most MSS. have
‘puta’ [and also Jahn] The other
seems to be required. The speaker ex-
presses his own opinion. Priscian and
Servius both quote the line with ‘puta,’
observing that the last syllable in ‘puta,’
which some call an adverb, is short. As to
‘libra' see S. i. 7, n. As to ‘curva' see
S. iii. 52. ‘ Regula’ is properly a straight
ruler. Here it is put, as part for the
whole, for ‘norma‚' which was composed
of two ‘regulae’ joined at right angles.
These are the ‘pedes' here referred to,
and 110 supposes the instrument to have
been bent and the angle altered. What
he says is, You can weigh justice in the
scales and tell when it is wanting-3 and
you can distinguish a straight line when
you see it among curves, or from the
diverging line formed by a ‘norma ³ when
its legs are out of the perpendicular. You
know also how to set your black mark
against vice. eis for θάνατος. According
to the Scholiast here (to whose authority
Pium adds Isidorus, Hispal. Etymol. i. 20.
23, and Asconius, ad Cic. pro Scauro) the
Greek dicasts declared their verdict of
condemnation by this letter as the Roman
(condemno). Martial
has an epigram (vii. 37) of which the
lemma is “Ad Castricum de Theta.” It
begins

“Nosti mortiferum quaestoris, castrice,
signum?

Est operae pretium discere theta
novum.”
