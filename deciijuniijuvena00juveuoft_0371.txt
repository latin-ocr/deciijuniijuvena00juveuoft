SATIRA XIV.

Arida cum tota descendat aranea tela 3

Hic leve argentum, vasa aspera tergeat alter,”
Vox domini furit instantis virg-amque tenentis.
Ergo miser trepidas nc stercore foeda canino

Atria displiceant oculis venientis amici,
Nec perfusav luto sit porticus,

(et tamen uno

Semodio scobis haec emendat servulus unus)
Illud non agitas ut sanctam filius omni
Aspiciat sine labe domum vitioque carentem.

Gratum est quod patriae civem populoque dedisti

Si facis ut patriae sit idoneus, utilis agris,
Utilis et bellorum et pacis rebus agendis
Plurimum enim intererit quibus artibus et quibus hunc tu

Moribus instituas.

See S. x. 19, 11. These are here expressed
by ‘leve argentum,’ which is the reading of
P. and the lemma of the Scholiast, whose
note however belongs to ‘ aspera '—“ Ana-
glipha sigillis: Virgilius, et aspera siqui-9³³
(Aen. v. 267). Neai-ly all the MSS. have
‘ lavet,’ which Lubinus has and most of the
old editions, but none of the modern ex-
cept Achaintre. ‘Arida ³ may apply to the
spider in the sense of lean and withered, or
to the web, for which it is a fit epithet, as
‘ dr .’

Gli. IVec perfusa luto] The reading of
most MSS. and all the modern editions
but Heinrich's is ⁴ Ne ;' but ‘ Nec ’ seems to
be wanted. He would not have the ‘atrium‚’
which was the first room the guests would
enter, show that dogs had been there, nor
have him see the ‘porticus' even splashed
with rain. It was outside the house, or he
means the ‘ peristylium ' or else the galleries
on each side of the ‘ impluvium,’ and in any
case it was open to the weather. The plural
‘ atria ’ is commonly used by the poets for
the convenience of their verse ; but as the
room had two wings (alae) opening upon it,
and the whole formed one apartment, the
plural is not without meaning. This being
the most public room 111 the house and
open to the sky, dogs may have had greater
licence there than in other rooms.

-—- uno Semodio scobis] With half a mo-
dius of saw-(lust, which the Romans com-
monly used for cleaning the floors, espe-
cially after dinner when the seraps were

cleared away, and usually it was scented.
See note on Hor. S. ii. 4. 81. The ‘sc-

Scrpente ciconia pullos

modius' was very nearly a gallon of our
measure. ‘ Unus ³ twice repeated, ‘semo-
dio,’ and ‘servulus' are all emphatic, to
mark the trifling character of the job and
the folly of the master's excitement.

70. patriae civem populoque dedisti]
‘⁵ You have given your country (and a wel-
come gift it is) a good citizen, if you have
made him (your son) fit for her service.”
The construction is a little irregular : ‘ dabis
si feceris' would be more exact, but the
perfect ‘dedisti' supposes a thing done
which is however only hypothetical. ⁴ Ido-
neus ' is explained by what follows. ‘ Civis '
is emphatic, 35 111 S. iii. 3; iv. 90, and
‘Quiritem,’ viii. 47. ‘Civis' is a word
always used with respect. The formula
‘patriae populoque' is used by Horace,
C. iii. 6. 20; “Ιῐ1 patriam populumque
fluxit,” and in Ovid. Met. xv. 572: “pa-
triae laetum populoque Quirini? Bentley
(on Hor. 1. 0.) would change ‘patriae' in
Ovid and this place of Juvenal (“ Vah!
quam inficeta et inconcinna repetitio est
patriae, patriae '’) into ‘ patribus‚' and in
Horace he has changed it into ‘ Inque pa-
tres? Τ110 formula, 35 Gronovius says on
Livy xxv. 6, is equivalent to ‘ Senatus po-
pulusque.'

73. Plurimum enim intererit] ‘ Enim '
means that it depends upon the father
whether the 5011 proves a good citizen,
for it will make a great difference in what
way he trains him. There is this force in
‘ tu.'

711⁴. Serpente ciconia pullos] Pliny
(H. N. x. 23) says that in Thessaly stoi-ks
