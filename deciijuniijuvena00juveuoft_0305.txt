Erubuit nempe haee eeu fastidita ; repulsa-

Coneussere ambae.

Quum stimulos odio pudor admovet.

SATI ΒΛ X. 255
Nec Stheneboea minus quam Cressa excanduit, et se
thlier saevissima tune est
Elige quidnam
330

Suadendum esse putes eui nubere Caesaris uxor

Destinat. Optimus hic et formosissimus idem
Gentis patriciae rapitur miser exstinguendus

Blessalinae oeulis : dudum sedet illa parato
Flameolo, Tyriusque palam genialis in hortis

Sternitur, et ritu decies centena dabuntur

335

Antiquo3 veniet cum signatoribus auspex.
Haec tu secreta et paucis commissa putabas.

328. Concussere ambacu] Forcellini ex-
plains this, they roused themselves to ven-
geance. And so Britannicus says. lt means
they were exeited to madness. He adds
that woman is never so savage as when
shame adds its sting to hate. ⁸ Pudor ' is
not commonly used for the shame of guilt,
the foundation of which is a remnant of
modesty, and ‘ pudor ’ in this sense is out-
raged modesty.

329. Elige quidnam] “ Choose what ad-
vice you think should be given to him
whom Caesar’s wife resolves to marry.''
The story of Messalina and C. Silius here
referred to has been mentioned above (S.
vi. 115, n.). The Silia gens was not patri-
cian but plebeiam and not much (listin-
guished. But this was not material in the
present instance, where Juvenal is speaking
of the giflz of beauty and its fatal conse-
quences. Silius' father had been consul,
and he was consul elect in the year Λα).
47. Tacitus calls Silius “juventutis Ro-
manae pulcherrimum '³ (Ann. xi. 12). J u-
venal says he was also ‘ optimus :¹ if so, liis
virtue was not proof against the temptation
of such a connexion and his sear of Mes-
salina's anger. Tacitus says Silius (whom
Messalina induced to put away his wife)
was not ignorant of the greatness of the
sin or of the danger, but being certain of
death if he rejected her, and having some
hope of escaping discovery, at the same
time attracted by the great prizes within
his reach, he consoled himself with waiting
for the future aad enjoying the present mo-
ment. The intrigue was carried on without
any concealmeut on the part of Messalina ,-
but according to Tacitus it was Silius who
proposed to her that they should marry,
and she with some reluctance, fearing lest
she should lose herbold upon him, consented

(Anu. xi. 26). It suits Juveual’s purpose
to give a different version of the story, or
he may have heard and believed what he
εἵη-ε, that the man had no choice but eom-
pliance or death.

332. rapilur miser exstinguendus] He
is hurried to his death by Messalina's eyes:
‘ oculis ' depends on both. As to ⁸ flameolo '
see note on ii. 124, and ou ‘lectus genialis ’
see vi. 22, n. Here it was covered, as bc-
came the occasion, with ‘ stragulae vestes '
of purple. See note on Hor. S. ii. 3. 118,
and ii. 4. 84· ε “Et Tyrias dare circum illuta
toralia vestes.’' As to ⁴ decies centena ' see
note 011 S. vi. 136. ‘Ritu antiquo ' refers
to the ‘'dos,’ not to the amount of it. The
‘ signatores ’ were witnesses to the marriage
contract. See ii. 119, n. : “ Signatae
tabulae.’' Tacitus (Anu. xi. 27) describes
the marriage in the same way z “Adhibitis
qui obsignarent velut suscipiendorum li-
berorum causa (these three last words were
part of the formula in the ‘ tabulae spon-
sales ’) convenisse atque illam audisse aus-
picum verba, subisse, sacrificasse apud
deos, discubitum inter convivas ; oscula,
complexus3 noctem denique actam licentia
conjugali :’'‘ that all this should have taken
place so publicly, he says, must appear fa-
bulous. Suetonius says (Claud. 26) ι “ C.
Silio nupsisse, dote etiam inter auspices
consignata.” Cicero (de Div. i. 16) speaks
of the practice of taking the ‘auspicia' at
weddings as a thing retained only in name.
‘⁴ Nuptiarum auspices qui re omissa nomen
tantum tenent.'’ The ‘ auspices ’ were pro-
lably in attendance at mart-iuges of import-
ance, or at the signing of the eontract, and
went through some formula. They declax-ed

whether the day was fortunate. (See note
on S. ii. 117.)
