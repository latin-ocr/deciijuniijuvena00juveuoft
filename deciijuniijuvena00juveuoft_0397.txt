ὅ 17

Solus enim hoc Ithacus nullo sub teste canebat.
Nos miranda quidem sed nuper Consule J unio
Gesta super calidae referemus moenia Copti,
Nos vulgi scelus et cunctis graviora cothurnis.

Nam scelus, a Pyrrha quanquam omnia syrmata volvas, 30

Nullus apud tragicos populus facit.

Accipe nostro

Dira quod exemplum feritas produxerit aevo.
Inter finitimos vetus atquc antiqua simultas,
Immortale odium et nunquam sanabile vulnus

Ardet adhuc, Ombos et Tentyra.

26. Solus enim hoc Illinc-us] His coni-
panions had all perished, and he came alone
to the land of the l’haeacians (ν. 15. ιι.).
He says Ulysses might justly be suspected
of lying, for he could not prove his story
by any testimony but his own; whereas
what he is going to tell was a public thing
that happened only the other day.

27. nuper Consule Junio] Jahn, Her-
iffi. ngRssbssssssssf ³...fflz133AEsszff'0-‘l‘lffssss
was a consul of that name, Aemilius J un-
cus, in the reign of Commodus, ΑΛ). 182,
but none earlier ; and there is not the least
probability that Juvenal wrote so late as
that. The common and correct reading is
‘ J unio‚' and the consul referred to is
either Appius J unius Sabinus in the reign
of Domitian, ΑΛ). 84, or Q. Junius Rusticus
in the reign of Hadrian, aa). 119. See
Introduction. ‘Nuper’ does not fix the
time within a few years. See above, S. ix.
22, n. The sounding of ‘Junio' as two
syllables is a common licence. So ‘for-
tuitus' is of three syllables (xiii. 225),
‘ludium ’ of two (vi. 82). There are other
instances in Juvenal and all the poets.

28. moenia Copta] Coptos was a town
about ten miles north of Thebes which
came into importance under the l’tolemies‚
owing to a commercial road opened between
it and Berenice (Cosseir) on the Red Sea.
Pliny, vi. 23. Juvenal calls it a hot place,
as he called Meroe in vi. 527. ‘ Super'
means higher up the river.

29. Nos vulyi scelus] Hc says he is
going to tell of au outrage committed by a
whole people, and therefore notorious- an
outrage worse than any to bc found in all
the tragedies since the dcluge. He first
represents tragedy by thc ‘ cothurnus: the
thick-soled boot worn by tragic actors, and
the ‘ syrnia,’ their train (S. viii. 229, n.).
The deluge of Deucalion and Pyrrha is

{omngcznly taken for the beginning of time.

33. relus atque antiqua simultan] ‘ Ve-
tus' means that the quarrel is of long
standing, and ¹ antiqua ’ goes back to the
origin of it, which was long ago.

35. Ombos· et Tentyra] These two towns
still retain substantially their old names,
one being called Oinbou and the other Den-
derah, where there still stands a temple,
erected, it is supposed, by one of the Ptole-
mies, which is one of the principal ruins of
Middle Egypt. Ombi was about a hundred
miles higher up the river than Tentyra,
which was nearly opposite to Coptos on the
west side. Thebes lay between them. In
Ombi the crocodile was worshipped ; in
Tentyra they killed and ate it as at Ele-
phantine (v. 2), and so the people fell
out.

Plutarch tells us that in his day the
Oxyrhynchites, who held sacred a fish with
a sharp snout, and got their name from it
(Wilkinson calls it the mizdeh, a ‘ mormy-
rus ' remarkable among the fish of the Nile
for its pointed nosc, Anc. Eg. iii. 58, and
ii. p. 248, sqq„ 2nd series), went to war
with the CynopoliteS, the dog-worsliippers‚
because these ate the fish, and the others by
way of retaliation ate dogs (vol. ii. p. 72,
Wyt. de Iside et osiride). Pliny (H. N.
viii. 25) tells a wonderful story of the
boldness of the Tentyrites in attacking the
crocodiles. They swam into the river, he
says, got upon their backs, and when the
beasts opened their months they thrust in
acudgel which they held in both hands,
one at each end, and so steered the animals
to shore. When they got them there they
scolded them so that in alarin they vomited
the bodies they had caten, which then got
decent burial. No wonder that he adds,
the crocodilos kept away from the Tenty-
rites and were frightencd at thc very smell
of them. Seneca (Nat. Quacst. iv. 2) con-
firms Pliny's account.
