(Mart. viii. 44. 7). Among all Apollo's
attributes law was not one, and he is only
called ‘juris peritus ’ because he was always
listening to lawyers So Martial says (ii.
(34), ‘⁴ Ipse potest fieri Marsya causidicus‚’¹
because 1115 statue was in the Forum Ro-
manum. (See Hor. S. i. 6. 119, 11.)

130. Aegygsptius alque Arabarches,] This
title has caused a good deal of trouble. It
occurs in Cicero (Ad Att. ii. 17) where, as here,
the M SS. difl'er, some having ‘Arabarches‚'
and others ‘ Alabarches.’ Ernesti (Clavis)
says the sense and MSS. both favour ‘ Ala-
barches ’ (see end of this note). So also in
the Codex Justin„ iv. 61. 9, 3 duty upon
cattle imported from Arabia into Egypt is
variously written ‘ vectigal Alabarchiae ³ and
‘ Arabarcliiae.' The reading, however, is not
of much importance, for the meaning must
be the same even if the ν became corrupted
into l. The title must have been that of
some Roman officer of consideration in the
province of Egypt, whatever-his duties may
have been. They were discharged in 0110
instance, at least, by the governor of a dis·
trict, as appears by the inscription on Mem-
non’s statue quoted by ΜΓ. Mayor, where
Claudius Aemilius is said to be ἂραβάρχης
καὶ ἐπιστράτηγος Θηβαΐδος. Juvenal is
indignant that a provincial officer should
have had a public statue, with liis services
inscribed on the pedestal (titulos), set up
for him among the great men in the forum.
The notion of ‘ Alabarches' being derived
from ἄλαβα which Hesychius says means
ink, and therefore that the officer was
‘ scripturae praefectus,’ or collector of the
tax upon cattle, was first propounded, 30-
cording to Pullmann, by his contemporary
Cujacius, and sontelater editors have adopted
it (Ernesti does so in his ‘ Clavis' on Cicero,
mentioned above). Otherwise it would not
be worth noticing.

131. non tantum] ‘Non tantum' 15011-
plained by Horace S. i. 8. 38. Juvenal says
that 3 man may foul this fellow’s statue in
any way he pleases without offence. (See

I‘ers. i. 113.) Heinrich quotes 5010131111-
5133005 of ‘ 11011 tantum ' used in this ellip-
tical way, as Liv. x. 14, “Non vero tantuin
metu‚” where we are to add “sed etiam
ficto ;'' Plin. Epp. iii. 14, init„ “ Rem atro-
cem nec tautum epistola dignam,'’ where
Gesner supplies “ scd historia vel tragoedia

adige. restibulis abeunt] The τ vestibu-

lum ' was a porch leading from the street
to the door of the house. These porches
were only attached to large houses. In
them the retainers sat. And Juvenal says
when they came home with their patron,
they got no fai-ther than the porch, and,
receiving no invitation to dinner, they laid
aside their hopes for the first time, and
went away to buy a poor supper and firing
to dress it, while their lord and master went
iu to a fine dinner which he enjoyed by
himself. ‘ Rex,' as applied to the rich, is
very common in Horace. See C. i. 4. 14,
11. ; and below, v. 14. He says that of all
the hopes 11103 feed upon, they are least
willing to part with that of a good dinner.
Rigalti quotes 3 good answer of Epictetus to
Hadrian: “ Hadriano interroganti, quid est
longissimum Ρ Epictetus respondit, Spes?

134. caulis miseris atquez‘ynis emendus]
See above 1. 120.

137. et latis orbibus] These were
round tables made ot' various costly woods.
(Hor. S. ii. 2. 4, n.) They came into
fashion in Cicero's time ς and some may
have been preserved fron] that day, and
would justly be called ‘ antiqui.' (See
below, S. xi. 122.) The use of round
tables introduced a change in the distribu-
tion of the company usual in Horace’s time,
which was on the triclinium, or three
long couches round a table of three sides 10
correspond to them. The round tables did
not suit this arrangement, and semicircular
00301105 were introduced, with fewer people
on them. In large houses there would be
several of these in aroom. VVlioever wishes
to see 11011 much might be spent on a Ro-
