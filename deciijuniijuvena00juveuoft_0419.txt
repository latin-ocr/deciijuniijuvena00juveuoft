PROLOGUS.

INTRODL'CTION.

1⁶1· is generally supposed that Persius, in publishing his Satires or contemplating their
publication, wrote these few lines as a sort of Introduction. They have the appearance
οἶα fragment, aad it is not unlikely he meant to write more. By this suppositiou some
difficulty arising out of the want of connexion will be removed. The verses are no more
than an apology for his presumption iu presenting his oss'ering to the Muses. He says
he is conscious that he is no poet, and he seems to imply that he was driven to write by
want, as Horace says he was. But this can only have been meant by Persius for ajoke‚
and a way of introducing a stroke at the many poets of the day who wrote for patrous
and for what they could get. Some, including Casaubon, Passow, Jahn, take the verses
as a prologue only to the first Satire, which they suppose is meant by ‘ carmen nostrum '
in v. 7. The title is due to the grammarians, whatever Persius meant.

The metro is the choliambie or scazon, the trimeter iambic with a spondee in the lust

place, as in Catullus' ode which begins

‘⁴ O funde noster, seu Sabine, scu Tiburs.'’ (C. 44..)

Let hope of gain but shine upon them, and you would think our crows and magpies

were singing Muses’ nectar.
