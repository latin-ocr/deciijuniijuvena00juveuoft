occasionally by Romans under the empire.
The Laconian was a purple dye. Horace
says z

“ Nec Laconicas 1111111
Trahunt honestae purpuras clientae.’'

(c. 11. is. 7.)

Pliny mentions the Tyrian, Gaetulian, and
Laconian as the three best purples (H. N.
ix. 36; xxxv. 6). As to the Coan dresses
see notes on S. ii. 66, “ quun] tu multicia
51111135;” and vi. 259, “tenui sudant in cy-
clade.'’ ‘ Conchylia ' were shell fish from
which a purple was extr-acted. It was not
exactly the same as the ‘ purpura,’ though
not usually distinguished3 see S. iii. 81,
“Ηο111111 ego 11011 fugiam concliylia.” The
painter Parrhasius of Ephesus flourished at
Athens during the latter part of the Pelo-
ponnesian War; about the beginning of
which flourished Myron, the great sculptor,
who is the reputed artist of the δισκοβόλος,
of which casts and copies may be seen.
‘ Phidiacum ebur’ refers to the chrysele-
phantine statues of Phidias, the most cele-
brated of which were the statue of Athene
in the Parthenon, and of Zeus at Olympia.
Phidias was the oldest of the artists here
mentioned, but nearly the same age with
Polycletus of Argos (S. iii. 215), who also
executed a celebrated statue in ivory and
gold of Hera for her temple near ArgOS.
‘ Vivebat ' expresses the life-like character
of the statues. Mentor was a celebrated
artist in silver about the middle of the
fourth century B.c. His cups and other
works‚ or works which passed for his,
were highly esteemed by the Romans (see
Cic. in Verr. Act. ii. 4. c. 18, Long's note).

105. Inde Dolabella] Cn. Dolabella was
praetor of Cilicia Rc. 80, 79, aud on his
return to Rome was prosecuted for ‘ repe-
tundac,' extortion, and was convicted

chiefly on the evidence of C. Verres, his pro-
quaestor, who himself afterwards became
so notorious as the plunderer of Sicily.
See Long's Intr. to Cic. in Verr. p. 2, and
note on Act. i. c. 4. Dolabella was sent
into exile; and Verres went into voluntary
banislnnent rather than abide the result of
Cicero’s famous prosecution. C. Antonius,
uncle of the triumvir M. Antonius, was
proconsul of Macedonia, and on his return
to Rome was, like the others, prosecuted
for plundering the province3 and though
Cicero, whose colleaguc he had been in
the consulship, defended him, he was con-
victed and went into exile B.c. 59. Jahn
[and Ribbeck have] adopted a bad sug-
gestion of Ruperti'S, ‘inde Dolabellae at-

who plundered provinces. [Ribbeck has
also ‘ dehinc.']

107. plures de paee triumphos] He
says they got inore triumphs out of peace
than conquerors got from war, that is, more
spoils such as were carried in triumphal
processions. But now the ‘ socii ' have but
little left, and that little they are robbed of.
‘ Lares ’ is not to be taken strictly, for he
is not speaking of Romans; but other na-
tions had their heroes and tutelary godS‚ of
whom they kept images in their houses.
‘Aedicula’ is a small recess set apart for
the reception of these imagesz “ Stabat in
exigua ligneus aede deus '’ (Tibullus i. 10.
caiived or cast : ‘ statua ³ 15 confined to full-
length figures. (See Long's note on Cic. in
Verr. Act. ii. 4. c. 7.)

111. Haeo etenim sunt] Heinrich calls
this (haec—maxima) “a hideous bungling
of a noble piece of poetry: two wretched
glosses jammed into the text.” He says
‘ unicus ' should be ‘unus.' Heinecke had

‘ Signum ' is the word for any figure .
