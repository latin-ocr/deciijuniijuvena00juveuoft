D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Plebeiae Deciorum animae, plebeia fuerunt

Nomina: pro totis legionibus hi tamen et pro

Omnibus auxiliis atque omni pube Latina
Sufficiunt dis infernis Terraeque parenti3
Pluris enim Decii quam quae servantur ab illis.
Ancilla natus trabeam et diadema Quirini

Et fasces meruit, regum ultimus ille bonorum.

251. Plebeiae Deciorum aninme,] The
Decii were, as Juvenal sayS, a plebeian
family, but a very old one, sor at the seces-
sion of the plebS, Rc. 494, M. Decius
was one of the deputies sent by them to
ireat with the senate. P. Decius Mus was
the first consul of the family. B.C. 3803 in
that year he commanded the Roman forces,
in conjunctiou with his colleague, T. Manlius
Torquatus, in the Latin War. How and
why he devoted himself to death in battle,
and how he thereby securcd the victory to
the Romans, are told by Livy, viii. 9, who
there gives the formula of devotion. His
son, who had the same name, acted as his
father had done, when he was consul for
the fourth time, 13.C. 295, at the. battle of
Senlinum against the Gauls (Liv. x. 28).
His son also was consul 13.c. 279, and com-
manded in the war against PyrrhuS. At
the battle of Asculum it was given out
that he meant to devote himself as the
others had done3 and to prevent a panic. in
liis own army Pyrrhus gave orders that he
should be taken alive. Cicero says he did
devote himself, but that is generally be—
lieved to be a mistake (Quaest. Tusc. 1.
37; de Fin. ii. 19).

255. pro totis Ieffl'onibus] The formula of
devotion, after calling on the Dii Magni and
others, finished with these words: “Pro
re publica Quiritium, exercitu, legionibus,
auxiliis populi Romani Quiritium legiones
auxiliaque hostium mecum diis Manibus
Tellurique devoveo.'’ Juvenal says though
they were plebeians they were enough for
all the army and allies, and were worth
more than those they saved. In the formula.
‘ auxiliis ¹ included all the auxiliaries.
When Juvenal says ‘auxiliis atque omni
pube Latina: he means by ‘auxiliis ’ the
Italian auxiliaries, who were not strictly
called ‘auxilia ² but ‘ socii? until the Social
war, B.C. 90, when by the extension of the
Roman ‘ civitas ' to those states they ceased
to be ‘ socii ³ and became. a constituent part
of the Roman people. Previously to this
the Latini were always distinguished from

the other ‘socii’ (as here), the collective
formula being ‘socii et Latini‚' or its
equivalent ‘ socii Latini,’ where ‘et ' is
understood, as in ‘ Romani Quiritium?
¹ Patres conscripti? The common reading
‘plebe Latina' is not so good as ‘pul›e‚'
which is in P„ ‘the Schol„ and some other
MSS. [In v. 258 Ribbeck has ‘ quam qui.’]

259. Ancilla natus] This is Servius Tul-
11115, of whom he says (S. vii. 201) “ Servis
regna dabunt (fata).'’ The ‘ trabea ' was
11 white toga with waving stripes of purple
embroidered on it. It differcd from the
‘ praetcxta,’ which had only a single border
of purple round the edges. It was supposed
to have been worn by the king-s. Pliny (H.
N. ix. 39) says, ‘⁵ Purpurae usum Romae
semper fuisse video, scd Romulo in trabea.”
‘ Diadema' was a band, originally no doubt
of plain materials, which was worn by the
kiugs of Rome, and is found on busts of
Bacchus commonly. It was afterwards
highly ornamented with gold and precious
stones. Tullius was succeeded by Tar-
quinius Superbus, and so is not called the
last king, but- the last good king, as Livy
says “ cum illo simul justa. ae legitima.
regna occiderunt ” (i. 48). Tullius is said
to have earned the throne, that is by his
bravery and the virtues he showed while
exet-cising the power given him by his
father-in-law Tarquinius Priscus during
his lifetime. Livy gives him a high cha-
racter as a young man: “Juvenis evasit
vere indolis regiae ” (i. 40). He relatae
the stratagem by which Tanaquil, the wife
of Tarquinius Prisc-us, secured the succes-
sion for her son-in-law (i. 41).

261. Prodita lamabant] He refers to
Titus and Tiberius Junius Brutus, sons of
Brutus the first consul, who were in the
conspiracy for restoring Tarquinius Super-
bus, and who were seourged and put to
death by the sentence and under the eyes
of their own father. The conspirators
met- at supper and their conversation was
betrayed by ene of the slaves to the eon·
suls, Juvenal says they ought to have
