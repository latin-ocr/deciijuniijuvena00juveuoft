D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Respice nunc alia ac diversa pericula noctis :
Quod spatium tectis sublimibus, unde cerebrum

Testa ferit, quotics rimosa et curta fenestris

270

Vasa cadunt ,- quanto percussum pondere signent
Et- laedant silicem. Possis ignavus haberi
Et subiti casus improviduS, ad coenam si

Intestatus eas.

Adeo tot fata quot illa
Nocte patent vigiles te praetereunte fenestrae.

275

Ergo optes votumque feras miserabile tecum,

Ut sint contentae patulas defundere pelves.
Ebrius ac petulans qui nullum forte cecidit

Dat poenas, noctem patitur lugentis amicum

Pelidae, cubat in faciem, mox deinde supinus.

which speciinens still exist, was a copper
coin, one-third of an ‘ass The fancy about
Charon's fee was not known to the early
poets of Greeee, and is here only brought
in to be ridiculed. (See Becker, Chari-
kles.)

268. pericula omeliam] He passes from
the (langers of the day and the asternoon to
those of the night; tiles falling from the
roofs of tall houses, and old broken crockery
thrown out of the windows. Τὶιθ number
of ‘coenacula’ at this time was very great.
‘ Quod spatium tectis ³ means ‘ what a dis-
tance there is from the tops of the houses to
the street.' These lodging-houses were
built usually three stories high, but the law
was that they must not exceed seventy feet.
Glass windows have been found in several
of the honses at Pompeii. These houses at
Rome would have usually either no window-
frame and only apertures for the light and
air with shutters, or ‘specularia,’ which
were windows made of mica (‘lapis specu-
laris ³), used by the Romans before glass
was invented. It was not usual for Roman
houses to have windows facing the street
on any but the upper stories. According
to law if any damage was done by throwing
anv thing out of a window, the tenant of
the house was obliged to pay twice the
amount of the damage. See the title in the
Digest (9. 3) : “ De his qui effuderunt vel
dejecerunt.- Praetor ait de his qui dejece-
rint vel effuderint: Unde in eum locum
quo vulgo iter fiet, vel in quo consistetur,
dejectum vel effusum quid erit, quantum
ex ea re damnum datum factumve erit in
eum qui ibi habitavit ego duplum judicium
dabo.''

with a semicolon after ‘ferit.']

272. Possis ignarus haberi]

“ Prepare for death if here at night you
Aiidaslign your will before you sup from
home.” (Johnson.)

274. Adeo {ot fata] ‘ So surely do as
many deaths await you, as there are waking
windows open on that night while you are
passing? ‘Adeo' belongs to ‘tot fata’ and
to what follows : it means ‘ to this or that
degree,' ‘so' (Key's L. G. 799), but it can-
not always be translated in'that way: it
gives strength to the sentence it belongs
to, which is often grammatically complete
without it. Here it introduces the reason
why a man might be counted improvident
if he went out without making his will.
The windows are called ‘vigiles‚’ just as
the eating-houses are called ‘pervigiles'
(viii. 158), and a conch the same (xv. 43) 3
and the lights are called ‘vigiles' by Horace
(C. iii. 8. 14). The people behind the
windows were awake.

277. Ut sint contentae] That they may
be satisfied to discharge the contents of
their foot-pans, rather than the vessels
themselves on your head.

279. Dat poenas,] He suffers torture
if he has not had the luck to kill somebody:
he cannot sleep, but tosses on his bed like

Achilles when he mourned for Patroclus,
which Juvenal describes like Homer (11.
xxiv. 10, sq.):
ἄλλὲζιθ Ᾰἐπὶ πλευρὰς κατακείμενος, ἄλλοτε
αὐτ
ὕπτξος, &gaave δὲ πρηνὴς, τότε δ’ ὀρθὸς
