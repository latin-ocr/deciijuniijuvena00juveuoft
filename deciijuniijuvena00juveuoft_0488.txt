A. PERSII FLACCI

Nec rhombos ideo libertis ponere lautus,
Nec tenuem sollers turdarum nosse salivam.

Messe tenus propria vive, ct granaria, (fas est,)
Quid metuas? occa, et seges altera in herba cst.

Emolc.

Prendit amicus inops, remque omnem surdaque vota
Condidit Ioni03 jacet ipse in litore et una

Ingentes de puppe Dei, jamque obvia mergis
Nunc et de cespite vivo

of a hen thrush or fieldfare. The differ-
cnce of taste between a cock and a hen
was imaginary perhaps, but the masculine
here would have no force. Though the
MSS. differ therefore, and the masculine
is the vulgar reading, there is no doubt
the feminine is right. This the Scholiast
recognizes and explains: “‘turdarum'
abusive posuit cum ‘turdorum ' dicere
debuerit.'' Nearly all the MSS. have
‘tenues salivas,' which no editor has
adopted that 1 am aware of, except Dueb-
ner, who has introduced it into Casaubon’s
text. ‘Saliva’ is equivalent to ‘sapon'
as in Propertius (v. 8. 38, Paley)‚ “et M e-
thymnaei Graeca saliva ineri,'' where it
seems Hertzberg disputes this meaning.
There is no doubt about it here. ‘ Lautus
ponere‚’ ‘sollers nosse‚' is a construction
noticed 011 Prol. 11. Τ1115 sense of ‘lautus’
is common. Forcellini gives examples.
See Juv. xi. 1, “Atticus eximie si coenat
lautus habetur.'’

25. Messe tenus propria υἷας] We
should call this ‘living up to one's in-
come? He adds, ‘ don't hoard, but grind
all your grain. What have you to fear Ξ)
only harroxv your ground, and you get
another crop.' ‘ In herba’ is ‘ in the
bladeff Horace, Epp. ii. 2. 161, has“Cu1n
segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas‚”
where see note on ‘ occare.' ‘Quid metuas'
is better than ‘ metuis‚' which Jahn adopts,
and it has more MSS. authority. ‘Quid
metuas’ occurs in iii. 26.

27. Ast vocat officium ς] Τ1115 15 by
some taken to be an objection of the inan,
who does not like parting with his grain.
So Halliday translates it,—

“ Why, Ι should thus spend‚
But- duty hinders me: for my poor
H1fsl 156111ἓί being split,'’ ἃς.

Dryden and Gifford give the same sense,
which is not that of Persius. He sup-
poses a case in which a particular duty
calls for greater generosity. A friend is
wrecked, his property and the vows he
offered for its safety all buried alike in the
waves 3 he is cast 011 shore, and lies grasp-
ing the rocks with the ship’s gods lying
by him, and the gulls flying over the seat-
tered timbers as they float on the waters.
In this ease, he adds, you may go further,
and give the poor man a piece of your land
to save him from begging. ‘ Trabe ' is
used for a ship, as 111 S. v. 141, and Horace,
C. i. 1. 13, “ trabe Cypria.'' By way of
giving reality to the picture, he fixes the
place of the wreek on the south coast of
Italy, where 110 1105 like Palinurus in the
Aeneid. vi. 360, “ Prensantemque uncis
manibus capita aspera montis.’' ‘ Surdus'
is not used elsewhere 111 this sense exactly.
It means vows to which the gods are deaf.
there it means ‘ silent,' asin J uv. vii. 71 ;
xiii. 194, it is as being unheard, which is
an analogous use. As to Ionio, see Juv.
vi. 93, n. Iinages of gods were carried in
the stern of a ship. Ovid, describing a
storm he encountered 011 1115 voyage from
Rome, sayS‚

“Monte nec inferior prorae puppique re-
curvae

Insilit, et pictos verberat unda Deos.'’
(Trist. i. 4. 7, sq.).

‘De cespite vivo frange aliquid' is only
a way of expressing ⁶ give the man a piece
of land! ‘ Vivus cespes’ is used by Ho-
race twice for a turf altar, C. i. 19.13,· iii.
8. 4. As to the sailor and his picture, see
Juv. xiv. 302, Pers. i. 89.

33. Sed coenam funeris heres] He sup-
poses the man to be afraid of the revenge
his ‘ heres ' will take if 110 curtails his pro-
perty for such a purpose. ‘ Coena funeris ¹
