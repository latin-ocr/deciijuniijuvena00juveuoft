D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nemo tamen studiis indignum ferre laborem
Cogctur posthac, nectit quicunque canoris
Eloquium vocale modis laurumque momordit.

Hoc agite, o juvenes: circumspicit et stimulat vos

Materiamque sibi Ducis indulgentia quaerit.

Si qua aliunde putas rerum exspectanda tuarum
Praesidia, atque ideo croceae membrana tabellae
Impletur, lignorum aliquid posce ocius, et quac

Componis dona Veneris, Telesine, marito,

Aut clude et positos tinea pertunde libellos.
Frange miser calamos vigilataque proelia dele,
Qui facis in parva sublimia carmina cella

Ut dignus venias hederis et imagine macra.

Spes nulla ulterior : didicit jam dives avarus

Tantum admirari, tantum laudare disertos,

latia' in Smith's Dict. Geog.) ‘Nudo
talo’ may be compared with ‘pedibus
albis,' S. i. 111, though I am not sure that
the usual interpretation there is right.
‘Traducit' Heinrich is right in explaining
‘ puts forward to view,' comparing viii. 17,
“Squalentes traducit avos,'’ and xi. 31,
“loricam—in qua se traducebat UlixeS.''
Ruperti says it is not so, but that it means
‘brings across the seas to Rome ;' and so
Mr. Mayor takes it.

17. Nemo tamen studiis] He says no
poet henceforth need follow any 11111)οο0111-
ing business. He describes the poet as one
who joins the eloquence of words with the
harmonies of music, and has eaten the bay,
that is, the ‘laurea Apollinaris ' (Hor. C. iv.
2. 9), ‘ Delphica laurus ’ (C. iii. 30. 15),
where Bentley proposes a reasonable cor-
rection of Ovid (Ex Pont. ii. 5. 67), “ Del-
phica non aeque gustata est laurea vobis,''
where the common reading is ‘ gestata?

20. Hoc agita] This is a formula which
occurs in Horace (Epp. i. 6. 30), “ Si virtus
hoc una potest dare, fortis omissis Hoc age
deliciis.” ‘Set about it 3 lose no time’
(see v. 48). The phrase is used often in
Terence. Ruperti refers to several placeS.
Juvenal calls Domitian ‘ Dux magnus’
above, iv. 1453 and he uses the word as
{qpcilvatlent tiiffmpimabof tgoughhig {0th

e iwas ieren,s ‘ux a o
the ⁸ imperium’ or ‘auspicium.’ As to
‘croceae membrana tabellae‚' see S. i. 5,
n.; and Persius iii. 10, “bicolor positis
membrana capillis.” Casaubon there quotes
this line with the difference of ‘crocea
tabella,' which is the reading of P. and one

French MS„ and Pithoeus' edition, Heidel-
berg, 1590. Jahn [and Ribbeck] have it.

25. dona Veneris, Telesine, maritm] He
bids a man, if he depends on any patron
but Caesar, put his poenis in the fire, or, as
he says, give them to Vulcan, as Catullus'
mistress vowed:

“ Electissima pessimi poetae
Scripta tardipedi Deo daturam
Infelicibus ustulanda lignis.”

(xxxvi. 6, sqq.)

The name Telesinus occurs in inscriptions3
and Martial occasionally uses it and the
feminine Telesina (ii. 49). The MSS. have
Thelesine, but the inscriptions have Tel„
Τελεσῖνος. The Scholiast and P. and
some other MSS. have the older form,
‘ clude.’ Most MSS. have ‘ claude? The
same variation appears in S. iii. 19: “viridi
fi}..32¹3¹513}ss.‘{¹.5.¹³{¹}3‘{‡g33.¹¹.‘352⁸·.1,er} 2¹33 1]ξῖὲῖ
He bids the man loek up his books and let
the worms eat holes in them, break his
pens and rub out all the battles 110 had
wastcd his nights upon.

29. Ut dignus venias] That you may
come forth worthy of the ivy erown and a
poor lean bust, such as a half-starved poet's
would be. There were put up in the library
of Apollo on the Palatine, and. in other
public as well as private libraries, busts of
distinguished literary men. See note
on S. ii. 4: “quanquam plena omnia gypso
Chrysippi.'' ‘ Venire ' occurs in this way
above, S. ii. 83, ‘⁶ Nemo repente venit tur-
pissimus,’' where see note.
