Aegyptus 3 quippe illa nefandi Taurica sacri
Inventrix homines (ut jam quae earmina tradunt
Digna fide credas) tantum immolat, ulterius nil

Aut gravius cultro timet hostia.
Impulit hos? quae tanta fames infestaque vallo

Quis modo casus
120

Arma coegerunt tam detestabile monstrum
Audere ’.Ρ Α11110 3113111 terra Memphitide sicca
Invidiam facerent nolenti surgere Nilo?

Qua nee terribiles Cimbri, nec Britones unquam,

habited the Chersonesus which bore their
name (the Crimea). All the barbarous
tribes on the borders of the Palus Maeotis
(Sea of Azov) were called Maeotae. ‘ Illa
Taurica’ is that Tauric goddess 3 the Greeks
called her Artemis. Herodotus calls her
ἡ Παρθένος, and says that the natives named
her Iphigenia, and that they killed their
victims with a club and hung their heads
upon a cross. The heads of their enemies
they set up over their houses which they
were supposed to protect (iv. 103). ‘ Ut
jam ' is ‘ supposing only :' ‘jam ³ gives 0111-
phasis to ‘ut.' It is the particle most
nearly resembling the Greek δὴ 111 its com-
monest uses.

119. Quis modo casus Impulit hos ?]
‘Modo ' gives emphasis to ‘ quiS,' like τίς
ποτε ; it is “ what chance at all drove these
Egyptians to their crime P What so great
famine, what arms attacking their walls,
compelled them to dare so detestable‚ so
monstrous a deed ?'’ Heinrich says ‘ modo’
is for ‘ tamen‚' in which Ι think he is
wrong. “ The force of the particle will be
plain if we change the form of the sentence z
‘ His si quo modo essent casu impulsi,
ignoscendum erat.³
nothing more, drove these to the act ΡΜ
(Mayor.) This is not to transpose but to
alter the sentence, and the translation given
does not render it in either form.

122. Anne aliam terra Memphitide
sicea] ‘⁶ Could they, if the land of Mem-
phis were all dry, offer greater insult to the
Nile because he would not rise ?”

“ Se 13 terra di Menfi asciutta fosse,
E’ l N ilo colle 5110 soverchianti onde
Non volesse inondar l’ arse campagne‚
Qual far gli si potria scorno maggiore ?’'
(Accio.)

The English translators seem to have
missed the meaning. Till the Persian con-
quest (B.C. 525) Memphis and Thebes were
rivals in importance. Both were of fabulous

‘ What calamity, {f

antiquity. Memphis was always the chief
seat of commerce, while Thebes seems to
have been the residence of the kingS. Both
cities were greatly injured by the con-
querors (v. 6, n.).

124. Qua nec terribiles Cimbra] The
threatened invasion of the Cimbri and their
destruction by Marius is mentioned in viii.
249, sqq. The Cimbrica Chersonesus is
part of the modern kingdom of Denmark,
but whether these barbarians came from
thence is a difficult question. At the end
of Latham’s edition of Tacitus' Germania,
there is a note on the Cimbri in p. 133.
The same writer (Dict. Geog.) considers
thc Britones to be different from the Bri·
tanni; but they are at any rate not so
here. Forcellini says they are the inha-
bitants of the modern Bretagne. But that
is a mistake. There can be no doubt our
aneestors are meant, whose human sacri-
fices got them a bad name. See note on
Hor. C. iii. 4. 33 : “Visam Britannos hos-
pitibus feros.” As to the Sauromatae 500
S. ii. 1, n. The name in this place is more
limited than there.
Herodotus were said to be descended from
the Amazons, and to live between the Ta-
nais (Don) and the Rha (Volga) (iv. 21.
116). Their women never married till
they had killed an enemy. The Agathyrsi
Herodotus describes as persons of delicate
habits, who wore gold ornaments and had
their wives in common. Herodotus (iv.
49, 104) places them at the source of the
river Maris (Maras or Marosch) which
flows into the Tibiscus (Theiss) the largest
tributary of the Ister. If that be correct,
they occupied part of the modern Tran-
silvania and were Dacians. But other

The Sauromatae of ¹

writers place them further to the N.E., “ ⁷

nearer to the Sauromatae, with whom they
arc often mentioned. virgil speaks of them
as “ picti Agathyrsi ” (Aen. iv. 146). They
tattooed their skins and dyed their hair
blue.
