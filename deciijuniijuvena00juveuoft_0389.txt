Sensit Alexander, testa quum vidit in illa

The man is so eager to be oss' 011 his voyage
that he does not mind the tlireatening sky,
and says it is only summer thunder. Per-
haps the same night his ship goes to
pieces and he has to swim for his life, with
his money bags in his lest hand and in his
mouth. A purse was called ‘zona' from
being carried in the girdlc. See Hor.
Epp. ii. 2. 40, n.z “Ibit eo quo vis qui
zonam perdidit, inquit.” Heinrich thinks
it should 110 ‘morsuve' The MSS. have
‘ que,’ and he seems to mean that the man
carries his bags in both hand and mouth.

298. Sed cajus votis modo non] ‘ Sed'
seems to mean ‘but more than this? Hein-
rich takes ‘modo non' together, so as to
be equivalent to ‘vix.' Ι think he is mis-
taken, and that ‘ modo' is ‘ but now.' One
day saw the man with grand expectations‚
the next day saw him a beggar. He for
whom lately the gold of the Tagus had not
been enough will be satisfied with a rag
about his loins and a mor-sel of food got by
begging. Mr. Long thinks ‘ modo ’ belongs
to ‘ votis.' “ It limits the word to which it
is joined, as in ‘ tantum mod0,’ ‘ so much
and no more? So this expresses the ex-
travagance of the man’s wishes ; ‘ his bare
wishes ’ all Pactolus would not have satis-
fiedfl’ This is true, but here I still incline
to think ‘modo ' is ‘ lately! It is a com-
mon meaning.

299. Quod Tagus] See iii. 55, n. The
Pactolus was in Lydia. See Hor. Epod. xv.
20: “Tibique Pactolus fluat.” The pie-

tures of their wreck wlueh were hung up by
those who could afford it iu the temples
(S. xii. 27, n.) were carried about by
others to excite pity and get alius. See
Pers. i. 88.

306. Sem-orum neela Lieinusjubet,] As
to this man see S. i. 109, 11. z “ Pallante et
Licinis? This man posted a whole regiment
of slaves about his house with buckets
(hamis) for fear of fire. ‘Attonitus' is only
a sti-unger word for ‘ territus‚' he was wild
with sear for his fine things. It is used in
the same way above, xii. 21. As to ‘elee-
trum ’ see v. 38, ‘¹ Heliadum crustas ;'’
‘signis,' viii. 110; ‘ Phrygiaque eolumna,’
above, 893 ‘ebur‚' xi. 123, sqq. ς ‘testu-
dine‚’ vi. 80, 11., xi. 95, n.

308. Dolia nudi Non ardent Cynici :]
He says the Cynie's tub does not take fire.
This is Diogenes. He calls him ‘nudus '
because he wore no tunic. See note on
S. xiii. 122. The ‘dolium' was made of
clay. If any 0110 broke it, 110 could make
another next day, or patch the old oue with
101111. It is not “ a new tub will be made
and the old one turned to some account '’
(Maym), even if the true reading 110 ‘atque '
which Jahn, Hermann, [and Ribbeck]
adopt from P. and other MSS. ‘Atque’
would mean ‘ nay more than that, 110 will
patch up the old one and let it stay?
‘ Aut ' is the reading of most MSS. Either
will do in my opinion.

Alexander-'s interview with Diogenes, and
