Et qui nec Cynicos nec Stoica dogmata legit
A Cynicis tunica. distantia, non Epicurum

Si nullum in terris tam detestabile factum
Ostendis taceo; nec pugnis caedere pectus

Te veto, nec plana faciem contundere palma,

120. Accipe quae cont-ra] He begs him
to accept such consolation as even he, who
professes to be 110 philosopher, never to
have read the dogmas of Cynics or Stoics,
and to be no admirer of Epicurus, may be
able to offer him. The name of the Cynics
was given them in the time of their founder,
Antisthenes, immediately after the death of
Socrates, his tcacher. But the popular idea
of their character is derived more from
Diogenes of Sinope, the crabbed disciple of
Antisthenes. The Stoic school was founded
full three quarters of a century after the
Cyuic by Zeno, who had 111 1115 earlier
studies attached himself to the Cynics‚ but
modified 1115 opinions and gave to the views
of that school a more general and expan-
sive character. But the Stoics too became
more contracted under the successors of
their founder, and 111 the popular notious
of Juvenal’s time, as in our own, there was
not much difference between the two sys-
tems. Juvenal professes to know them
merely by name, and says they only
difl'ered by 3 tunic. The Cynics were
called διπλοείματοι from wearing the cloak
or 1318 which formed their only covering
double, that it might serve as 3 rhed ¹md
111-1111(οί) at 11181011. They wore this rug
(abolla) so that the right shoulder w as
bare, as the Scholiast says, and Ferrarius,
de Re Vest. i. 15. Hor· 100 speaks of the
Cy 1110 35 one “quem duplici panno pa-
tientia velat” (Epp. i. 17 25). They
were also called 1310111311)ἀχίτωνες,νν111011
explains J uveual s meaning. He probably
had not rea-d more of Epicurus' ‘ dogmata '
thau of Antisthenes’ or Zeno’s. But their
character as generally understood was
enough for his purpose, as it would be
under the same circumstances now. Any
of these schools would have blamed Cal-
vinus for his repining, one from contemptu-
ous disrcgard for money aud disbelief of all
honesty‚ the second from professedly 111811οι-

philosophical motives, and the third because
such vexation and all sorts of excitement
only interfered needlessly with the enjoy-
ment of life. The eontrast between the
Cynic and man of pleasure is well described
111 the above epistle of Horace. Epicurus
opened his 5011001 at Athens Β. 0. 306, and
taught there about thirty· six years till his
death. [For‘ et qui '(.v 121) Ribbeck has
lS ( Ul.

1213.. ,despicit κεί-931] ‘Suspicit’ 15 looks
up to. Epicurus, though he advocated 3111-
mal pleasure, was an abstemious liver upon
principle, and fond of gardening : and it was ⁴
in a garden he bought in the middle of
Atheus that 110 taught all the time he lived
there; his successors taught there too, for
he left it to his school. Pliny says he was
the first that introduced gardens in Athens
(H. N. xix. 4). See S. xiv. 319.

‘dubii aegri’ see note on ix. 16:
macies aegri veteris.'' Mr. Mayor is con-
sistent, and says ‘ aegri ’ is used as a sub-
stantive, which he said of ‘ nobilis,' viii. 49,
n. Juvenal says patients in a dangerous
state may apply to great doctors, but his
friend’s disorder is slight and he may trust
to the 111110110110111)7 of a pupil of Philippus,
who represents some small or bungling
practitioner of the day.

126. Si nullum in terris] Juvenal may
or may not have had in mind Stertinius'
words to Damasippus about madness: “ hoc
si erit in te Solo, nil verbi percas quin for-
titer addam '' (Hor. S. ii. 3. 41).

129. claudenda estjanua damno‚] Gran-
gaeus quotes the proverb about shutting the
51311Ιο door after the horse is stolen 3 but it is
nothing to the purpose here. Roman houses
were shut when one of the family died,
as with us; and he says if his friend can
show that the robbery he has suffered is
worse than ever was heard of, he may beat
