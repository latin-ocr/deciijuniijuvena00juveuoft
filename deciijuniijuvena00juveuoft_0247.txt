the {igure of a man of the Red faction
standing in the middle, with a stick in his
right hand and some hay in the left, and
two horses juinping upon him, one on each
side: these are the sire Aquilo and the son
Hirpinus. The inscription on one side is

66. trito ducunt epiredia collo] They
are put to draw with galled neck ‘ epiredia,'
which were carts or harness, it seems un-
certain which. The Scholiast says they are
‘⁸ ornamenta rhedarum aut plaustra ;'' For-
eellini says it is the harness. The word is
noticed by Quintilian (Inst. i. 5. 68) as
compounded of a Greek and a barbarian
word, ‘ rheda ' being aGallic name. ‘Nepos'
is the name of a baker. There were hand-
mills and mills turned by horses, or more
commonly asses, which is the origin of the
term μύλος ὀνικός, which occurs twice in
the N ew Tostament (Matt. xviii. 6. Luke
xvii. 2, where our translation omits ὀνικός).
The MSS. vary between ‘trahunt' and ‘du-
cunt,’ some having the conjunctim), others
not. Most have ‘ducunt :³ many have
‘tritoque ducunt,' the ‘ que' being supposed
necessary and the quantity of less import-
ance. ‘ Trahunt‚' I think, arose out of the
‘que‚’ which is not wanted. Ruperti has
‘tritoque trahunt! . Jahn and Heinrich
‘ trito ducunt? [beg and Ribbeck
have ‘nepotes’ for ‘ Nepotis.']

68. primum aliquid da] ‘Da' means
‘ tell me,’ as in Horace (S. ii. 8. 4, where
see note). “ Da, si grave non est, Quae
prima iratum ventrem placaverit esca ;'’
and virgil, Ecl. i. 19, “sed tamen iste
Deus qui sit da, Tityre, nobis.’' Heinrich
says it means ‘fam' Jahn has adopted an

alteration of Salmasius, ‘ privum ς’ [and
Ribbeck] The reading of the MSS. is no

doubt right. ‘Damus et dedimus’ is a

Sed te censeri laude tuorum,

rcdundancy of speech, Heinrich says3 ‘ we
give and have always given :' it expresses
the heartiness with which such honour is
given where it is due.

71. quem nobis sama superbum Tradit]
‘ivhose nobility gives him to us prond,
puffed up. and full of his relationship to
Nero? Horace uses ‘fama’ in the same
way (S. i. 6. 15, sq.) t

“ ,Iudice quo nosti populo, qui stultus
honores
Saepe dat indignis, qui famae servit in-
Etegtliilget in titulis et imaginibus.''

73. Sensus eommunis] This means a
sense held in common with others. See
note on Horace, S. i. 3. 66, “communi
sensu plane caret‚'’ where Bentley has a
useful note referring to most of the places
where the expression occurs. That sense
which is common property would naturally
escape the exclusives. It implies a sym-
pathy with mankind which the pride of
birth in the nature of the case prevenis, and
also a knowledge of character and of the
value of things only to be got through the
experience of common life and intercourse
with practical minds. In Horace’s instance
this common sense is what the French eall
‘ tact? The man there might be a worthy
man, but he had away of doing things out
of time and place and annoying people by
want of consideration. Here the want of
common sense is shown in a silly ignorancc
of self, and of the worth of that which all
the rest of the world knows is worth nothing
to him. The phrase ‘communis sensns ³
has a variety of applications which are easily
made. The commentators refer to the
Greek expression for it used by Marcus
Antoninus, κοινονοημοσύνη, Salmasius’ ex-
planation of which Heinrich refers to, and
it is given at length in Gifford's note.
[See Gataker’s note on Antoninus, i. 16.
The word there means that the Empero
