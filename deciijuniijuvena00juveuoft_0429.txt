46. rara avis ech] This proverbial way
of speaking occurs twice in Juvenal (S.
vi. 165, n.). The modest repetition ‘si
quid tumen aptius ' is like Horace, “ Quod
spiro et placeo, si placem tuum es t” (v. 28,
n..) ‘Exit’ may bc tal· en si om the pot-
ter’scraft, asin Hor. A. P. 21, “Amphora
coepit Institui; currente rota cur urceus
exit?'’ ‘Metuam' is used as Horace
frequently uses it; “penna metuente
solvi '' (C. ii. 2. 7), “metuentis reddere
soldum'' (S. ii. 5. 65), and elsewhere. It
means ‘to refusc,’ or something of that
sort. The original notion is connected
with fear and shrinking, but that is lost
sight of in these places. “Labra movet
metuens audiri'’ (Hor. Epp. i. 16. 60),
quoted by Jahn, is less to the purpose:
fear is there clearly expressed. ‘ Fibra' is
the lower part of the liver, and is here
equivalent to ‘ jecur,’ the seat of all kinds
of desire and passion, as here the desire of
ralse.
P 48. Sed reoli finemque extremumque]
“But Ι deny that your ‘ Euge,’ ‘belle‚' are
the end and the extreme limit of all that is
right.’' ⁴ Finem' is the end (τέλος) to which
things tend; ‘extremum' is the farthest
point to which one can go in the pursuit of

Romans were numerous: σοφῶς was the
most common. Horace gives three others
, (Α.Ρ. 428), “clamabit enim I'ulcre! bene!
recte !'’ and Martial several more (ii. 27),
“ effecte! graviter! cito! nequiter! euge!
beate !’' ‘ Excute ’ is explained on Hor. S.
i. 3. 35, “denique te ipsum Concute,” and
on Juv. S. vi. 143, “si vcro excutias,
facies non uxor amatur.'' The idea is
taken from the shaking of a suspected
person’s clothes to see 1³he lias nothing
secreted in them. So Pliny (H. N. vii.
36) says of the woman who was allowed

to visit her mother in prison and nursed
her froin her breast, “ a janitore semper
excussa nequid inferret cibi.” (Sec Juv.
iii. 314, n.) The metaphor is followed up
here by ‘⁴ Quid non intus habet ?'' Coni-
pare Cic. in Pisonem, c. 5, ‘⁴ Haec sunt, 0
carnifex, in gremio sepulta consulatus tui.''
“This applanse if scarched will bc found

trash that fine people eompose for the

lebore,’ which is the Greek name for the
same plant. It was a purg-ing medicine
supposed to have much effect in clearing
the brain, and so used in madness, and by
pocts (Pliny, H. N. xxv. 5). ‘ Elegidia’ is
a Greek diminutive not elsewhere used in
Latin. The third syllable is lengthened.
‘ Crudi proceres' are great people who
have not yet digested their dinners. ‘ Dic-
tarunt ’ means that they did not read but
sponted their nonsense extempore (or pre-
tending that it was so) for the parasitos to
admire and the slav e to t· ike down. Horace
says in his Epistle to Augustus‘ ‘Pueri
patresque severi Fronde comas vincti coe-
