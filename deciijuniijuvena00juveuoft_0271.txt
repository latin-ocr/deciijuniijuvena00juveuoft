63. [mprobus es quum poscis-Q ‘ Impro-
bus’ is here importnnate and without
shame, 115 in S. iv. 106. It sometimes 15
used for ‘persevering ' in a good sense, 115
111 Vir-g. Georg. i. 145 t ‘¹ labor onmia vicit
ImprobuS.'' ‘Pensio’ means bere house-
rent. Itis used for any periodical pay·
ment, as rent, interest, ἃς». Hc says his
necessities bid him, with a voice louder
than the Cyclops', ask sor payment.
⁸ Polyphemi lata acies' means Polyphemus
with his big eye. Horace has several such
phrases. See note on S. i. 2. 32: “sen-
tentia dia Catonis.” ‘Crispi jucunda se·
nectus’ (S. iv. 81) is the same sort of
expression. ‘Per quani ’ means ‘by put-
ting out which.'

The roaring of the Cy-
elops was terrible.

“Clamorem immensum tollit, quo pontus
et omnes
Contremuere undae, penitusque exterrita
tellus
Italiae, curvisque immugiit AEtna caver-
nis.’'

This is Virgil‘s description (Aen. iii. 672,
sqq.) imitated from Homer (OdySS. ix.
395). The interpretation of F. Didot,
quoted with approval by Ruperti, is too
absurd to be repeated. A great deal of
nonsense has been written about Polyphe-
mus' eye, which they who 0110058 may read
in Holyday’s note.

67. Quid aqam bruma spirante Ι] Hc
says he shall have to buy another slave,

and then feed and clothe two instead of
one; then what is he to say to them when
1118 winter winds begin to blow and their
shoulders and feet are bare? must 118 tell
thern to bear it as they could, and wait for
the return of the ‘cicada‚’ that is till the
warni weather 8011185 back ἲ ‘ Decembri ’
is an adjective, as Horace uses it, S. ii. 7.
4: “ libertate Decembri.''

70. Verum, ut ‹Ii-vsimulaed “Suppose
that you say nothing about and pass by my
other services, at how 11111011 110 you esti·
mate this Ρ” He theu goes on to say that
but for him his master’s wife would have
left him in disgust and he would have been
ebildless. ‘ Ista’ means that requcst ot'
yours. ‘Saepe’ belongs to ‘fugient.eln,'
and means that she had repeatedly avoided
her husband. ‘ Puella ' is used for a wife,
as in Horace, C. iii. 14. 10: “Vos o pueri,
ct puellae Jam virum expertae.’' As to
‘dominae' (v. 78) in the same sense, sec
note on Hor. C. ii. 12. 13. He says the
woman had gone so far as to break her
marriage tablets (S. ii. 119, n.: “ Signatae
tabulae ’'), and was on the point of signing
others, that is 5118 had divorced her hus-
band for inability to discharge a husbund's
duty, and was on the point of marrying
another man. [Ribbeck has removed vv.
79, 80 from the text, and placed them at
the bottom of his page with the reading.r
‘ servavit,' which Jahn also 11115. In ν. 83
Ribbeck has ‘qnod’ in place of ‘ vel-³]
