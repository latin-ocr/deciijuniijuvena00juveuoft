D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Sed jumenta vocant et sol inclinat; eundum est.
Nam mihi commota jam dudum mulio virga

Innuit.

Ergo vale nostri memor, et quoties te

Roma tuo refici properantem reddet Aquino,

Me quoque ad Helvinam Cererem vestramque Dianam
Satirarum eg0, ni pudet illas,

Converte a Cumis.

Adjutor gelidos veniam caligatus in agros.

my power to add many other reasons), but

319. Roma tuo refici] ‘ Reddet refici' is
not a prose construction, which would be
‘reddet reficiendum' or ‘ nt reficiaris?
Aquinum, which from this verse is gene-
rally called J uvenal’s birth—place, still keeps
its name (Aquino). It was situated on the
Via Latina in Latium, not far from the
borders of Campania. Part of the walls
still remainS, and ruins of various build-
ings: among them are three templeS, which
may or may not be those of Ceres and
Diana here mentioned. From coins of
Aquinum still existing, which bear the
head of Minerva, it would seem that the
town was under her protection. Why
Ceres is called here Helvina or Elvina,
which name she bears nowhere else, is
quite uncertain. The Scholiast's notion that
the name is derived from the Helvii, a
people of Gaul, is not worth any thing.
The various derivations that have been sur-
mised will be found in Forcellini. One of
Henninius’ MSS. had ‘ad Eleusinam,’
which Ruperti approveS, but as it will not
scan, he proposes putting ‘ad ' before ‘ Ce-
rerem! The s would be a tempting ad-
dition to ‘ Eluinam,’ and but for ‘ ad' no
doubt more copyists would have put it in,
and the e would soon follow.⁴

321. m' pudet illas‚] ‘ If they are not
ashamed of mc3’ that is, if your satires
will condescend to accept my help, 1 will
put on my boots and come to you. The
‘ caligae ’ were thick hob-nailed shoes worn
by soldiers. Here it appears the name
was given to very thick shoeS, such as
a man would wear in the country. The
notion of the commentators about his going
to Juvenal dressed like a soldier, to help
him to attack the follies of the age, is won-
derful. According to Gifford‚ he says he will

“Come well equipped to wage in angry
rhymes

Fierce war with you on follies and on
c1·in1es.'’

“ Here by a beautiful allusion a satirist is
considered as a eoxnbatant against vice.''
(Owen.) “Multis symbolis instructus et
quasi armatus,'¹ says Ruperti. “I will
come to do service in the ranks in your
great contest.'' (Mayor.) And nearly all
ring the changes on the same idea from
Britannicus downwards. Though Aquinum
was 011 a plain below the Apennines‚ Um-
bricius speaks of its fields as cool. There
was plenty of water iu the neighbourhood,
and the breezes from the mountains would
make it eooler than some places. [Rib-
beck quotes a Neapolitan inscription from
Mommsen, in which one J unius J uvenalis
dedicated something (sacrum vovit dedi-
cavit) to a divinity, of whose name only
the last two letters (RI) are preserved in
the inscription. He concludes that the
complete name is ‘Cerei-i,’ and that this
Ceres is the Helvina Ceres of the Satirist.
It appears that the inscription is after the
time of Vespasian, for the dedicator de-
scribes himself as ‘Flamen Divi Vespa-
siani.' This mutilated inscription also ‹le-
signates the dedicator as in some way con-
nected with COH . . . DELMATARVM,
in the capacity of tribune or praefect as
Ribbeck assumes. The inference is that
he who made the dedication had served in
the army, which must be admitted ; and the
further inference is made that he was the
Satirist Juvenal, which is by no means
certain. No person, observes Ribbeck, is
described as ‘ caligatus ³ except ‘miles in-
feriorum equestri militia ordinum.’ He
also says, ‘ etiam adjutore-m velut tribuni
militare munus esse docent inscriptiones.'
Accordingly, he concludes, ‘satis festive
tribuno vel praefecto cohortis quasi ad-
jutor, equiti caligatus ad scribendas satiras
officium profiteri fingitur Umbricius.' If
this argument proves that Juvenal was a
military officer, it proves also that Um-
bricius was a common soldier, a conclusion
which does not appear consistent with the
general tenour of the satire]
