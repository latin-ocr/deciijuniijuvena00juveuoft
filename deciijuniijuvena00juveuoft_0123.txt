SATIRA ΙΙΙ.

Ergo non aliter poterit dormire?

Quibusdam

Somnum rixa facit ε scd quamvis improbus annis
Atque mero fervens cavet hunc quem coccina laena
Vitari jubet ct comitum long-issimus ordo,

Multum praeterea flammarum et a'efnca lampas ι

Μο quem Luna solet deducere vel breve lumen
Candelae, cujus dispenso et tempero filum,

Contemnit.

Si rixa est ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum.

Stat contra starique jubet 5 parcre necesse cst ;

Nam quid agas, quum te furiosus cogat et idem
Fortior? “ I'nde venis ?'’ exclamat: “ cujus aceto,
Cujus conche tumes? quis tecum sectile porrum
Sutor et elixi vervecis labra comedit?

Nil mihi respondes? Aut dic aut accipe calcem.

the wicked, and go not in the way of evil
men. For they sleep not, except they have
done mischief3 and their rest is taken away,
unless they cause some to fallss’ The pic-
ture of Achilles seems to have been a fa-
vour-ite illustration. Seneca introduces it
(de Tranq. An. ii.): “qualis ille Home-
ricus Achilles est modo pronus modo su-
pinus in varios habitus se ipse componens.''
281. Eryo non aliter] Heinecke and
Ruperti propose to banish this line [and
Ribbeck also]. I 500 no objection to it.
There is no need to talk of Juvenal inter-
rupting Umbricius 3 the man goes on
speaking himself, ‘ Can’t they then sleep,
you may well say, without all this? Nay,
some sleep all the better for a quarrel.'
‘ Somnum facit’ occurs above, v. 242. As
to ‘improbus,' which means here ‘ hot-
headed‚' and has a great variety of mean-
ings elsewhere, the reader may consult
Forcellini and Note on Hor. C. iii. 24. 62.
283. quem coccina laena] The scarlet
‘laena‚’ worn by the rich, dyed with the
{coccumss cochineal‚ was one of the va-
rieties of ‘lacernae,' a thick woollen cloak
thr-own over the toga. The youth may
be the worse for wine‚but he can distinguish
between a rich man and a poor, who only

it fmm flaring away, as he had no lantern
to put it iu. Johnson has paraphrased this
part of the satire shortly, but very well:

“Some fiery fop with new commission vain,
Who sleeps on brambles till he kills his
man ς

“Poor me he fights if that be fighting

(Drydeu.)

The Scholiast quotes Terence (Adelph.
ii. 2. 5): “ Ego vapulando ille verberando
usque ambo defessi sumus.''

292. Unde venis ?] This was the com-
mon salutation of civility, as here of rude-
ness. See Hor. S. i. 9. 62: ‘⁴ Unde venis
et quo tendis ?'' S. ii. 4. 1: “Unde et
quo Catius ? '¹

cujus aceto, Cujus conche tumes ?]
‘ With whose vinegar and beans have you
been filling your belly ? with what cobbler
have you been eating leeks and greasy
sheep's head ?' This is his way of asking
where the poor man has been dining. As to
‘sectile porrum’ see Forcellini, who ex-
plains that the leek was either ‘sectivum
or ¹ capitatum 3' the first when it was eut
