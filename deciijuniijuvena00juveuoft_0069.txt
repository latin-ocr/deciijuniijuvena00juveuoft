Antiquis una comedunt patrimonia mensa.
Nullus jam parasitus crit: sed quis ferat istas

Luxuriae sordes? Quanta est gula quae sibi totos

Ponit apros, animal propter convivia natum !
Poena tamen praesens, quum tu deponis amictus
Turgidus ct crudum pavonem in balnea portas.
Hinc subitae mortes atque intestata senectus.

It nova nec tristis per cunctas fabula coenas :

Ducitur iratis plaudendum funus amicis.
Nil erit ulterius quod nostris moribus addat
Posteritas; eadem cupient facientque minores;

Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit.

Totos pande sinus.

man's dinner may read the ninth chapter
of Becker’s Gallus, and the description of
Trimalchio’s dinner by Petronius, on which
Becker’s fiction is founded. [These two
verses, 137, 138, are ejected from the text
by Ribbeck, and indeed they do not seem
to be genuine ς at least they convey no
clear meaning, and they interrupt the con-
text.

132). Nullusjam parasitus erit :] ‘ We
shall soon have no parasitos ; but who shall
bear to see this selfish gluttony of yours Ρ ’
He addi-esses the man. ‘ Luxuriae sordes '
means avarice and luxury combined. ‘ Po-
nere’ is the word used for putting dishes
on the table. See Hor. S. ii. 4. 14, n., and
elsewhere. At large banquets a boar served
up whole, and sometimes stuffed with all
manner of forced meat and rich things, was
usually the chief dish. (Hor. S. ii. 3. 234,
n., and 8. 6, 11.) Grangaeus says Juvenal
has taken ‘ animal propter convivia natum’
from Varro, de Re Rust. ii. 4: “Suillum
pecus donatum ab natura dicunt ad epul-
andum.'’ Juvenal means more than Varro
did. He says it is so big as only to be
meant to‘be eaten when several are collec-
ted at a feast. He might have said the
same of the peacock. ‘ Natum' is used like
‘ Natis in usum laetitiae scyphis' (Hor. C. i.
27. 1). For ‘ferat' some MSS. have ‘feret :'
either will do. Heinrich has the future.

142. Poena tamen praesen8,] ‘ But the

and his hard meat undigested‚ he gets a fit
of apoplexy which puts an end to him. The
news gete about from one house to another,

and his friends, angry at missing the lega-
cies they expected, are glad to hear of his
death? As he made no will his property
would go to his ‘heredes’ The peacock first
came into fashion in Cicero's time. (Hor.
S. ii. 2. 21, n.) The common practice of
bathing immediately aster meals, though in
hot baths, might well lead to sudden deaths
and to frequent intestacy, as Juvenal ex-
presses it. See Persius, S. iii. 98, sqq..
where there are some powerful lines on this
subject. ‘ Ducere funus ' is one of the many
applications of that verb, of which a great
variety will be found in Horace. [Ribbeck
has ‘ Et nova nec tm'stis, &c.' with no stop
after ‘ senectus ' and ‘ coenas.’]

149. Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit]
“All vice is at its height '' (Stapylton). “All
vice is at its zeuith ’³ (Gifford). “All vice
is at its pitch-pole ’³ (whatever that may bc)
is Holyday's version. Τ118 notion is, that
vice is at a point from which it ean climb
no higher, and that the age is ou the brink
osaprecipice‚ and likely to be ruined through
its vices. The stone was still rolling in
Horace’s days:

“ Damnosa quid non imminuit dies Ρ
Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit
Nos nequiores, mox (laturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem .'’

C. iii. 6, fin.

Rigalti quotes Velleius (lib. ii. 10) ε “adeo
mature a rectis iu vitia, a vitiis in prava, a
pravis in praecipitia pervenitur.’'

—Utere velis, Totos pande sinum] He
addresses his Muse as a ship‚ and bids her
set all san. But he supposes one to ask
