SATIRA Ι. 7

Et cito rapturus de nobilitate comesa

Quod superest ,- quem Massa timet, quem munere palpat 35
Carus et a trepido Thymele summissa Latin05

Quum te summoveant qui testamenta merentur
Noctibus, in caelum quos evehit optima summi

Nunc via processus, vetulae vesica beatae?

Unciolam Proculeius habet, sed Gillo deuncem,

40

Partes quisque suas ad mensuram inguinis heres.
Accipiat sane mercedem sang-uinis, et sic

Palleat ut nudis pressit qui calcibus anguem,
Aut Lugdunensem rhetor dicturus ad amm.

A.1>. 93 (Tac. Agr. -15); and though con-
demned it seemsthathe e<caped punishment,
for he became oue of the most notorious
informers in Domitian’s time. Carus Met-
ti‘us was another of the same sort, of whom
Tacitus says, that at the time of Agricola's
death (Aa). 93), “ una adhuc victoria Carus
Mettius‚’' he had only signalized himself by
, one great victory in his profession ; which
means that he afterwards became highly
distinguished. Martial mentions him pro-
verbially (xii. 25). The words ‘ delator ami-
ci ' are so like S. iii. 116, that it might be
supposed Egnatius Celer was meant, as the
Scholiast suggests ς but he was dead. See
note on that place. Thymele and Latinus
were an actress and actor, to whom Domi-
tian was partial ; wherefore Martial begs him
to look on his books as kindly as he looked
at these two persons on the stage (i. 5).
Latinus is often mentioned by Martial, who
wrote an epitaph for him, and flattered Do-
mitian through him, as he (lid through his
favourites generally. He is mentioned by
name below, vi. 44, and alluded to in viii.
197, in conjunction with the same ThJ-mele.
The Scholiast here and on iv. 53, on the
authority of Marius Maximus, who wrote
the lives of some of the emperors, says that
Latinus was an influentia] informer. These
informers were all afraid of the great man
of their craft, and did what they could to
make friends with him. Latinus lent him
Thymele, who was either his mistress or his
wife. This is the Scholiast’s explanation.
Heinrich supposes some scene is referred to,
in a fax-ee acted by these people He isobliged
to change ‘et' into ‘ut’ to support this ex·
planation.

37. Quum te summoveant] “ De heredi-
tate justa tanquam de via ; proprie enim
‘summovere ’ verbum lictoru1n.’' This is
Grangaeus' note ς and it is true as respeets
the lictors. (Hor. C. ii. 16. 10, n.) But

there is nothing in the text about an ‘here-
‹lit;·s.’ Juvenal means ‘when meu elbow
you out of the way who have got rich by
scandalous means?

38. summi Nunc via processch,] ‘ Pro-
cessus' means advanccment5 and ‘ summi
processus’ advancement tothe highest place.
So ovid (Trist. iv. 5. 25): “Haec tua pro-
cessus habeat fortuna perenneS.’' Rigault
quotes an inscription, “ OB srlffl PROCES-
svs Ἐπὶ-εἶ’ It was by these means that
Otho got into favour with Nero (Sueton.
Otho, c. 2), “libertinam aulicam gratiosam
quo efficacius coleret ctiam diligere simula-
vit, quamvis anum ac paene decrepitam:
per hanc insinuatus Neroni facile summum
inter amicos locum tenuit.”

40. Unciolam Proculeius habet] Procu-
leius has a twelfth part of the estate lest
him, aud Gillo eleven-twclfths : the first is
‘ heres ex uncia; ’ the second ‘ heres ex
deunce.’ The divisions of the ‘as' repre-
sented the portions of the estate devised to
euch ‘heres’ (Hor. S. ii. 5. 53, n. ἦα).
The men are unknown. ‘ Unciola' does not
occur elsewhere. It does not mean, as Ru-
perti says, ‘less than an uncia ς’ but ‘a
poor uncia? as we say.

42. Accipiat sane] There is contempt
in this: “ Let him take it with all my
heart.’'

43. pressit qui calcibus anyuem‚] Hein-
rich thinks this is an allusion to Homer
(11. iii. 33):

ὡς ὅτε τίς τε δράκοντα ἰδὼν παλίνορσος
ἀπέστη

ἄψ ’,Ξ ἀνεχώρησεν, ὦχρός τέ μιν εἷλε παρ-
ει ς.

44. Aut Luydunensmn] Suetonius relates
(vit. Calig. c. 20) that Caligula instituted
gamos, ‘ludos miscellos' (see S. xi. 20, n.)
nt Lugdunum (Lyon), where there was nn
altar, dedicated to Augustus on the day that
