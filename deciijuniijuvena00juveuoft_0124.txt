Ede ubi consistas: in qua te quaero proseucha

D. JUNII J UVENALIS

P),

Dicere si temptes aliquid tacitusve recedas,
Tantundem est ; feriunt pariter ,- vadimonia deinde

Irati faciunt.

Libertas pauperis hacc est ε
Pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat,

300

Ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.

Nee tamen haee tantum metuas: nam qui spoliet te
Non deerit, clausis domibus postquam omnis ubique
Fixa catenatae siluit compago tabernae.

Interdum et ferro subitus grassator agit rem,

305

Armato quoties tutae custode tenentur
Et Pomptina palus et Gallinaria pinus:

the other when it was allowed to grew to
a head.

296. Ede ubi consistas :] He treats him
as a J ew beggar, and asks him where hc
posts himself to beg, in what ‘proseucha ³
he must look for him if he wants to find
him. Schleusner (sub verb.) describes a
‘ proseucha’ as an oratory‚ a buildingerected
for the use of those towns where there was
no synagogne, outside the walls by a stream
or the sea-side, for the benefit of ablution.
It was used like the synagogue for reading
the law and prayer three times a day. In
the Acts of the Apostles (xvi. 13) the writer
says τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἐξήλθομεν
ἔξω τῆς πόλεως (Ρ1111111111) παρὰ ποταμὸν,
οῧ ἐνομίζετο προσευχὴ εἶναι, 1111(1 there
προσευχὴ 15 generally understood to be a
building of this sort. In the Gospel by
St. Luke (vi. 12) our Saviour is said to
have passed the night ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ
Θεοῦ, where also Whitby and other com-
mentators take προσευχὴ for a house of
prayer. Josephus in his own life, c. 54,
says, συνάγονται πάντες εἷς τὴν προσευχὴν,
μέγιστον οἴκημα πολὺν ὄχλον ἐπιδέξασθαι
δυνάμενον Α5 to the present tense ‘quaero '
see iv. 130.

298. vadimonia deinde] After frighten-
ing the poor man out of his senses, they
affect to 110 the injured parties, and (10011110
they will have the law of him. As ‘to ‘ va-
dimonia‚' see above, v. 213. The whole of
this scene is very amusing, and the last
verse most entertaining of all. He only
prays as a particular favour to be allowed
to go home with a few of 1115 teeth. The
state of the streets at night, even during
the. time of Augustus, was verydisgraceful.
Tacitus (Anu. xiii. 25) describes it in the
time of Nero, who himself set the example
of night-brawling, which was followed by
many under the shelter of his name. The

same tricks were praetised by Otho and
other emperors.

305. subitus grassator αῃὶέ rem‚] ‘ Gras-
sator' means ‘a highway-rol)ber;' and it
appears from this place that the Pomptine
Marshes and the forest of Gallinaria were
infested by handitti. Suetonius says of
Augustus : ‘¹ Grassatorcs dispositis per op-
portuna loca stationibus inhibuit '' (c. 32).
He took great pains to put them down, and
so did Tiberius, as Suetonius tells ns (c. 37);
and it would seem from Juvenal's words
that their plan of having military posts in
the different places the robbers frequented
was still pnrsued. Driven out from the
above haunts, they took up their abode in
the city, where they carried on their trade
(which is the meaning· of ‘ agit rem ³),
breaking into houses and murdering the
inhabitants. ‘Subitus' seems to mean that
you start up from sleep, and find one of these
men by your bed ready to cut your throat.

“ In vain, these dangers past, yourdoors you
Aifdolsibpe the balmy blessings of repose;
Crnel with guilt, and daring with despair,
The midnight murderer bursts the faith-
Iniezzsdelsatllie sacred hour of silent rest,
And leaves unseen a dagger in your

breast.” (Johnson.)

That this gives J uvenal’s meaning I have
no doubt. But some take it to be that at
night, when the houses and shops are shut,
you are liable to be attacked by robbers in
the streets.

307. Et Pomptina palus et Gallinaria
pinus :] The Pomptinus Ager was a plain in
Latium about twenty-two miles in length,
extending from Appii Forum to Terracina,
and from eight to ten miles in depth on the
west, separated from the sea by a low
