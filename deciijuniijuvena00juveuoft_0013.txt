nothing to recommcnd him. He has borrowed without aeknow-
ledgment fromRuperti ; so at least that editor says. His remarks
are very feeble. He has added in a separate volume notes more
valuable than his own by the two brothers Valesii, written at the
end of the seventeenth century, but never before published entire.
He also had access to a large number of MSS. in the imperial
library at Paris. How he used them his references are too general
to enable the reader to judge. The only English edition 1 have had
occasion to notice is one by Mr. Mayor (Cambridge, 1853), intended
for the use of schools; thc chief feature of which is a large compila-
tion, from various sources, of references to other authors, classical
and ecclesiastieal‚ some given as quotations, but most by reference
to the places in which the passages are to be found. The object of
this is said to be “to rescue certain authors from undeserved con-
tempt.” The authors mea-nt are those later than the Augustan
age. Whether they are held in undeserved contempt, or whether
this commentary has helped to rescue them, I do not know. Mr.
Mayor does not approve of Heinrich, and from the nature of his
own commentary it was not to be expected that he would. His
text professes to be that of Jahn, “ except in orthography and
punctuation.” In his interpretation when he has an opportunity
he follows the judgment of Madvig, in whose Opuscula there are
two essays in which some passages of Juvenal are commented upon.
With all respect for that eminent scholar, I do not think the inter-
pretation of Juvenal was quite in his way. I have mentioned his
opinion in several places. The names of GrangaeuS‚ Britannicus,
Henninius, and other seholars of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, will be found in these notes. Their commentaries, in
part or entire, are collected in a thick quarto volume, published at
Leyden by Henninius in 1695, which book Ruperti calls “ indi-
gestam vanae speciosaeque doctrinae farraginem, rudemque rerum
inutilium molem.’' It contains much that is wrong and a great deal
that is good, and Ruperti need not have despised it. The edition of
Lubinus (Hanover‚ 1603> Ι have had by me. Ruperti looks upon
him as “ verbosus nugator.'' He was a learned man and the friend
of learned men, and often understood Juvenal where Ruperti did not.
