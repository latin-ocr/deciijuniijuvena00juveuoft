SATIRA XIV.

Et cana monstrante gula.

Quum septimus annus

817

Transierit puero, nondum omni dente renato,
Barbatos licet admoveas mille inde mag-istros,
Hinc totidem, cupiet lauto coenare paratu
Semper et a magnanon degenerare culina.

Mitem animum et mores modicis erroribus aequos

15

Praecipit, atque animas servorum et corpora nostra
hIateria constare putat paribusque elementis,

An saevire docet Rutilus, qui gaudet acerbo
Plagarum strepitu et nullam Sirena flagellis

Comparat, Antiphates trepidi Laris ac Polyphemus,

far asI know. ‘Nebulone parente’ should
be taken with ‘monst1·ante,' a profligato
father and an old man‘s throat showing
the way, that is by example, as in v. 3.

10. Quum septimus annus] Children for
the first seven years were‘ infantes) ‘Pue-
ritia ’ was not a legal term, and was 100501)ν
employed, though it was commonly used
for those ‘impuberes' who were not ‘in-
fantes,’ that is from seven to fourteen, or
when the ‘toga virilis' was taken. The
MSS. have ‘puero‚’ except R, which has
the accusative. The copyist may have
found ‘puero,' and supplied or found the
common mark of the accusative over the ‘0’
(ὀ). But Ι do not think Juvenal meant it,
or that ‘ puero ’ should bc joined with
‘admoveas‚’ as Ruperti suggests. ‘ Barba-
tos’ is equivalent to ‘ wisc and Icarned.'
See notes on Hor. S. ii. 3. 16, 35. [Rib-
beck has ‘ puerum.']

13. lauto coenare paratu] The common
word is ‘apparatus‚' as in Horace, C. i. 38,
“Persicos odi puer apparatus? and Cic.
Cat. ii. 9, where the participle is used,
“ conviviis apparatis.” Elsewhere Cicero
says “licuit ornare et apparare convivium '’
(Verr. ii. 4. 20).

[Aster- v. 14 Ribbeck inserts vv. 73-85.]

15. Mitem animum] He asks whether
Rutilus (any passionate savage master)
teaehes his son the value of a gentle temper
and a calm habit that seldom goes wrong,
and that slaves are, body and soul, made
of the same material as ourselves (‘ nostra
materia')‚ or to act the ruffian like him-
self, when he sets him the example of
flogging thern and delights in the sound of
the lash. Horace says of himself, thanks
to his father's example and training,

“— ego sanus ab 11115
Ρο1111010111 quaecunque ferunt ς mediocri-
bus et quis

20

Ignoscas vitiis teneor.''
(S. i. 4. 129, sqq.)
And elsewhere he gives his good father the
credit, “si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis
Mendosa est natura, alioqui recta” (6. 65).
His father taught him chiefly by example,
his own and others'. Hc was his “ custos
incorruptissimus‚” and kept him “ ab omui
Nou solum facto verum opprobrio quoque
turpi.'’
“—- mi satis est si

Traditum ab antiquis morem servare
tuamque

Dum custodis eges vitam famamque
tueri

(s. i. 4.116.)

This father's conduct and language were
what Juvenal wished to see. The woman
in S. vi. thought it was an extravagant
absurdity that a slave should be called a
man: “O demens, ita servus homo est?''
(v. 222.) The Sirens have been mentioned
before, S. ix. 150, n., and ‘ flagellum ’ in vi.
479, n.

20. Antiphates trepidi Laris] He says
he is the Antiphates and Polyphemus of
his trembling household. The first was
king of the giant Laestrygones in Sicily,
who sunk Ulysses' ships and ate up one of
his men (Odyss. x. 80—132). As to ‘ tor-
tor ' see S. vi. 480, n. Cicero speaks with
horror of “ ignes candentesque laminae
caeterique eruciatus'’ being applied to a
Roman citizen (In Verr. ii. 5. 63). They
were commonly applied to slaves to obtain
evidence, and so Cynthia's ghost calls on
Propertius to torture her slave on sus-
picion of poisoning her wine: “ Lygdamus
uratur, candescat lamina, vernae’' (iv. 7.
35). See Lueretius iii. 1030. This poor
111-01011 of Rutilus' is supposed to be put to
this torture for thc loss of a couple of
towcls. There were no legal limits to the

Incolumem possum.’'
