Egypt. ἰ. 440). He says Anubis is reprc-
sented in Egyptian sculptures with a
jackal’s and not a dog‘s head. They do
not differ much.

The Artemis represented hy Bubastis
may not have been that goddess who was
most commonly worshipped in Greci-e, and
who was the goddess among other things of
the ehase. Mr. Blakesley (on Herod. ii.
156) says she was not, but the Ephesian
Artemis, so that Juvenal could say what
he does with strict truth. It is probable
Juvenal did not think about Bubastis and
Artemis. He only thought of his point,
that the Egyptians worshipped the beast
and not the goddess it belonged to. Ja-
blonski (Panth. Aeg. iii. 3, vol. ii. p. 58,
quoted by Ruperti) is at unneeessary pains
to account for J uvenal’s assertion.

9. Porrum et caepe nefas] See below,
v. 174. Horace alludes sometimes to the
supposed notions of Pythagoras in con-
nexion with vegetables‚ and particularly in
that verse “ Verum seu pisces seu porrum
et caepe trucidas '’ in his letter to Iccius
(Epp. i. 12. 21). The doctrines of Pytha—
goras are supposed to have been in part de-
rived from the Egyptians whose objection
to eating leeks and onions is mentioned
by several ancient authors, Plutarch,
followed by Gellius (xx. 8), gives as the
reason that they grow at the waning of
the moon, and wither when she waxcs.
Gellius speaks of this fancy as confined to
the :nhabitants of Pelusium in the Delta.

10. quibus haec naseuntur] ⁴ Haec' is
ironieaL ‘ such gods as these! Above (xiii.
103) we have ‘ solet his ignoscere,' ‘he is
wont to pax-don such offences as these.’ In
v. 65 below we have ¹ hunc lapidem,' ‘ such
a stone as this? Horace (S. i. 6. 89) says
‘⁴ Nil me poeniteat patris hujus‚'’ ‘such a
father as this?

11. Lanatis animalibus] According to

Herodotus (ii. 42) the inhabitants of the
'l'heban nome abstained from cating sheep
though they ate goats, while the opposite
practice prevailed at Mendes (in the Delta),
where they ate sheep and abstained from
goats. The cannihalism imputed to the
Egyptians is fabulons, though Diodorus
says that on the occasion of a great
fiunine human fiesh was caten (see v. 93,
ss q.).

l15. Alc-[nom] When Ulysses left the
island of Calypso (Ogygia) by himself on a
rast which she taught him to build, he was
carried to the island Scheria, inhabited by
the Phaeacians‚ whose king was Alcinous
(Odyss v. 386, sqq) He was hospitably
entertained by the king, and at a banquet
told his adventures (odyss. ix.). See
Horace, Epp. i. 2. 28. Juvenal says that
when Ulysses told wonderful stoi-ies (such
as he is going to tell) to Alcinous and his
party, though some took them in with asto-
nishment, a few who had not drunk very
deep no doubt treated him as an impostor,
and would have handled him roughly for
thinking so meauly of their uuderstandingS.
The Greeks used ἴσως as Juvenal uses ‘ for-
tasse’ for a thing that is pretty certain.
¹ Moverat’ seems to mean that while Alei-
nous was listening open-mouthed‚ others
had long made up their miuds that the man
was imposing on them. The word ‘ areta-
logus ’ occurs in the Scholiasts on Horace,
S. i. 1. 120 (where see note), in connexion
with Crispinus, who they say was an ‘ are-
talogus! It appears froin Suetonius (Octav.
c. 74.) that these were jesters employed by
the rich to amusc them at their meals with
mock philosophical discussions· Casaubon
says the name was coined at Rome.

17. Ilunc abici!,] [In Ovid, l‘ont. 2. 3.
37, there is “ Turpe putas abici, quia sit
miserandus, amicum;” but the reading
‘abigi’ of some editions is better. In the
