SATI ΒΛ lx.

Ilaec soli commissa tibi celare memento,
Et tacitus nostras intra te lige querelas;

Nam res mortifera est inimicus pumice levis.

Qui modo secretum commiserat ardet et odit,

Tanquam prodiderim quidquid scio.

1311511ἱ aperire caput, candelam apponere valvis

Non dubitat.

Nec contemnas aut despicias, quod
His opibus nunquam cara est annona veneni.

Ergo occulta teges, ut curia Martis Athenis.
O Corydon, Corydon, secretum divitis ullum

Esse putas ’.Ρ

Servi ut taceant, jumenta loquentur
Et canis et postes et marmora.
Vela teg-ant rimas, junge ostia , tollite lumen

ἤγοντο δὲ καὶ ἕτεροι δύο κακοῦργοι σὺν
αὐτῷ ἀναιρεθῆναι (Luke xxiii. 32), there
were led two others who were malefactors
to be crucified with him. But the man
uses words which may be taken against
himself.

95. inimicus pumice levisn] He begs 1115
friend not to repeat what he has said lest
it should come round to his master3 for
such lewd persons are spiteful and de:ully
enemies. As to ‘pumice levis' see note
ou S. viii. 16. The man’s alarin 15 amusing,
and so is the serious 1111511·οι- of 1115 friend,
who keeps up 1115 fears.

96. Qui modo secretum commiserat] He
says that when a man has made another
the depositary of his secret iniquities, he
begins to hate him immediately, and to
think he has betrayed him: accordingly
he is ready to cut the other to pieces‚ to
break his head or set fire to 1115 1101150
(‘valvis,' 1115 door, xiii. 146, n.)‚ and (he
adds) we must not, oven—look the fact that
these rich people (‘opibus' is used for
‘divitibusss the thing for the person) will
give any thing sor poison to get rid of
un enemy. Horace 11115 “Vilis amicorum
est annona bonis ubi quid deest '' (Epp. i.
12. 24), 111111 that sort of expression seems
to have been proverbial. Umbricius says
of the Greek interlopers who got into finni-
lies, “Scire volunt secreta domus atque
inde timeri ” (S. iii. 113). [Ribbeck omits
Luce, contemnas aut despicias quod his opi-

10i. ut curia Marti-⁹ Athenis] The
Areopagus wus 0111101ὶὴ ἄνω βουλὴ aster the
constitution of Solon, to distinguis-h it from

the couneil of 500, which was called simply
βουλή. Hence Juvenal calls it ‘euria.'
Before Solon’s time it was only a court of

justice. He gave it certain politieal and

other functions, and made it a deliberative
assembly. The proceedings were. conduct-cd
with closed deors, and the members were
swern to sccrecy.

102. O Corydon, Cory(lon,] The friend
will not let Naevolus off so easily, but calls
him a foolish fellow for thinking that any
thing a rich man does ean be kept secret.
Suppose the servants hold their tongue‚
the very beasts, door-posts, stones will cry
out. This was a proverbial way of speaking.
Ovid (Met. ii. 696) has “ Tutus eas3 lapis
iste prius tna furta loquetur.'’ The 00111-
mentators on Luke xix. 40, ἐὰν οὗτοι σιω-
πήσωσιν οἶ λίθοι κεκράξονται, quote other
exampleS. ‘⁶ The stone shall cry out of the
wall, and the beam out of the timber shall
answer it,'' is 0111· translation of the pro-
phet Habakkuk (ii. 11). Juvenal imitatos
Virgil’s “O Corydon, Corydon, quae te
dementia cepit Ρ ” (Ecl. ii. 69.)

105. tollite lumen] Some MSS. and old
editions have ‘tollito,' and Ruperti and
Achaiutre have that form. But 115 Heinrich
observes, the change of number is not uu-
usual, and the probability is that ‘ tollito ' is
a copyist’s correction. The MSS. have all
‘clamant’ or ‘clament‚' except 1’.‚ which has
‘ taceant) Henninius and others have fol-
lowed Pithoeus in adopting this reading.
