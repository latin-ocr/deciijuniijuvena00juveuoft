Exspuit5 Albani veteris pretiosa- senectus

Displicet ; ostendas melius, densissima ruga

Cogitur in frontem velut acri duc-ta Falerno.
Nocte brevem si sorte indulsit cura soporem

Et toto versata toro jam membra quiescunt,

Continuo ternplum et violati numinis aras

Et, quod praecipuis mentem sudoribus urget,

220

Te videt in somnis 3 tua sacra et major imago
Humana turbat pavidum cogitque fateri.

Hi sunt qui trepidant ct ad omnia fulgura pallent,
Quum tonat, exanimes primo quoque murmure caeli 3

Non quasi fortuitus nec ventorum rabie sed

Iratus cadat in terras et judicet ignis.
Illa nihil nocuit, cura graviore timetur

“ petite trying vainly to grind the meat that

mocks them. Sick persons and those in
grief know what this means. Ovid makes
{gssg3sfribe his jealonsy so (Hcroid. xvi.

“ Lumina demitto cum te tenet arctius
Cildgic'it et invito lentus in ore cibus.''

— sed vina misellus] ‘ Sed ' means ‘ not
only so, but even his wine the poor wretch
cannot swallow? See S. xiv. 117. Hein-
rich says it means ‘scd tamen? but yet
though hisjaws are dry he cannot swallow
his wine. ‘ Setina' for ‘ sed vina’ has been
invented by ‘¹ Cl. Herel '' as Ruperti calls
him, approving his conjecture but not
adopting it. Jahn, Hermann, [and Rib-
beck] are bolder, and do so against all the
MSS. and the Scholiast. [Jahn and Rib-
beck put a large stop after‘ cessat? and a
comma after ‘cibo‚’ and thus spoil the
passage] Ruperti says ‘'sed is ‘h. 1. inep-
tum? Ι think not. The Alban wine is
mentioued in S. v. 33. Falernian wine
was strong and required keeping. Horace
therefore makes the epicure say

“Aufidius forti miscebat mella Falerno,
Meudose, quoniam vacuis committere ve·
Nillnrsiisi lene decet.''

(S. ii. 4. 24, n.)

He says elsewhere (C. i. 27. 9):

“Vultis severi me quoque sumere
Partem Falerni. ⁹’'

and again (C. ii. 11. 18).

 

quis puer ocius
Restinguet ardentis Falerni
Pocula praetereunte l) mpha. 9⁹2

218. jam membra quiescunss‘] Jam' is
‘at length)

220. mente-m sudoribus πῃπῇ] This is
a strong and expressive word for ‘ terrori-
bus,' but not so used elsewhere 1 believe.
‘ Sacra ’ is explained by ‘major humana?
The old poets would render it “thy reli-
gious ghost.’' ¹ Iinago' is the unsubstan-
tial body (εἴδωλον) of the dead. See Hor.
C. i. 24. 15, n. Here it is used for a super-
natural vision of the living.

225. Non quasifortuilus] ‘ Fortuitus' is
pronounced as a word of three syllables.
Horace makes the ‘ i ' long in “ Nec fortui-
tum spernere caespitem ” (C. ii. 15. 17).
Forcellini however thinks it is common.
The authorities except these two places
are inferior writers. The ancients be-
lieved that thunderbolts‚ lightning, and
meteors either came from the stars with
messages to mankind or arose from acci-
dental physicnl causes, which Pliny de-
scribes (H. N. ii. 43). These latter they
called ‘bruta fulmina’ or ‘fortuita,’ the
others ‘fatidica.' ⁴ Judicet’ means ‘it
comesto judge and punish men! [Rib—
beck has ⁶ vindicet ignia ' See Servius ad
Aen. iv. 209; vi. 179. Η. Valesius, quoted
by Jahn, suggested‘ ut vindicet.. ']

227. Illa nihil nocuit,]‘ Suppose that has
done him no harm he is all the more
anxious, waiting for the next storm, as if
it was only kept off by this short lull!
