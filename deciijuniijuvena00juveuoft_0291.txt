SATIRA X.

Eloquio sed uterque perit orator ; utrumque

Largus et exundans leto dedit ingenii fons.

Ingenio manus est et cervix caesa, nec unquam 120
Sanguine causidici maduerunt rostra pusilli.

“ O fortunatam natam mc Consule Romam !'’

Antoni gladios potuit contemnere, si sic

Omnia dixisset.

Ridenda poemata malo
Quam te conspicuae, divina Philippica, famae,
Volveris a prima quae proxima.

Saevus et illum

Exitus eripuit, quem mirabantur Athenae
Torrentem et pleni moderantem fraena theatri.
Dis ille adversis genitus fatoque sinistro,

118. uterque perit oraton] As to ‘perit '
see S. vi. 559, n.

120. Inyem'o manus est et cervix caestu]
This refers to the death of Cicero, ac. 43.
He was proscribed by the triumvirs, over-
taken as he was trying to escape by sol-
diers, who cut off his head and hands and
carried them to M. Antonius, who ordered
them to be nailed ‘co the rostra. If he
had been a humble ‘causidicus’ this would
not have happened, Juvenal says, Florus
(iv. 6. 5) describes the feelings of the peo-
ple on this occasion : “ Romae capita cac-
sorum proponere in rostris jam usitatum
erat: verum sic quoque civitas lacrimas
tenere non potuit quum recisum Ciceronis
caput in illis suis rostris videretur, nec
aliter ad videndum eum quam solebat ad
audiendum concurreretur.” ‘ Causidicus ³ is
opposed to ‘oraton’ which and ‘patronus’
are the proper titles for au advocate of the
higher order (see S. i. 32, n.). ‘ Ingenio '
is put for the man, as ‘officia ' above (v.
45). Cicero reached the highest point of
his popularity, and delivered his last ten
speeches against M. Antonius the year he

122. Ο fortunatam] This verse occurred
probably iu a poem in three books that
Cicero wrote on his own times (Ad Fam. i.
9), or else iu that on his consulship, from
which there is a long extract in his book
De Divinatione (i. 11). This verse is
quoted by Quintilian (Inst. ix. 45 xi. 1).
Juvenal says if he had never said a better
thing than that he might have snapped
his fingers at Antonius, quoting his own
words (Phil. ii. 46): “Contempsi Catilinae
gladios, non pertimescam tuos.” He adds,
he would rather have been the author of his
ridiculous poetry than of that Philippic
which he calls divine, famouS, and so forth.

This speech was written in September, 1³.c.
44, as a rejoinder to Antonius' reply to the
first Philippic. Cicero did not attend the
meeting of the Senate at which Antonius
spoke, and though this speech professes to
be an extemporaneous reply, it never was
delivered, but written in the country, nor
did Cicero venture to publish it imme-
diately. ‘ Volveris’ means ⁶ you are read ς’
¹ a prima proxima' is a way of expressing
the second.

126. illum Est-itus* eriptam] After the
death of Alexander Demosthenes used all
his eloquence to produce a general rising
of the Greek states against Antipater, the
successor to the Macedonian division of
Alexander's kingdom, and succeeded. But
the resistance of the Greeks was not effec-
tual, and rather than fall into the hands
of Antipater Demosthenes poisoned him-
self, 13.c. 322.

128. moderantem fraena theatri] 'rba
popular assemblies (ἐκκλησίαι) were beldin
the Pnyx, a space of ground near the Areio-
pagus, till the buildiag of the theatre of
Dionysus in the Lenaea, about Rc. 340,
after which the assemblies were commonly
held in the theatre. It was finished in De-
mosthenes’ time, and he must often have
spoken there (ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τῇ ἐν Διο-
νύσου c. Meidiam, Νόμος, p. 518). Juvenal
likes the compar-ison of a speaker to a tor-
rent, and for popular oratory a vehement
flow of words is the most effective gift. See
above, vv. 9 and 119. S. iii. 74: ‘⁴ Promp-
tus et Isaeo torrentior.'’

129. Dis ille adversis] This is a common
way of speaking3 otherwise the verse might
be said to be imitated from Persius (iv. 27):
“ Hunc Dis iratis genioque sinistro.'' De-
mosthenes' father was a man of property,
and died when his son was seven years old.
