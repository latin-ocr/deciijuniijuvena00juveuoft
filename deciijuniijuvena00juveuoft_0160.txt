110 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

from long peace: luxury broods over us, more pestilent than arms, to avenge the
conquered world. Lust has been rampant ever since the poverty of Rome departed 3
'twas this brought Greeee amougst us. 'Twas money gave us foreign habits, and
broke down the age with self-indulgmice. For what care lust and drunkenness
combined? See how 1110 wantons 511001 111 modesty, and shame her very altars.
We all know the good goddess’ sceret rites ; how her mad votam-ies, (lrunk with wine
111111 11111510, rave, whirl their 100115, and eall upon Priapus. No acting then, but
wantonness at which the blood of age might warin again. They call for meu—and
would that sacred rites were free from wickedness like this—but every one has heard
of him who in old days stole in where all that’s male must 111110 115 head: then who
(lared pour contempt on sacred things P Now we've a Clodius for every altar.

V. 346. “ Theu put a loek upon the women.'' Aye, but who shall wateh the watchers ?
They are the first to fall. Highest and lowest, she who tramps the streets and she
who rides 111 1111015, 1111 are frail.

V. 352. To 500 1110 games Ogulnia hires her clothes and every thing, for all her fortune’s
gone to smooth-eheeked 1111110105. They’re poor, but have 110 care for that3 and
squander what a thrifty husband saveS, and think that money grows like trees. They
never think how much their pleasures cost.

V. 379. Suppose she’s fond of 11111510, there’s no singer but she eorrupts him ; her
favourite's harp is always 111 her hand: she kisses it, and thinks ’tis him she holds in
her embrace. Some noble dame, they say, with meal and wine asked all the gods
whether her Pollio's harp might hope to win the prize. What more could she if her
husband 01· her children were a-dying? What, J auus, dost thou answer such
inquiries? Ye have not much to do then in the skies.

V. 398. But let her be a singer rather than a masculine bold gossip, who talks among
the 01110015, knows all the 1101115, public· and private, waits at the gates to pick up the
first tidings from abroad, and then distributos lies concerning floods, and earthquakes,
and 50 forth to every woman that she meets in the town.

V. 412. But she’s more bearable than savage women who flog their poorer neighbours,
and if a dog barks fly into a rage, and beat the beast and his owner. She goes at
night to the bath, keeps her guests waiting for their dinner, then 0011105 1101110 heated
and thirsty, drinks off two pints and vomits them again to get an appetite. The
husband veils 1115 eyes from the sickening sight.

V. 434. But she is worse who when she goes to dinner begins forthwith commending
Virgil, comparing him with Homer. The learned hold their tongues, even the women
1110115, while she clacks on like bells or basins when they’re struck. No 0110 need help
the moon with trumpet or with cymbals; she can deliver her without your aid. Your
learned woman ought to wear short 11111105, sacrifice to Silvanus, go and bathe with the
111011. Marry 110 woman who ean talk, and argue, and knows all knowledge. I hate
your woman rhetorician who speaks by rnle, and recolleets old verses Ι 11ον01· heard of,
and corrects the barbarisms of her friends. Pray let a husband make mistakes some-
times.

V. 457. But most 1111110111111110 of all is she who decks herself abroad with jewels3 at
home her face is all besmeared with bread3 she washes for her lover. What does
she care for looking well at home? For paramours she buys her nard and all the
perfumes of the East, softens her skin with asses’ milk, and takes the covering off that
hides her beauty. A thing made up with drugs and poultices, what eall ye ic, a face
or sore Ρ

V. 474. What (10 they do by day? If they get up 01055, woe to the poor waiting-girl,
the. toilette-men are stripped, the Liburniam smarts, one with the horrible scourge,
the other with the whip. Some keep the exeeutioners in fee. And while the lash
goes on shc's dressing, talking with her friends, looking at her gown, or reading her
