D. JUNII JUVENALIS

One was properly called ‘nobilis' if any
of his ancestors had scrved in a curule
office; but no one, according to Juvenal's
definition and common usage, could be
called ‘ generosus ' who was ‘ indignus ge-
nere 3’ or if he were it would be like calling
a dwarf Atlas, an Aethiop a swan, a de-
formed girl Europa, or a lazy, mangy dog
a noble beast of the forest (see below,
v. 57).

32. Nanmn cujiwdam] In the later
times of the republic and afterwards it was
the fashion for rich persons to have idiots,
dwarfs, and other deformities in their 11011595
to amuse them. The former were called
‘moriones’ or ¹ fatui,' the latter ‘ nani,' ‘ pu-
miliones,' or ‘ pumili.' They were of either
sex. Propertius iv. 8. 41 :

“Nanus et ipse suos breviter concretus in
artus
J actabat truncas ad cava buxa manus.”

Suetonius tells us of Augustus that he
shrunk from this sort of people : “Pumilos
atque distortos et omnes generis ejusdcm ut
ludibria naturae malique ominis abhorre-
baffi (c. 83, where see Casaubon's note).
Tiberius and Domitian (c. 4) each, ac-
cording to Suetonius, had a person of
this sort to attend upon them, and they
were able to do serious mischief. The
practice 1135 been continued to very late
times, and is not unknown now, especially
in the East. ‘ Pravam ' is ‘crooked‚' and
‘extortam' is ‘twisted out of shape‚' so
there is not much difference, which led
probably to the substitution of ‘par-vam?
which is in most MSS. Jahn has it, and
Ruperti meant to have it, it would seem
by his notes. But ‘parvam' is feeble.
He means a deformity, a ‘ nana!

38. ne tu sis Creticus aut Camerinus]
Creticus was an agnomen of the Caecilii

Metelli first given to Q. Caecilius Metellus,
who conducted and brought to a successful
conclusion the war with Crete, B-C. 68—66‚
for which he triumphed B.C. 62. The
Caecilia gens was plebeian, but much dis-
tinguished. The name of Creticus has been
used before (S. ii. 67). Camerinus was
the name of a good old family of the patri-
cian gens Sulpicia. Juvenal, after saying
that things are called by their opposites,
advises his friend not to be called a Creti-
cus 01- Camerinus, for the inference would
be that he was something very low. Two
conjectures have been offered for the pur-
pose of meuding the text, which does not,
Ι think, want mending. ‘ Ne tu sic Creti-
cus ' is that of H. Junius, adopted by Jahn
and stamped with Ruperti’s frequent “ uon
male.'' [Ribbeck also has ς5193] It does
not require much taste to see that Juvenal
did not write ‘ sic? Heinrich thinks some
alteration necessary, and reads ‘ne hic tu
sis,' which, Ι think, is not much better
than the other. He explains it “ne talis
sis, ne hoc sensu sis Creticus‚” and com-
pares Horace (Epp. i. 6. 40), “Ne fueris
hic tu,'' and (Epp. i. 15. 42) “Nimirum
hic ego sum ;'’ 111 both which places 1 take
‘hic ’ to be an adverb, and the construction
to bc like the Greek ἐνταῦθ’ εἰμές but
whether that be so or not ‘hic ’ is out
of place here and clumsy. All that J uve-
nal means is that the man had better
decline than affect these fine names, what-
ever others might do, for there is empha-
sis in ⁴ tu?

39. Rubelli Planta] C. Rubellius Plau-
tus was descended through his mother
J ulia from Tiberius whose son Drusus was
Julia’s father. He incurret] the jealousy
of Nero, who caused him to be put to
death, A.D. 62. Juvenal says he was in-
flated with his pedigree, but Tacitus gives
