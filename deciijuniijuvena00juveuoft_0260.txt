D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Simia, 1160 serpens unUS, nec culeus unus.
Par Agamemnonidae crimen ς
Dissimilem ;
Patris erat caesi media inter pocula, scd nec

, Electrae jugulo se polluit aut Spartani

Sanguine conjugii 3
Miscuit, in scena nunquam cantavit Orestes 3
Troica non scripsit. Quid enim Verginius armis
Debuit ulcisci magis, aut cum Vindice Galba?
Quid Nero tam saeva crudaque tyrannide fecit ⁵?

sed causa sacit rem 215
quippe ille deis auctoribus ultor
nullis aconita propinquiS

Haec opera atque hae sunt generosi Principis artes,

nestra to death, bnt he did it by the order
of Apollo, to revenge his father's murder.
He did not murder his sister Electra, nor
his wife Hermione (daughter of Menelaus
and Helen), nor poison his relations, Be-
sides Britannicus Nero poisoned his father’s
sister Domitia for her money.

217. media inter poeula‚] The place
and manner of Agamemnon's murder by
his wife, as well as her motives, are dif-
ferently stated. Juvenal follows a story
which says she killed him over his wine.
So Agamemnon's ghost tells Ulysses in
Hades (Hom. Odyss. 111. 408) ι

ἄλλοί μοι Αἴγισθος τεύξας θάνατόν τε μόρον
τε,

ἔκτα σὺν οὐλομένῃ ἀλόχῳ, οἶκόνδε καλέσ-
σας,

δειπνίσσας, ὥς τίς τε κατέκτανε βοῦν ἐπὶ

φάτνῃ.

219. Sanffltz‘ne eonjugiffi] This is used
for ‘(·0njugis‚’ like “remigium vitiosum
Ithacensis Ulixei ’' (Hor. Epp. i. 6. 63) and
other words which are common enough.
Suetonius (c. 20) tells 115 Nero went upon
the stage first at Naples, where. he appeared
several times. Servius on Aen. v. 370
refers to Nero's poem on the taking of
Troy, and the Scholiast on Lucan iii. 261
quotes three verses, which he says are
Nero's, and which are supposed to be part
of that poeni. They are not worth re-
peating. Dion Cassius (62. 29) mentions
the poem, which Suetonius says Nero re-
cited w hile Rome w 15 1111111111ς,“1“1001 mg out
fr0m a tow er and admiring the beauty of
the flames (6. 38; lacit. Ann. xv. 39).

221. Quid enim Veryim'ecs armis] He
asks which of all Nero’s crimes so called for
punishment> as his having written this dull
poem. Ruperti, by way ofgetting rid of the

point, says Juvenal does not mean the dul-
ness of the poem so much as the wickedness
of Nero in causing Rome to be burnt that
he might see what'l'roylooked like in flames.
L. Verginius Rufus, Julius Vindex, and
Galba, were governors of Upper Germany,
Gallia, and Hispania Tarraconensis under
Nero. Vindex rebelled, and offered to get
the empire for Galba, but lost his life in a
battle with Verginius who was sent against
him, but who afterwards was mainly in—
strumenta] iu establishing Galba, though
he never took up arms (111-661117 against
Nero. Juvenal speaks of them all as if
they were leagued against Nero, and it is
true that Verginius and Vindex were in
comnmnication just before the battle in
which the latter lost his life. In v. 223
Jahn has adopted Madvig's conjecture
‘ qu0d‚' joining the verse on with the 0116
before. [Ribbeck has the same] ‘ What
is there that Nero did which so deserved
punishment at the hands of Verginius,
Vindex, and Galba ἴθ’ All the MSS. have
‘quid‚’ and 1 think it may stand, though
the sentence is not complete. V. 223 is
supplemental to the sentence before:
‘ What is there that Verginius should
rather have punished? What that
Nero did in all his reign so savage and
bloodv ,θ’

223. {cmi saera crudaque tyrannide] The
reign of Nero 11* as from ΑΔ). 54— 68. It
116 gan in mu r·,dei and 11 as brought to an
1111111111 end through the hatrcd created by
1,· 15 sa .v age conduct. The praetor-ian troops
11 erc induced 111 their commander N ymphi-
dius Sabinus to 1 volt in favour of y(Jralba,
and Nero being entirely deserted by sol·
diers and friends destroyed himself.

224. generosi Principis] ‘ Generosi' is
used ironieally. See note on v. 30.
