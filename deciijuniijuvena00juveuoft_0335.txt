SATIRA XII.

285

Vestibus extentis ct, quod superaverat unum,

Velo prora suo.

Jam deficientibus Austris
Spes vitae cum sole redit : tum gratus Iulo,

70

Atque novercali sedes praelata Lavino,
Conspicitur sublimis apex, cui candida nomen
Scrofa dedit, lactis Phrygibus mirabile sumen,
Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis.

Tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora molcs

Tyrrhenamque Pharon porrectaque brachia rursum,
Quae pelago occurrunt medio longeque relinquunt
Italiam—non sic igitur mirabere portus

Quos natura dedit—sed trunca puppe magister

Interiora petit Baianae pervia cymbae

80

Tuti stagna sinus, gaudent ubi vertice raso
Garrula securi narrare pericula nautae.

70. tum graius Iulo,] When the sun
rose they made out the heights os Alba.
Where the Trojans lauded in Latium
Aeneas built a town and called it Lavi-
nium after his wife Lavinia. Thirty
years afterwards when the population of
this town increascd, his son Iulus or
Ascanius left it to his stepmother, and
founded Alba Longa. To the spot hc was
directed by a white sow with a litter of
thirty pigs, such a sight as the Trojans
had never seen: S. vi. 177: “Scrofa
Niobe fecundior alba.” The highest point
of the group of the Alban hius, to which
the Romans gave exclusively the name
Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo), and
from the foot of which runs the ridge on
which Alba Longa appears to have been
built, is 3000 feet above the level of the
sea, and a conspicuous object to ships ap-
proaching the coast.

75. Tandem intrat positas] The port
of Rome was for some centuries Ostia,
which was originally built at the mouth
of the Tiber, but gradually became less
accessible from the sea through the de-
posit of soil brought down by the river.
In consequence of this the Emperor Clau-
dius in the year ΑΔ). 42 caused a basin
to be dug two miles to the north, which
was connected with the river by means
of a. canal. Here ships of large size were
able to ride, the basin being protectcd
by two moles which ran out into the sca,
and between them there was a break-
water with a lighthouse upon it. This
basin was called Portus Augusti (Dion
Cass. 60, 11. Suet. Claudius, 20). Trajan

increased and improved this artificial
harbour (which Juvenal says you would
admire more than any natural one) by
the addition of an inner basin, as the
Scholiast on this place mentions. This
basin the pilot of Catullus' ship made for.
It was such that a small boat might enter
and lic there in safety, such a boat as
plicd upon the Lacus Lucrinus, by Baiae.
The above account explains the text.
‘ porrectaque brachia rursum ' means that
the moles were cui-ved outwards beyond
the breakwater and took a bend inwards
behind it. ‘Non sic igitur' is ‘not so
much then,' such being the character of
the work. ‘ Sed ’ means that though the
outer basin was safe, the pilot thought
it better with his disabled ship to go into
the other. (Dict. Geog.‚ Ostia.) Gibbon
(c. xxxi.)‚ describing the second siege of
Rome by the Goths, A-D. 409, gives an
account of this port, which he calls “ one
of the boldest and most stupendous works
of Roman magnificence.'' Juvenal calls
the brcakwater Tyrrhenam Pharon after
the Alexandrian Pharos (vi. 83, n.), on
which Ptoleiny Philadelphus built his
lighthouse. From this lighthouses in
general got the name Pharos.

This allusion to Trajan’s basin shows
that the satire was not written before his
time.

81. gaudent ubi vertice raso] Sailors
saved from a wrcck commonly cut off their
hair as n thank offering to some god. Ru-
perti refers to the authorities on the sub-
ject. [‘gaudent ibi’ Pfs, Jahn and
Ribbeck]
