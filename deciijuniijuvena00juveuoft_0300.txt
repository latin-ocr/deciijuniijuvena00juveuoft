Antilochi barbam ardentem3

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

quum quaerit ab omni,

Quisquis adest socius, cur haec in tempora duret,

Quod facinus dignum tam longo admiserit aevo,

255

Haec eadem Peleus, raptum quum luget Achillem,
Atque alius, eui sas Ithacum lug-ere natantem.
Incolumi Troja Priamus venisset ad umbras
Assaraci magnis solemnibus, Hectore funus

Portante ac reliquis fratrum cervicibus inter

260

Iliadum lacrimas, ut primos edere planctus
Cassandra inciperet scissaque Polyxena palla,
Si foret exstinctus diverso tempore, quo non
Coeperat audaces Paris aedificare carinas.

Longa dies igitur quid contulit? omnia vidit

265

Eversa et flammis Asiam ferroque cadentem.
Tunc miles tremulus posita tulit arma tiara

Et ruit ante aram summi J ovis, ut vetulus bos,
Qui domini cultris tenue et miserabile collum

Praebet ab ingrato jam fastiditus aratro.

Exitus ille utcunque hominis 3 sed torva canino
Latravit rictu quae post hunc vixerat uxor.
Festino ad nostros et regem transeo Ponti

256. Haeo eadem Peleus,] See Pindar,
P3th. iv. ‘Alius’ is Laertes, father of
Ul3·s ses, whose w·ande1i11gs and tlials are
suinmed up in a few lines by Propertius.
The grief of Laertes afte1 the departure of
Telemachus in search of his father is
spoken of by Homer, 011555. xvi. 138.
Aster the return of Ul3‘sses, Laertes re-
newed his youth with the help of Athena
(011555. xxiv. 204, sqq.). ‘Natanteni ’ means
⁶ afloat? See Prop. iv. 12. 32 (Paley).

258. ad umbras Assaraci] Assaracus
xva· great— uncle of Priam. Juvenal means
if Priam had gone to his fathers before the
siege of Tr⁷‚03 he would have had a fine
funeral, and his sons 55 ould haxe carried
him to 1)111·131; the xxomen xxould haxe
wept for him, and his daughters xxould
haxe led the wailing (ἧρξάν κε γόοιο, a
common Homeric expression). Paris' bold
ships are the fleet iu 55 hich he first sailed
to Sparta and then carried off Helen.
Hor. C. i. 15. 1:

‘⁸ Pastor cum traheret per freta navibus
Idaeis Helenam perfidus hospitam.''

The death of Ρ113111 killed 1)5 Ρ5 rrhus at
the alt-11 of J oxe is related b3 ἶ irgil‚ Aen.

ii. 506, sq J ux enal sa3s he went to the
alt ar to be slain like an old ox who has
done his xxork at the plough and is now
counted fit 01115 for sacrifice.

271. Exitus ille uteunque homini-x ·] His
death hoxx ex er 55 35 the death of a man3
55 hei-eas his xxa'fe Hecuba xxas changed into
11 dog. That 55 35 one legend referred to
111 Euiipides' play that bears her name
(5.1265),311(1 related b3 Ovid (Met. xiii.
423 sqq..) Cicero mentions the same
(Tusc. Qu. iii. 26):‘ ‘Hecubam autem
putant propter animi acerbitatem quandam
et rabiem fingi in canem esse conversam.''
By surviving her husband she lived to be a
slave, to witness the death of two more
children, Polyxena and Polydorus, and to
die a dog.

273. reyem transeo Ponti] ‘ Transeo' is
not here used as in iii. 114 and vi. 602. I'n
means ‘I pass over, say nothing about.'
He is referring to Mithridates VI. Eupa-
tor, the great- ὅ’3115015315 of the Romans,
55110 aster a 51011115 life came to a bad end
about the age of sex ent3. The stor3 of
Solou' 5 311555 er to Croesus is familiar.
