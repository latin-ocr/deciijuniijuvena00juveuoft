D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Crimine persona est? Mullum sex millibus emit, 15
Aequantem sane paribus sestertia libris,

Ut perhibent qui de magnis majora loquuntur.

Consilium laudo artificis, si munere tanto

Praecipuam in tabulis ceram senis abstulit orbi.

Est ratio ulterior magnae si misit amicae, 20
Quae vehitur clauso latis specularibus antro.

Nil talc exspectes: emit sibi.
Quae miser et frugi non fecit Apicius.

Multa videmus
Hoc tu

Succinctus patria quondam, Crispine, papyro.

Hoc pretium squamae !

15. persona] The Scholiast says, ‘non
homo sed persona,' ‘not a man but a mask.'
That is, he was a hypocrite, an actor.
But this is not the meaning of ‘ persona ³
here. “In the law writers ‘ personae ³ sig-
nifies persons, that is, human beings as
invested with a certain character by which
they become objcets of law, as opposed to
things which are not persom, but either
material things, as objects of property, or
legal facts, as contracts and the like.'’ (Long
on Cic. de Am. c. 1.) This explains ‘per-
sona ’ here. He was ‘foedior omni Crimine,’
no charge could express his wickedncss.

Mullum sex millibus emit,] A mullet or
harbel of six pounds was uuusually large.
Two pounds was the smallest size Martial
thought should be scrved on a handsome
dish, and it was not often larger than that.
(Hor. S. ii. 2. 34, n.) The price paid sor
this was equivalent to 46l. 173. 6d. of our
money, taking the sestertium (thousand
sesterces) at 7l. 16³. 301„ which was its
value at this time. Juvenal admits this
was probably a fabulous price ; but Pliny
tells of one that eost 8000 sesterces (H. N.
ix. 17). The purchaser was one Asinius
Celer, in the reign of Caligula. Macrobius
mentions the same purchase‚ but gives
7 OOO sesterces as the price. Pliny adds that
the contemplation of this transaction leads
0118 to think of those “ qui in conquestione
luxus coquos emi singulos pluris quam
equos quiritabant.” And he goes on, “At
nunc coqui triumphorum pretiis parantur
et coquorum pisces ;'' which Juvenal per-
haps remembered when he wrote “potuit
fortasse minoris Piscator quam piscis emi.''

19. Praecipuam in tabulis ceram] This
is cquivalent to being declared the old
man's heres. A will was usually contained
in three tablets (prima, secunda, and ima
cera or tabula), in the two first of which
were entered the names of the heredes,

Potuit fortasse minoris 25

and in the third those of the ‘substituti,'
who took in the event of any heres being
disqualified‚ ἃς. (Hor. S. ii. 5. 53, n.)
As to ‘ orbi,' sec above, iii. 129, 11.

20. Est ratio ulterior] There is another
way of accounting for it, or another excuse,
supposing he sent it to some great lady who
was fond of him, and who went about in
her ‘sella' with closed doors, but large
windows that she could look out of and be
seen through. She might affect propriety
by shutting up her chair, but she would
have her windows such that she could see
what was going on and be recognized by
her gallants. As to ‘ specularia,' see iii. 268, n.

23. Quae miser et frugi non feeit Api-
cius] M. Fabius Apicius (as he is called

by Dion Cass. 57. 19), whose name has been ¹

proverbial for good living from the time of
Tiberius, when he lived, is here called
‘miser et frugi' by way of comparison
with Crispinus. After spending an enor-
mous fortune on eating, drinking, and his
lustS, he hanged himself. As to ‘frugi‚'
see Hor. S. ii. 7. 57, n.

24. papyro] This corresponds with what
he calleci him before, “ pars Niliacae plebis
—verna Canopi ’' (i. 26). Of the coarser

kind of papyrus (called ‘emporetica’)‚which ·,

was not used for writing, various articles
were made according to Pliny (H. N. xiii.
11) : ‘fitexunt e libro vela, tegetesque, nec
non et vestem, etiam stragulam, ac funes.”
In such coarse garments, tucked up as the
manner of slaves was (Hor. S.ii.8.10,n.)‚he
says Crispinus used to appear in formerdayS.

25. Hoc pretium squamae J] This is the
reading of nearly all the MSS. P. and the
Scholiast have ‘hoc pretio squamae,' which
Ruperti adopts after Henninius and the
Aldine aud the Stephens' editions. Jahn
has ‘hoc pretio squamam‚' without autho-
rity3 [and Ribbeck also.]
