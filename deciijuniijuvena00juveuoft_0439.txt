SATIRA ΙΙ.

INTRODL'CTION.

Tms Satire is nearly free from difficulty. It is nddressed to one Macrinus on hisbirth-
day, and Persius is led to contrast the prayers his friend, an honest inan, will otl'er on
that day with those of the generality of men, who, while openly they appear to pray for a
good understanding aud a good report, in private usk for the gratification of their meancst
desim, sacrific-ing their flocks in the hope the gods will increase theni, and in their in-
fntuated love of gold offen-ing gold to the gOdS, and driving out the siinplicity of the old
temple service, judging divine tastes by those of human corruption. T he moral is that of
Horaoe’s address ω the rustic Phidyle, that he who brings to the altar clean hands and an
honest hau-t may offer the humblest sacrifice and it will be accepted.

The Satire may be read with pleasure and some instruction. There is nothing forced or
unnatural in the language. The illustmtions are not numerous, and the connexion of
the parts is easily followed. Above all, the lessou is not out of date, and as long as God
and Mammon continue to be worshipped together, the imposture of hollow and selfish
prayer will continue too. It is one of the inconsistencies of the human mind to acknow-
ledge the power of God by invoking it to the assistance of its own wickedness, which it
must be the first purpose of that power, if it exists, to punish. It has been said persever-
ingly by the commentators and translators, and Addison has laid it down as a fact in the
Spectator, No. 207, that the ideas in this Satire are taken from the Dialogue falsely
ascribed to Plato, and called “Alcibiades Secundus.'’ 1 have looked through that spuri-
ous production, and can see no thought or trace of expression that Persius need be sup·
posed to have taken from that souree; and whether he ever read the Dialogue may be
doubtful. He had suggestion enough close at hand, in the book he studied most atten-
tively—the men and women about him—to have enabled him to write as much as he
pleased about hypocrisy, whether it took the form of prayer or any other; and every
time we imagine him borrowing from writers rather than from real life, we degrade him
into a position he certainly does not deserve, that of an imitator and mere rhetorician.
This remark obviously doae not apply to a case like that in S. iv. 3 where for the sake
of illustrating a general truth, which is the subject of the satire, a scene is taken

from Plato.
ARGUMENT.

Set down a white mark for this day, Macrinus, and pour libations to your Genius. You
do not need to take the gods apart and buy their favour, as most of our great men
do ; for 'tis not all can venture open prayer, banishing whispers from our temples.
They've common prayers for strangers' ears, but mutter to themselves—‘ Oh that

my uncle would depart this life? ‘Kind Hercules, grant a treasure may turn up
beneath my plough? ‘ Would my ward’s name were blotted from the will : he's
scrofulous and bilious.’ ‘Nerius is burying his third wife.’ To offer prayers like
these without offence you dip your head in the Tiber twice or thrice, and wash away
the night’s debauch.

V. 17. Now tellme—'tis not much—are you prepared to place Jove above—whom Ρ-
why. Staius say, an uprightb man as any. Go, ask of Staius what you ask of Jove—
how would he cry, ‘ Ο Jupiter !’ and shall not Jove cry out, ¹ O Jupiter !'
