Omnibus ad podium spectantibus.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

His licet ipsum

Admovcas cujus tunc munere retia misit.

Esse aliquos manes et subterranea regna,

Et contum ct Stygio ranas in gurgite nigras, 150
Atque una transire vadum tot millia cumba.

Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum aere lavantur.

Sed tu vera puta.

Curius quid sentit et ambo

in the war with Hannibal, was called
Cunctator.

147.0mnibus ad podium spectantibus]
These were all men of station, who had a
place to themselves between the ‘ podium ’
or wall which ran round the arena, and the

Quid Styga, quid tenebras, quid nomina
vana timetis,

M atericm vatum falsique piacula mundi ?''

(Met. xv. 152, sqq.)

Juvenal probably spoke the opinion of most

ordinary seats which rose to the top of of his contemporaries. As to ‘manes' the

the amphitheatre. (Hor. Epp. i. 1. 6, n.)
‘ Ipsum ’ means the ¹ editor ludorum‚’ the
person who gave the show, and who sat on
a high seat wit-hin the ‘ podiun1‚' called the
‘ editoris tribunal.' Here probably is meant
the emperor himself, whose throne was
called ‘ suggestus' or ‘cubiculum.' If it
was Domitian, the man who was of nobler
birth than all the families just named would
certainly be nobler than he, for his father
Vespasian was the son of a man of obscure
birth in the town of Reate in the Sabine
country. This use of ‘ admovere ¹ for
‘adjungere' is not noticed by Forcellini.
As to ‘ retia misit,’ see note above, v. 143.

149. Esse aliquos manes] One MS. has
‘ aliquid,' on which authority Ruperti adopts
it. It is more likely, perhaps, that one
copyist should have invented ‘aliquid ³ than
that all the rest should have fallen into an
error in ‘ aliquos.' The former is the more
plausible reading, particularly as Propertius
had written “Sunt aliquid Manes, letum non
omnia finit'’ (iv. 7. 1), and Ovid (Met. vi.
543) “ Si numina Divum sunt aliquid.''
Persius (v. 152) has “ cinis et Manes et fa-
bula fies‚'’ which he has imitated from Ho-
race (C. i. 4. 16), “ Jam te premet nox
fabulaeque Manes‚'’ where see note. Lu-
cretius, the exponent of Epicurean doctrine,
says ι

“Cerberus et Furiae jam vero et lucis
egestas
Tartarus horriferos eructans faucibus aes-
tus,

Qui neque sunt usquam nec possunt esse
profect0.’' (iii. 1024.)

Ovid makes Pythagoras say :

“ O genu? attonitum gelidae formidine
mor is,

spirits of the good, see note on Hor. Epp.
ii. 1. 138.

150. Et contum] P. has ‘pontum,' and
the Scholiast has ‘pontum’ by an over-
sight, for he quotes Yirgil (Aen. vi. 302) :
“Ipse ratem conto subigit velisque rni-
nistrat,’' where also he writes ‘ponta' It is
strange that sensible editors like Grangaeus
aud Henninius should adopt this word,
which has no sense here. One MS. of no
character has ‘cantum,’ which Ruperti
rather prefers, but does not adopt. [Rib-
beck has ‘ Cocytum et Stygio' &c.]

152. nisi qui nondum aere [uvantum]
Except those who are too young to go to
the baths, where the ordinary price for
bathing was a quadrans, or about half a
fartfflng of our money. See vi. 447, and
Hor. S. i. 3. 137 : “ dum tu quadrante lava-
tum Rex ibis,'' where see note, and also
Becker’s Gallus, Exc. on the Baths. “ Unde
datur quadrans ?'’ (Martial iii. 30.)

153. Sed 121 ver-aptata] ‘But in yourcase
only suppose it all to be true? As to
Curius, see above, v. 3. The form ‘Sci-
piada' is used by Horace (S. ii. 1. 17),
“ Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius‚’' and by
Virgil (Georg. ii. 170), “Scipiadas duros
bello‚” and (Aen. vi. 843) “ duo fulmina
belli Scipiadas, cladem Libyae, parvoque
potentem Fabricium,” where, as here, the
two Scipiones are associated with C. Fa-
bricius LuscinuS, the opponent of Pyrrhus
and contemporary of Curius. Camillus is
M. Furius the conqueror of the Gauls, and
the deliverer of Rome. ‘Cremerae legio ’
are the Fabii mentioned above (on v. 145).
The whole gens, consisting of 306 persons,
with the consul Kaeso at their head, having
quarrelled with the patricians, quitted
Rome, and founded a settlement on the
Cremera, a stream or torrent a few miles
