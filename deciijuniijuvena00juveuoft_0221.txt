SATIRA VII.

171

Cujus et alveolos et laenam pignerat Atreus,
Non habet infelix Numitor quod mittat amico,-

Quintillae quod donet habet ‚

· nec defuit illi

Unde emeret multa pascendum carne leonem
Jam domitum : constat leviori bellua sumptu
Nimirum, et. capiunt plus intestina poetae.
Contentus fama jaceat Lucanus in hortis

Marmoreis: at Serrano tenuique Saleio

80

Gloria quantalibet quid erit, si gloria tantum est?
Curritur ad vocem jucundam et carmen amicae
Thebaidos, laetam fecit quum Statius Urbem
Promisitque diem. Tanta dulcedine captos

Affieit ille animos tantaque libidine vulgi

85

Auditur: sed quum fregit subsellia versu
Esurit, intactam Paridi nisi vendat Agaven.

is some small play-writer of the day. He
says we expect such a man as this, who is
obliged to pawn his dishes and his cloak
while he is employed upon his play, to rise
to the dignity of the old tragedy. Forcel-
lini (v. pignero) so explains it rightly. As
to ‘alveolos ’ see S. v. 88; and on ‘ laena,’
iii. 283. Atreus and the other members of
‘ saeva Pelopis domus’ (Hor. C. i. 6. 8, see
note) furnished subjeets for numberless
tragedies.

74. Non habet infelix Numitor] This
name he takes for the same purpose in the
next satire (viii. 93). He says the great
man (poor fellow) has nothing to send to
his friend, but plenty to give to his mis-
treas, and enough to buy meat for his tame
lion: of course, he addS, the beast costs
less and eats less thau a poet. [Ribbeck
places 74 -78 after v. 93.]

78. capiunt plu-5] One MS. (N timberg)
has ‘eapiuntss and Heinrich appears to have
approved that reading (Animadv. in auct.
vet. p. 109, referred to by Jahn, V. L.).

¹79. jaceat Lucanus in hortis] The poet
M. Annaeus Lucanus inherited a large sor-
tune from his father, who was a native of
Corduba in Hispania, and collector of the
imperial revenues. He is said to have died
at the age of 26, Aa). 65, in consequence of
having· taken part in Piso’s conspiracy
against Nero. To avoid the executioner he
opened his own veins. He was therefore
dead when this satire was written. We
know nothing of Serranus. Saleius is the
man alluded to above (note on v. 46). He
says Lucan may be happy in his renown
because he is rich, but what is any amount

of fame to these poor wretcheS‚ suppose
they get it Ρ

83. laetam fecit quum Statius Urbem]
The poet P. Papinius Statius was the son
of a schoolmaster at Neapolis. He was
patronized by Domitian, whom he flattered
in the usual way. His poem called Thebais,
relating entirely to the expedition against
Thebes which Aeschylus has made the sub-
ject ofa tragedy‚occupied him twelve year-S,
a year for each book, as he says at the end
of the poem, “O mihi bissenos multum
vigilata per annos Thebai.'’ It was finished
some time between aa). 87 and 90, and
therefore was begun before Domitian be-
came emperor, an). 81. During the time
it was composing he recited parts of it, and
at that time he seems to have been poor.
WVhether he afterwards profited by the pa·
tronage of the emperor or not is unknown.
By J uvenal’s description his poem seems to
have been highly thought of, and his
manner of reciting it was attractive. ‘ Car-
men’ is used for a book or division of an
entire poem, as by Lucretius vi. 938,
“qnod in primo quoque carmine claret.”
See note on Horace, Epod. xiv. 7, ‘⁴ olim
promissum carmen.’' The Thebais in
twelve books, the Achilleis, an uniinished
poem, in two, and the Silvae, a collection
of smaller poemS, in five, are all we have
of Statius' works. It seems he wrote tra-
gedies, for J uvenal says he would have
star-ved if he had not sold his Agave to
Paris (see vi. 87, n.).

86. fregit subsellia] See S. i. 13.

87. intactam Paridi nisi vendatdqaven]
‘Unloes he sells his virgin Agave to Paris?
