1. Exemplo quodeunque malo] One sense
of ‘exemplum ' is a pattern fex-imitation, and
that which is done ‘malo exemplo ’ is a bad
action not fit to be imitated. Grangneus
quotes Seneca (Ep. xlii.) : ‘⁶ Nee ulla major
poena nequitiae est quam quod sibi ac suis
displicet.” Juvenal 8001118 to have 101110111-
bered these words. ‘ Exemplo ’ is the abla-
tive of quality, as it is called.

2. se Judice nemo nocens absolvilzcr,]
These words appear to have become pro-
verbial. They are quoted by the Scholiasts
on Statius (Theb.iii. 4⁴) and Lucan (Phars.
vii. 784), and by Macrobius (Somn. Scip.
i. 10. 12) (Jahn, V. L.).

4. Praetoris viee-rit urum] In criminal
trials a praetor usually presided. The ju-
diees were chosen by lot from the ‘ 1111111111
judicum,’ the names being drawn from an
urn. It would be possible for the praetor
to tamper with the urn as here supposed,
and judices to be secured who would aequit
the defendant against their oaths. Hein-
rich says this is the praetor’s lying 111-0.
Others take it for the urn into which the
tablets of the judices were put. It does
not matter much. Ι (10 not see however
why the urn should be called ‘ Praetoris‚’
unless it was meant that he was a party
to the eriine. Τ 110 Scholium (which seems
to be from two hands) gives both explana-
tions, “ nihil prodest corrupisse judicem ;
vel subposuisse pro sorte.” Ruperti says
it is ‘ gratia Praetoris,' which would have
no meaning. Juvenal says, the guilty man
is his own judex, and is not acquitted
though corrupt influence may win, through
the praetor’s lying urn : he has a judex
within whom no influence can corrupt.
‘Absolve ' was the legal word for acquittal,
represented by a tablet with A upon it.

Each judex had three,the other two marked
C (condemno) and N. L. (non liquet)
which was an open verdict. Many MSS.
have ‘fallacis‚' which is also in nearly all
the old editions. P. and some others have
the ablativo, which no doubt is right.
‘ Urnain ’ is in most MSS. and old editions.
But it has no meaning. ‘ Vincere ’ is the
teehnieal word for winning a cause. See
iv. 136, where it applies to a deliberation.

[Perhaps there is no evidence which
shows how the ‘judices' οι· ‘jury’ were
named under the Empire, nnd it is possible
that the manner of choosing them was not
the same 118 10 the times of the chublic.
By the Lex Servilia of Glaucia, enacted
between 13.c. 106 and 100, the prosecutor
and defendant each named one hundred
‘judices' from the ‘album judicum‚’ and
the plaintiff and defendant severally re-
jected or challenged fifty. The jury voted
on the gnilt or innocenee of the defendant
by putting their tablcts in a box named
Site11a; and when all the votes were east,
the praetor counted them and pronouneed
the verdiet. The fragments of this Lex
have been pnblished, restored, and ex·
plained by Klenze, Berlin, 1825.]

5. Quid sentire putas] He asks what
hc supposes his friends all think of the
fraud that has been practised upon hi1n;
meaning it should be a comfort to him to
think they sympathized with him and con-
demned the thief; but besides (he adds),
your fortune is not so small that you should
feel the loss much, and many others suffer
as you are suffering. This is the con-
nexion, which some have missod. ‘Sed’
and ‘ nec ' often come together in this way
where something is added. See xi. 136
and elsewhere.
