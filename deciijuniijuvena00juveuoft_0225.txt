SATIRA VII.

175

Ipsi magna sonant, sed tunc quum creditor audit
Praecipue, vel si tetigit latus acrior illo

Qui venit ad dubium grandi cum codice nomen.

110

Tunc immensa cavi spirant mendacia folles

Conspuiturque sinus.

Veram deprendere messem

Si libet, 111110 0011111111 patrimonia causidicorum,
Parte alia solum russati 110110 Lacernae.

Consedere Duces : surg-is tu pallidus Ajax

108. Ipsi magna sommh] They talk
very big of their own accord (ipsi), but
still more if the creditor is listeuing for
whom they are actiug; or louder still if
the client is eager and nudges his ¹ causi-
dicus,’ being afraid of losing his money.
⁸ Dubium nomen ’ is a doubtful debt. Sec
note on Horace, Epp. ii. 1. 105: “Cautos
nominibus rectis.'’ This creditor, who the
Scholiast says is an ‘argentarius,' a banker,
brings his books to prove the debt. ⁴ Co-
dex' (or ‘oeudex ') is properly something
of wood, and was first applied to wooden
tablets, but afterwards was used for any
written document or book, and particularly
for bankers’ books. This is in substance
the Scholiast’s explanation, “Cautionem
habens multorum temporum (that is, a
debt of long standing, 500 11010 011 Hor. 1.
0.), creditorem argentarium significat qni
instant-ius debitum petit si debitor ei coe-
perit esse suspectus.'’ The other inter-
pretations that have been given 1 believe
to be wrong. Madvig, whom ΜΓ. Mayor
follows, makes the creditor who is listening
the lawyer’s creditor, but the man who
nudges him 8 ‘dives litigator’ come to
employ him. Heinrich thinks ‘ acrior illo’
is not clear, and prefers ‘aerior ille.' I
think ‘ille’ is better, but there is no MSS.
authority for it. [Ribbeck has ‘aegrior'
instead of ¹ acrior.’]

111. spirant mendacia folles] The bel-
lows are his cheeks. Compare Persius, v.
10, sqq„ “Tu neque anhelanti coquitur
dum massa camino Folle premis ventos‚’'
&c.; and Horace, whom Persius imitates,

‘⁸ At tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras
Usque laborantes dum ferrum molliat

Utfflvis imitare.” (S. i. 4. 19, sqq.)

The Scholiast says on ‘ conspuitur sinus‚’
‘⁶ Propter fascinum verborum ter sibi in
sinus spuunt et videntur fascinum arcere
ut Persius de matertera (S. ii. 31). Vel
incipiunt multa sibi promittentes in sinum
spuere vel a loquendo multum spuunt.”

The first of these explanations Madvig
adoptS, that he spits to avert the bad con-
sequences of his lying, and ΜΓ. Mayor
follows him. As far as 1 know they stand
alone. In this sense ‘despuere’ would be
used. ‘Couspuitur ’ means that he splut-
ters his froth all over the folds of his ‘toga'
There is no ‘fascinum' or omen or any
thing else to avert.

112. Veram deprendere messem] If
you want to know the real amount of his
harvest, put on one side the fortunes of a
hundred lawyerS, aud ou the other that of
Lacerna, who was 8 driver in the Circus,
and they may be equal. Servius on virgil
(Georg. iv. 231, “ duo tempora messis'')
quotes this line. The drivers were divided
into four parties, called ‘factiones,’ and
distinguished by the colour of their dress3 ·
there was the white (alba), red (russata),
dark green (prasina), and light green (ve-
neta). See below, S. xi. 198: “eventum
viridis quo colligo panni.'’ ‘ Pone ' is not
‘put thern in scales,’ as Ruperti sayS.
Ascensius’ reading ‘ verum ' is bad, though
Ruperti says ‘non male’ to it. Many of
the MSS. writers were puzzled by the
words ‘russati pone Lacernae,’ probably
from not knowing that Laeerna was a
proper name, which is stated by the Scho-
liast : ‘⁴ Lacernae .- nomen aurigae abjecti,
ex colore Russxrt‘s. LACERNA sub Do-
mitiano auriga fuit.'’ ‘ Rus satipone' is a
common reading, and one Scholium quoted
by Jahn says gravely ‘satipoue' is the
name of a country house.

115. Consedere Duces :] What follows
is a parody of the contest between Ajax and
Ulysses for Achilles’ 811110111- 111 Ovid (Met.
xiii. 1, sqq.)‚ beginning

“ Consedere duces ς et vulgi stante corona
SqugtK ad hos clipei dominus septemplicis

Ruperti informs us that those who are going·
to speak rise up, and while they are speak-
ing they stand ; but the ‘judices ’ and
‘ praetor ' sit and listen.
