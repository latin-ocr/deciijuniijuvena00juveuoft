SATIRA VIII.

Exsulibus juvenes ipsius Consulis et quos
Magnum aliquid dubia pro libertate deceret,
Quod miraretur cum Coclite Mucius et quae

Imperii lines Tiberinum virgo natavit.

Occulta ad Patres produxit crimina servus
Mati-onis lugendus : at illos verbera justis
Afficiunt poenis et legum prima securis.

Malo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis

Aeacidae similis Vulcaniaque arma capessas,

Quam te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.
Et tamen, ut longe repetas long-eque revolvas
Nomen, ab infami gentem deducis asylo.
Llajorum primus quisquis fuit ille tuorum,

Aut pastor fuit aut illud quod dicere nolo.

been distinguishing themselves in the
strengthening of liberty only partially es-
tablished, and cxciting the admiration of
such men as Horatius Cocles (who de-
fended the bridge), Mucius Scaevola (who
put his hand in the fire before King
Porsena, having vowed with 300 others to
kill him), and Cloelia who, being a pri-
soner with other women iu Porsena’s
camp, swam across the Tiber, and escaped.
Juvenal seems to have had Livy's narra-
tive in his mind (ii. 5), for he describes the
people as gazing in wonder at these youths,
‘⁶' illos οο potissmium 1111110, patriam libera-
tam, patrem liberatorem, consulatum or-
tum ex domo Junia, Patres, plebem, qnie-
quid deorum hominumque Romanorum
esset, induxisse in animum ut superbo quon-
dam regi tum infesto exsuli proderent.'’
The force of the imperfect ‘ laxabant ' must
he attended to.

265. Imperii fine-s· Tiberinum] Before
the attack of Porsena the Romans had
some laud on the north bank of the Tiber
which Romulus (according to the story) had
taken from the Veientes. They had also
possession of the hill J aniculum. Porsena
drove them across the river, aud when the
war was finished by the. defeat of the
Romam, peace was given on the condition
that the Veientes should have back their
land. Livy (ii. 13) puts the ease favour-
ahly for Rome, “ dc agro Veientibus resti-
tuendo impetratum ;'’ on which Niebuhr
remarks that “ 0110 cannot read such arro-
gant language without indignation '‘ (i.
546).

267. Matronis luyendus :] Livy says of
Brutus, who fell in battle against the Tar-

275

quinii, that his funeral was celebrated with
much pomp; but that which graced it most
was the public mourning, “ eo ante omnia
insignis quia matronae annum ut parentem
eum luxerunt, quod tam acer ultor violatae
pudicitiae fuisset.’' Taking his word from
this Juvenal says the slave deserved to be
mourned after his death by matrons, while
the young men were justly punished with
§tripes and the axe. The eontrast through-
out is between the slave and the aristocrats.
What Juvenal says about the scourge or
axe is put into prose by Heinrich thus:
“ at illos prima lex justis poenis affecit per
verbera et securim? This gives the mean-
ing. Juvenal says the blows and the axe
were the first ordered by the ‘ legcsss
which name therefore he refuses to the
king’s laws. Under the republic ‘leges’
properly were only such laws as were
passed at the ‘ comitia centuriata ' or
‘ tributa? Hor. Epp. i. 16. 41, n.

270. Vulcaniaque arma capessas,] ‘And
handle the armour of Vulean as he did? As
Heinrich sayS, ‘similiter ’ may be supplied
from ‘ similis.' As to this armoni· which
I‘Iepbaestus made for Achilles at the in-
stance of Thetis, see 11. xviii. 369, sqq.

272. Et tamen, ut longe repetas] ‘And
yet be what you may, trace back your name
as far as you can, still you can but get back
to Romulus’ asylu1n‚’ which Livy says was
the first foundation of the Roman power:
¹‘ Eo ex finitimis populis turba omnis siue
discrimine liberam servus esset avida nova-
rum rerum profugit 3 idque primum ad
coeptam magnitudinem roboris fuit '' (Livy,
i. 8). Niebuhr denies that “ in ancient
times this rabble ean have been couceived
