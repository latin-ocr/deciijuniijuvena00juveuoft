pei-tius (iii. 23. 5). Whether Cicero ever
used it with other persons is doubtful.
The MSS. vary in the places where he
seems to do so. There is also a variatiou
here, two MSS. having ‘quidem‚' but one
of these is of no character. It seems to
be a copyist's error, and the metre will
not admit of it. In Heinrich’s text there
is ‘quidem,’ I suppose by mistake. Below
(S. v. 45) we have “Non equidem hoc
dubites,’' where Heinrich says, perhaps
truly, that ‘equidem' is nothing more
than ‘quide-ms and differs from it only as
ἐκεῖνος from κεῖνος. Persius says, “As
far as Ι am concerned let henceforth (pro-
tinus) all be fair; I care for nothing.
Bravo ! all ; you shall all be most wonder-
ful things. Are you satisfied with this?
Here, you say, let no one commit nui-
sance. Paint up two snakes; boys, mind
this place is sacred, go outside. Ι too go
away.'' ‘Pinge duos angues' are the
words of Persius obeying orders. Snakes
were commonly painted or carved on
sacred places to represent the Genius loci,
and to protect the walls from this sort of
profanation. The Scholiast on Aristoph.
Plutus, 733, ἐξῃξάτην οὐν δύο δράκοντ’
ἐκ ΤΟΙΙ νεώ SRJS, Κοινῶς μὲν πᾶσι Τοῖς ηρωσί
δράκοντες παρετίθεντο. Jahn refers to an
inscription, accompanied by two snakes, on
the wall of a room under the baths of
Titus at Rome, which was part of Nero's
Golden House3 “DVODECI neos Er
DIANAM ET 101Ἒ11 OPTUMUM MAXIMUM
HABEAT IRATOS QUISQUIS 1110 ΜΙΧΕΙΠΤ
AUT CACARIT.'' Similar inscriptions were
commonly placed on tombs. Fea (on Hor.
A. P. 470: “utrum Minxerit 111 patrios
cineres’') gives three from Gruter and
Fabretti. See Juv. i. 131: “Cujus ad
effigiem non tantum meiere fas est.'’
‘ Oletmn,’ ‘ oletare‚' are words not of com-
mon occurrence. They are connected with
‘oleo.' (See Forcellini.) Professor Key
says the form ‘ faxim ³ arises out of the old
termination of the present perfect sub-
junctive ‘ esim‚' instead of the later termi-
nation ‘erim.’ (L. G. 566.) The forms
‘ faxo ’ and ‘ faxim ’ are discussed at length
by Madvig, Opusc. ii. 60, sqq„ ‘ dc forma.-

rum quarundam verbi Latini natura et
usu disputatio.’ ‘Fac-sim' 15 like πράκ-
σαιμι.

The MSS. and editions vary in v. 111.
Most have ‘ 01111105 etenim? Pithoeus first
gave the reading of the text, which is
that also of Casaubon and Heinrich. These
two editors have a (P) after ‘juvat.’
Passow and other modern editors omit it.
I think ‘etenim' is weak and an interpo-
lation. The note of interrogation is a
matter of no great importance.

114. Seeuz't Lucilius urbem ,] He breaks
off suddenly from his irony and asks, if
Lucilius and Horace were allowed, one to
Iash the town and the other to turn them
into quiet ridicule, whether he may not
mutter a word Ρ Α5 to Lucilius much will
be found in Hor. S. i. 1ος ii. i. See Juv. i. ·
165: “ Ense velut stricto quoties Lucilius
ardens Infremuit.” With ‘secuit‚' ‘ver-
bere’ may be supplied, as in Juv. S. x.
316: “secat ille cruentis Verberibus.”
Horace (S. ii. 1. 67) speaks of Metellus
and Lupus as objects of Lucilius’ satire.
The Lupus in question was perhaps L.
Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, consul B.c.
156. Mucius' name occurs in two frag-
ments of Lucilius, but there is nothing to
guide us to the person. It was probably
either P. Mucius Scaevola, cos. Rc. 133,
and father of the eminent jurist, the ponti-
fex Q. Mucius Scaevola (to whose teaching
Cicero attached himself aster the death of
his namesake the augur, as he says at the
beginning of the treatise De Amicitia), or
the augur himself. It is impossible to
say what offence either of them may have
given Lucilius. The augur married t-he
daughter of Lucilius' friend Laelius. Mu-
cius is referred to by J uv. i. 154. ‘Genui-
num fregit' is perhaps imitated from
Horace's “fragili quaerens illidere dentem
Offendet solido ·'' (S. ii. 1. 77). As to
‘genuinum ³ see note on Juv. v. 69.

116. Omne vafer vitium] This is a cele-
brated description of Horace’s style of
satire, which no doubt was in the main
good-natured and free from bitterness. But
it made him a good many enemies. ‘Po-
pulum suspendere naso' is like ‘suspen-
