of borrowed money, or hire them, Ruperti
supposes, as in vi. 352, “ Ut spectet ludos
conducit Ogulnia vestem? I do not think
that is the meaning3 nor does ‘sumitur'
mean ‘ consumitur,' as Heinrich snyS.

182. ambitiosa Paupertate] Ruperti (on
vii. 138) quotes Seneca. (Epp. 50). · “Non
ego ambitiosus sum sed nemo aliter potest
viv ere; non ego sumptuosus sum sed urbs
ipsa magnas impensas exigitss'

184. Quid da8]‘ What sums do you„ tyive
the servants that you may have the privi-
lege of attending sometimes the “salutatio '’
of Cossus P’ which was the cognomen of a
branch of the Cornelia gens. So the man
Horace meets on the Sacra Via, who wants
to get introduced to Maecenas, says:

“ Haud mihi deero:
Muneribus servos corrumpam ς non hodie si
Exclnsus fuero desistam.'’ (S. i. 9. 56.)

185. Ut te respiciat] A Fabricius Veiento
is mentioned by name in S. iv. 113; vi. 113.
He was sent into banishment in the reign
of Nero, but returned in Domitian’s, and
distinguished himself as an informer and a
flatterer of the emperor. He also had the
favour of Nerva, as we learn from Pliny
(Epp. iv. 22): “ Coenabat Nerva cum
paucis. Veiento proximus atque etiam in
sinu recumbebat. Dixi omnia quum ho-
minem nominavi.'' It will now be under-
stood why men were willing to pay even for
a condescending look of this man, ‘clauso
labello‚’ without a word to back it.

186. Ille metit barbanu] “One barhes
his man, anothertrims his slave'’ (Holyday).
This is correct. When a. youth first shaved
it was a holiday‚ and the young down was
sometimes offered to some god, with the
long hair, worn in boyhood‚but cut off when
the ‘toga virilis’ was put οιι. This cere-
ῗίιῖῗὲἕέἰὲἕιῖξῗῗέιίἳέἕ οὗῖῗιῖἶῖιέῗιῖἒξῗξιζῖιζῗὲ
such a. case, and says the house was inune-
diately full of cakes offered to the slave, as
if he were a sonos the family. ‘Libis vcna-
libus’ means, as Britannicus says, cakcs

which the slave would scll to make money
by, which money would go to increase his
‘peculiunh’

‘⁴ Di doni la sua casa ecco trabocca

Che quei 1·iveude.’' (Accio.)

‘⁴ Pay tributary craeknells, which he sells;
And with our otferings help to raisc his
vails.” (Dryden.)

Pithoeus, GrangaeuS, and Henninius have
‘genialibus ' for ‘ venalibus‚’ and Heinrich
follows them, though in his note he prefers
‘venalibus.’ [Ribbeck has ‘vernalibus.']
There is no MS. authority for ‘geniali-
bus‚' which would mean that the cakcs
were offerings to the genius of the boy. As
to ‘ liba‚’ see notes on Hor. S. ii. 7. 103;
Epp. i. 10. 10. As to the matter of the
hair, Martial has an epigram for a like
occasion (ἰ. 32) beginning—

“ Hos tibi, Phoebe, vovet totos a vertice

crines
Encolpus domini centurionis amor :'’

and two others. ix. 17, 18, on the hair of
Earinus, a favourite slave, offered to Aescu-
la ius.

p187. Accipe et istud Fermentum] ‘ Takc
this home to stir your bile.' This is the
way Forcelliui and most of the commen-
tators explain ‘ fermentum. ' Persius uses
it in another sense (i. 24). It may be used
for any thing w hich taken' 1nw ardly fer ments.
The words are addressed by Umbricius to
his friend; ‘istud’ being the fact that fol-
lows, of which what goes before is au illus-
tration. Others take the words as those of
the man presenting his cake to the slave, as
if ‘ sementum ' were equivalent to ⁴ panem!
⁶ That for yourself, sir,’ is Stapylton’s trans-
lation. The other is right. The ‘peculium'
of a slave was the property he was able to
acquire for himself by such means as his
master might allow, and which would arisc
in various ways, direct and indirect. It was
virtually his own, but. strictly no slave could
hold property. Slaves osten accumulatcd
large sums, purchased their freedom, and
