A. PERSII FLACCI

His ego centenas ausim deposcere fauces,

Ut quantum mihi te sinuoso in pectore fixi

Voce traham pura, totumque hoc verba resignent
Quod latet arcana non enarrabile fibra.

Cum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cessit,

30

Bullaque succinctis Laribus donata pependit 3
Cum blandi comites totaque impune Suburra
Permisit sparsisse oculos jam candidus umbo 3
Cumque iter ambiguum est, et vitae nescius error

Didueit trepidas ramosa in compita mentes,

Me tibi supposui: teneros tu suscipis annos
Socratico, Cornute, sinu ς tunc fallere sollers

27. sinuoso in pectore fixa] ‘ How deep
I have fastened you in the folds of my
breast I may with voice sincere declam-e,
and my words may open all that lies unut-
terable in my secret heart.' ‘ Γ1’1’111111111,’
drag forth, is used in connexion with ‘ fixi.³
His love was nailed there so fast that it re-
quired a hundred-tongue power to bring it
out. As to ‘ fibra ⁹ see S. i. 47, 11.

30. eustos mihi purpura caesia] This
is explained on Horace, Epod. v. 7, “ Per
hoc inane purpurae decus precor.” The
‘ toga praetexta,' with the purple border, is
meant, which was worn by boys and laid
aside by them when they took the ‘toga
virilis.' The ‘ toga praetexta. ' was also
worn by consuls and all senators, which
leads Pliny to say (H. N. ix. 36), “ Huic
(purpurae) fasces securesque Romanae viam
faciunt: idemque pro majestate pueritiae
est.'' This explains ‘ custos purpura? As
to ‘ bulla ' see the above note 011 Horace,
as well as those on Epp. i. 1. 4, and Juv.
S. v. 164, n.‚ “ Etruscum puero si contigit
aurum.’' The Lares whose statues were
set up in little chapels of their own (⁴ la-
raria‚' J uv. viii. 111) were draped figures,
In the Dietionary of Mythology we are
told that they wore the ‘ cinctus Gabinus‚’
which was an old way of wearing the
‘ toga ' so as to form of it a girdle round
the waist. Ι am not aware that there is
any authority for this statement. Ovid
calls them ‘incinctos Lares' (S. iii. 26).
To the Lares a boy dedicated his ‘bulla'
when he put it away, and hung it up 111
their chapel.

32. Cum blandi comites totaque impune
Subur—ra] ⁴ When friends are complaisant?
As soon as the boy becomes a man, the
people about him alter their tone. It must
be rememhered that every Roman of any

wealth or station had plenty of followers,
who left him very little to himself. Some
part of the folds of a ‘toga,’ over the chest,
was called ‘ umbo,’ on which subject Becker
may bc consultcd (Gallus, Exc. on the Male
Attire, Engl. Ahr. p. 339), and Dict. Ant.
Toga. Here it is put for the whole ‘ toga.'
‘Jam caudidus' means that it no longer
hore the purple border, but was all white
(‘ toga pura ³), which was the usual colour.
He means that when he came to wear the
man's ‘toga' he had no ‘ paedagogus’ to
keep him from the bad parts of the town,
where he might go and look about him as
much as he pleased. As to the ‘ Suburra,'
the worst and most crowded street in Rome,
see Juv. iii. 5, n.

34. Cumque iter ambiguum est,] This
is connected with the old story of Prodicus,
referred to on iii. 56. ‘ Trepidas ' means
confused as to their choice os a path among
the many travelling roads of life. ‘ Didu-
cit ' means ‘ leads astray.' ‘ Deducit ’ is
wrong. Jahn has it. It is the common
copyist's mistake.

36. Me tibi supposui :] This is only ‘ Ι
put myself under you.j Jahn says it is “ ut
filium adsciticimn, quem sibi supponere
dicunt parentes (Plaut.).'' This is quite
beside the meaning. He went to his
teacher not as a foundling or as a supposi-
titious child, but as a pupil. His language
is very tcnder. Cornutus received him to
his bosom, as Socrates received his dis-
ciples‚ to whom he usually became much
attached.

37. fallere sollers] ‘ Unvermerkt,' im-
perceptible, unobserved (Heinrich). This
seems to be the meaning. It agrees with
the explanations of the Scholiast and
casaubon. J ahn's note I cannot under-
stand, “ Regula dicitur sollers fallere, non
