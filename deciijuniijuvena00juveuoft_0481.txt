Nunc ferus et violens: at si vocet, haud mora dicas,
‘ Quidnam igitur faciam ⁸? ncc nunc cum arcessat et ultro

Exieras, nec nunc.”

Non in festuca lictor quam jactat ineptus.

see note on Hor. C. ii. 11. 4. ‘ Haud mora '
must be joined closely with ‘ dieas!
⁸ Straightway you would say, that then
must 1 do ?’ Jahn has ‘ haud mora,
dicas,’ making these words the man’s
answer to the summons, what follows is
copied closely from Terence (Eunuch. i. 1),
and Horace has copied it as closely (Sat.
ii. 3. 262):

“Quid igitur faciam Ρ Non eam Ρ ne nunc
quidem
Quum arcessor ultr0.''

The answer of the slave is, ‘ You would not
even now if you had left her whole and
sound. Here, here is the man we look for ;
here, not in the rod which the silly lictor
flourishes ’ (v. 75, n.). Horace has “ Hic
est aut nusquam quod quaerimus‚” Epp. i.
17. 39. The man Persius means is he who
is ‘totus et integer.’ Terence has ‘ ne
nunc quidem‚' and therefore Jahn and
Heinrich have ‘ ne nunc ’ here, as Bentley
has in the corresponding place of Horace.
But the best MSS. and early editors, as
well as Passow and Orelli, have ‘ nee nunc,'
which is equivalent to ‘ne nunc quidem.'
‘Ne nunc,' if it is Latin, has not the force
of ‘ nee nunc? Several MSS. have ‘ nunc
nunc’ in 174, which only supports ‘ nec‚’
both words being abbreviated iu the MSS.

176. Jus habet ille sui palpo] He takes
another case, and asks “is that eajoling fel-
low ‘sui juris' who is led open-mouthed
by ambition Ρ ” A man who was ‘sui
juris ' was not in the legal power of
another. [This term ‘ sui juris ' is used by
the Roman law writers when they are
22⁹2}&5952223332153122155‘323553335&
of persons z “sequitur de iure personarum
alia divisio, nam quaedam personae sui

’ iuris sunt, quaedam alieno iuri sul›ieetae.’'

Gaius, i. ξ 48.] ‘ Palpo ’ is a noun formed
like ‘ cachinno' (S. i. 12, n.), and means a
flatterer, such as one must be who goes

about canvassing for votes. ‘Hiantcm'
expresses the man’s eagerncss, as in Hor.
S. i. 2. 88, “ne si facies ut saepe deeora
Molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat
hiantem.’' ‘Ambitio' is called ‘cretatae
because candidates had their togas well

whitcned with ‘ creta,' fullei-’s earth, from ·

which practice they got their name. See
note on Hor. S. ii. 2. 61, and above S. ii. 40,
‘⁴ quamvis te albata rogarit.”

177. Wyila et cicer inyere larqe] So
in Horace the man Servius Oppidius says
to his sonS, “ In cicere atque faba bona tu
perdasque lupinis, Latus ut in Circo spatiere
et aeneus ut stes,’' S. ii. 3. 182, sq.. where
it is stated on the authority of the Scholiast
that the aediles were wont at the Floralia
to distribute grain to the people. ‘ Nostra
Floralia’ is the poet identifying himself
ironically with the man of the text. The
Floralia were celebrated in honour of Flora.
from the 28th of April to the 2nd of May
inclusive, with much dissipation and licen-
tiousness. The old men are called ‘aprici ’
because they love the sun. See note on
S. iv. 18. As to ‘ingere,' see v. 6, n.

179. Αἰ cum Herodis venere dies‚] Other
slaves are those of superstition. and to these
he now passes. The Scholiast says that
‘ Herodis dies ' means the birthday of
Herod the Great observcd by his sect the
Herodians. thether this king’s birth-
day was kept or not I do not believe
Persius knew 0r carcd, any more than
Horace's friend knew what he was speaking
of when he excused himself on the score of
the (lay being the thirtieth sabbath (S. i.
9. 63, “hodie tricesima sabbata’'). The
Romans were well acquainted with the
name of Herod, who ruled Judaca in the
interest of Rome, and whose party was
favourable to the Roman government.
Josephus refers to the illuminations at the
Jewish festivals (c. Apion. ii. 10). He says
ironically in answer to a charge that they
had been imposed upon by a fellow aeting-
