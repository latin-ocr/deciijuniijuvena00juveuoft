D. JUNII JUVENALI S

Gaudebit nido ; viridem thoraca jubebit

Vilibus ancipites fungi ponentur amicis,
Boletus domino, sed quales Claudius edit
Ante illum uxoris post quem nil amplius edit.
Virro sibi 01 reliquis Yirronibus illa jubebit

Scholiast had Migale‚ for he derives the

still the friend will not give him up, but will

that way. The man being rich is still
worth looking after. This is the 11·3)· Bri-
1311111035 takes the words, and he is right.
The translators take them so. Migale is 3
contemptuous word, but it is 1115 wife. Ru-
perti and Heinrich take it for his ‘ concu-
bina,’ because children born in concubinage
had not the rights of children born in wed—
lock, and so the fortune-hunter would not
be afraid of them. (See Smith' 5 Dict. Ant„

‘Concubina. ³) But there was nothing to

1031 you are poor, ⁸vou :nay have as many
children as 3‘ou please, aud the Virros will
make much of them. Mauso says this 15
the obvious and simple meaning, and that
all others are “mirae ne dicam ineptae,
interpretationes,³ '' and Mr. Ma3or follows
him, but they are 00113131) wrong.

145. parasitus venerit infans] A para-
site is 3 guest out of his place, and 3

50 called.

146. Vilibus ancipites] ‘ Vilibus amicis,'
poor friends, friends who are worth nothing.

We say men are worth 111131 they have.
These Romans seem to have had the same
standard of 11 01·.111 [Ribbeck transposes
146, 147, and 1135 them thus:

“ Boletus domino, fungi porgentur amicis
Vilibus ancipites nec quales Claudius

147. Boletus domino 5] As to these

which the Emperor Claudius was poisoned

which epigram ·‘ of his friend Martial³³
Heinrich supposes Juvenal 10 have had 111

duntur boletos merito posuerim ; optimi

crimen 3111130105, veneno Tiberio Claudio
principi per hanc occasionem a conjuge
Agrippina dato : quo facto illa terris vene-
