Quosdam praecipitat subjecta potentia magnac
Invidiae ς mergit longa :itque insignis honorum
Pagina 3 descendunt statuae restemque sequuntur.
Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis

Caedit, et immeritis franguntur crura caballis,

Jam stridunt ignes, jam follibus atque caminis
Ardet adoratum populo eaput, et crepat ingens
Sejanus: deinde ex facie toto orbe secunda,
Fiunt urceoli, pelveS, sartago, patellae.

tute ‘mos’ for ‘fus‚' which is prosy und
feeble. 1 suppose ‘fas’ only means that
it is considered religious to do so. ‘ Ince-
rare’ is taken from the practice of writing
prayers aud vows ou waxed tablets, and
hanging them on the statue of the god to
whom they were addressed ⁴‘ Substitute
saints for gods and the passage will accord
with the practice iu Catholic churchcs at
this day '' (Gifford). C. Valesius, followed
by Ruperti, attributes to this practice the
expression θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται (Odyss.
i. 267). The common suppliant's position
was embracing the knees. Iu Iliad vi.
303 the ‘ peplus ' is laid upon the kuees of
Athenaea. Madvig suggested, and Jahn
has adopted, ‘incerate' for ‘ incerare,' put-
ting a. longer stop at ‘pctuntmf The
abruptness of the verse with this reading
would be enough to condemn it, if there
were no other objection.

58. Payimu] The Scholiast explains
this as a bronze tablet which is set up be-
fore these busts, and sets forth all their
honours. Forcellini gives an instance of
¹ marmorea pagina! ‘Mergit ' is ‘drowns
him‚’ as ‘ praecipitat' is ‘throws him down
head foremost! As to ‘descendunt sta-
tuae’ see S. viii. 18: “ Frangenda miseram
funestat imagine gentem.'’ ‘Restcmque
sequuntur’ is like Horace's “Tortum digna
sequi potius quam ducere funem ’' (Epp.
i. 10. 48). Α spirited eugraving of such a
soene will be found in Retsch's Illustra-
tious of Schillcr’s Lied von der Glocke.
We have had reference before to tri-
umphal chariots (S. vii. 125) : “hujus enim
stat currus aeneuS, alti Quadrijuges iu
vestibulis ;'’ and (viii. 3): “stantes in
curribus AEmiliauos.”

61. Jam stridunt ignem] He goes on to
illustrate his case by the example of Seja-
nus. That man was son of Seius Strabo,
commander of the praetor-ian troops, which
brought him into early intimacy with

65

Tiberius. From the time that Tiberius be-
came emperor Ad). 14 till A.1›. 31, Sejanus
was his chief favourite and the adviser of
some of his worst crimes. He was am-
bitious of the imperial power, and his
designs became known to or suspected by
Tiberius, who in ΔΛ). 31 wrote from Ca-
preae such a letter to the Senate conceruing
Sejanus as to lead to his execution. His
statues were forthwith pulled down, his
body was thrown down the Gemoniae (a.
precipice on the Aventine), torn to pieces
by the populace, the small remains of it
dragged about the streets‚ aud then throwu
into the Tiber. All that Juvenal says is
borne out by Dion Cassius, l. 58. c. 11.
63. ez· facie toto orbe secunda] Dion
(58. 4) says that bronze statues were
erected to Sejanus on an equality with
Tiberius in every direction; they were
represented in pictures togethcr; gilded
chariots were brought into the theatres in
honour of both alike ; they were voted

joint consuls for five years; it was decreed

that they should be met with equal honours
whenever they entered Rome, and sacrifices
were offered before the images of Sejanus
as before those of Tiberius. Out of the
bronze statues of the man so honoured
Juvenal says were made little jugs, basius,
kettlcs, and pans or platters. ‘ Patellae’
(the diminutive form of ‘ patina ’) is the
reading of nearly every MS„ but ‘matellae’
is found iu one, and the Scholiast seems to
have had it, for he explains it by ‘conchae
breves aut vasa turpia.' ‘ Matella ' is a.
chamber utensil [and ‘ matellae ' is the
reading of Jahn and Ribbeck]-

65. Pone domi lauram] This decoratiug
the doors with wreaths was common, as we
have seen, ou joyful occasions. See S. vi.
51, where the occasion is a wedding ς ix.
85, the birth of a child; and xii. 91, the
return of a friend. The Scholiast quotes a
line which Juvenal seems to have borrowed:
