It seems to mean this, and the word is used

407. [astantem reyz' Armenio] Armenia
was reduced to a Roman province by Tra-

like ‘strictus ensis‚' a sword unsheathed? jan, who went in person at the head of a

As the woman is in the company of soldiers
this way of speaking is not inappropriate.
The commentators and translators gene-
rally understand ‘ strictis ’ as ‘ bare.’
Ruperti follows Britannicus, who explains
it as “ita coarctatis ut in summo natent
sinu.'' The Scholiast has “adhuc exstanti-
bus vel sine sudore.'’ He alludes to the
variant ‘siccis' which appears in P. and
several good MSS„ and is taken into the
text by Jahn. [Ribbeck has ‘ siccis.’]

403. Quid Seres, quid Thraces ayant ;]
This is as much as to say she knew what
no one else cared to know. Horace speaks
of the Seres as an indefinite sort of people
far away in the East : “ Sive subjectos
orientis orae Seras et Indos’' (C. i. 12. 55).
He thinks it very unnecessary for Maece-
nas to trouble himself about

‘⁶ Quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisqge ielliiscigsg} )

See notes on those places and on C. iv. 15.
23: “Non Seres infidive Persae.'' ‘ Thraces '
stands for the remoter Scythian tribes,
about whom the Romans did not trouble
themselves much. ‘ Secreta ’ means the in-
trigues between a stepmothor and her step-
son. For ‘diripiatur ² M. and a good many
MSS. and editions have ‘ decipiatur‚’ which
most of the translatore have followed. P.
has ‘ diripiatur,’ which is the true reading.
It means torn to pieces among the women,
each trying to secure him, as in Persius ii.
37, “ Puellae hunc rapiant ;'’ and Martial
vii. 76, to a parasite who was a favourite
among the rich :

“Quod te diripiunt potentiores
Per convivia, porticus, theatra?

large army into that country, and deposed
the king, Parthamasiris, who was a Par-
thian, and had been placed on the throne
of Armenia by Chosmes, King of Parthia,
expelling the reigning king, Exedares, who
had been king from A.D. 78, and was re-
stored by Trajan, A.D. 106. Lipsius (Epis-
tolicae Quaestiones‚ iv. 20), discussing the
age of Juvenal, infers from this passage
that he lived in the time of Trajan, and
that he here refers tobis expedition. Se-
veral comets are recorded in the reigns
about this time; and Suetonius mentions
one in the reign of Vespasian, on which the
emperor said in jest that it had something
to do with the Parthian king, “Qui capil-
latus essetf' (Vesp. 24.) The particular
allusion, if any, cannot be determined. It
may be to the expedition of Trajan or to
any time before it, but not later, for Ar-
menia did not give the Romans any trouble
for some time after that expedition.

409. quosdam facit, isse Niphaten] Ni-
phates is a range of mountains in Armenia,
part of the range of Taurus. Some of the
Latin poets speak of it as the name of a.
river, and so Juvenal supposed it to be.
(See note on Hor. C. ii. 9. 20, ‘rigidum
Niphaten.') The woman stands at the city
gates, and picks up all sorts of travellers'
lies, about floods and earthquakes in distant
parts, and so forth, and retails them to
every one she meets as the news of the
day. ‘ Facit‚’ ‘ she makes out ;’ part of her
news she invents.

413. Nec tamen z'cl vitium] He says the
gossip is not so bad as the bot-tempered
violent creature who flies into a passion
and gets black in the face with rage if a dog
barks and breaks her rest, and bids the
poor beast and his master be cruelly flogged.
