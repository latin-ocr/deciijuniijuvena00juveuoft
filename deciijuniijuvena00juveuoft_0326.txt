Spectent juvenes, quos clamor et audax

fetched, and proposes ‘praeca’ [Ribbeck
omits vv. 195, 196]

195. mihi paee Immensae] ‘Pace ple-
bis’ is by the leave of the people. Itis
most common in the combinations ‘pace
mea‚' ‘pace tua? but it is used with the
genitive as here and in Ovid, Amor. iii.
2. 60: “Pace loquor Veneris, tu dea
major eris.'’ He asks their leave to abuse
them, for he says in the same breath they
are a huge useless 111011, and care for
nothing but the Circus, as he has said
often before (S. iii. 223, n.).

197. fre-1907· aurem Perculit] He writes
as if he heard the shout proclaiming that
the green faction had won. Τ 110 division
of drivers in the Circus into four parties
who were distinguished by the colour of
their dress has been mentioned above.
The favourite colour‚ which was par-
ticularly patronized it appears by some of
the emperors, was the dark green (pra-
sinus), and Juvenal says he gathers by
the shout that green coat has won3 for
if that eolour failed the whole town would
go into mourning as they did after Cannae.
This was the calamity the Romans felt
most and longest; the consternation at
the time was terrible, as it well might be
(Livy xxii. 53, 54). The consuls defeated
at Cannae were L. Aemilius Paulus and
C. Terentius Varro. Livy, describing the
battle (xxii. 43. 46), says that a wind
arose blowing the dust in the face of the
Romans and blinding them.

sio' here is a wager. He says shouting
and wagering and sitting next to pretty
girls is more fit for the young than him-
self, so he must have been advanced in
life when this was written. ‘Cultae’ is
equivalent to ‘amatae’ ‘ Contracta cuti-
cula' is a dried-up skin. Horace de-
scribes himself as “Corporis exigui, prae-
canum, solibus aptum.” In their houses
the Romans did not wear the toga, but
it was not decent to appear iu public
places without it (S. i. 96, n.). Ruperti
asks, “ Α11 de toga meretricum cogitavit
poeta ?'’ On which Gifford remarks, “ It
will be yet some time before we know the
utmost of which a commentator is capa-
ble.'' He might have seen some eurious
speeimens in the present day.

204. Jam nuncin balnea salva Fronte]
He says⁵ “Although it wants a whole hour
of noon, you may go to the bath without
shame.’' ‘Frons’ is usually put for the
seat of modesty. The usual dinner hour
was the ninth (S. i. 49), and the Romans
commonly bathed an hour before dinner.
But this was on business dayS. The
invitation is for a holiday, and men
might do as they pleased without being
afraid of seeming idle (Becker's Gallus,
Exc. 011 the Baths, towards the end).
He says it would not do, however, to
begin bathing so early every day of the
feast, which lasted six days, for even such
a luxurious life as that would become very
wearxsome.
