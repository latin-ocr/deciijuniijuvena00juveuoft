41. spirant opobalsama] ‘ Spirnre' is
commonly used with respect to perfumes‚ 115
Vir-gil (Aen. i. 407): “Ambrosiaeque comae
divinum vertice odorem Spirax'ere.'’ ‘Opo-
balsammn’ is the juice (ὀπός) of the ‘ bal-
samum ' (amyris Gileadensis), the bahn of
Gilead mentioned 111 Scriptum, of which 11
correct description is given by Pliny, H. N.
xii. 25. He says that its scent was preferred
to every other; and he gives the 5111119 ae-
count that Bruce the traveller gives of the
extraction of the juice by an incision in the
bark, and how it was collected in very small
quant-ities, so that it took a lonfr summer's
d· ·11· to fill a small bottle. It 11115 therefore
very rare and costlx, as it is still. There
was a tax upon the tree Pliny 51115 ss. c. ):

“Sei-xit nunc haec et tributa pendit eum
sua gente.’'

43. Quod si vexantur Ieyes aejura,] ‘If
you are to disturb laws that have gone to
rest, you should call up the Scantinia)
⁶ Citare,’ a form of ‘ cie0‚' means here ‘to
wake up,' alluding to ‘dormis' (v. 37). The
‘lex Scantinia’ was a law for the suppres-
sion of unnatural crimes. Domitian did
revive this law, according to Suetonius :
“ Quosdam ex utroque ordine (equites and
senators) lege Scantinia contlemnavit” (c. 8).
In a large number of the MSS. the read-
iugis ‘Scatinial Thislaw existed in Cicero's
time. The penalty of death was 111-5131111-
posed on these crimes by the Christian em—
perors Constantine and Constans. As to
‘leges et jura,’ see below, v. 7 2, n.; and for
the distinction between them the render 15·
referred to Smith’s Dict. Ant. and to Hor.
Epp. i. 16. 41, 11. [Ribbeck has ‘lcges, at
jure citari.’]

45. faciunt 1ιὶ plura :] It seems as if
Juvenal remembered that line of Horace
(A. P. v. 432), “Et faciunt hi plura dolenti-

bus.'' ‘ J unctaeque umbone phalanges ' 15
expressed by the Greek military term συν-
ασπισμὺς, 11111911 uas the clos est order of the
phalanx in chaiging: or it represents in
the Roman 1111111119 the‘ testudo‚' or inter-
lacing of shields, which formed the most

effectual shelter against the darts and other
missiles of the enemy. The ‘ umbo‚' 01·
ὀμφαλὸς, was the boss 111 the centre of the
‘clipeus’ or ‘parma‚' which helped to throw
off the darts that struck the shield, and
being furnished with a spike, or else by its
own projection‚ was itself a weapou of of-
fence. So Μαι-1111151115 (iii.46): “Inturbam
incideris, cunctos umbone repellet.” The
Scholiast quotes Lucan: “ Quicquid multis
peccatur inultum est.''

47. Mayna inter molleseoneordia] John
of Salisbury quotes this (Nugae, &c. iii. 12)
011 the question whether frieudship 91111 exist
between the bad, which he decides in the.
negative, and goes on, “Magna utique inter
molles et malos concordia, sed ea tantum a
caritate discedit quantum lux distat a tene-
bris.'' ‘Molles' are effeminate, in the worst
sense.

51. Numquid nos aqimus causas‚] She
SayS, ‘ Do we meddle with men’s business
as they do with ours.' Horace 11115 (8. i. 9.
38) z “ Interemn si Aut valeo stare aut novi
civilia jnra.'' For the component parts of
‘Jus Civile,' which included things human
and things divine, see Dict. Ant. Art.
‘Jus;' and v. 72, 11.

52. sora vestra] There were several ‘fora'
in Rome atthis time; but the three in which
most legal business was donc were the Fo-
rum Romanum. Forum Juliuun, and Forum
Augusti. The last is particularly referred
to in the last satire (v. 128), and was that
iu which most judicial business was trans-
acted.
