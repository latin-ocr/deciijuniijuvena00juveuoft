SATIRA X.

Ilaesuri saxis cinerum custodibus, ad quae.

Discutienda valent sterilis mala robora ficus:

145

Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulcris.
Expende Hannibalem; quot libras in (luce summo
Invenies? hie est quem non capit Africa Mauro

- Percussa Oceano Niloque admota tepenti,

Rursus ad Aethiopum populos altosque elephantos.

Additur imperiis Hispania: Pyrenaeum

Transilit : opposuit natura Alpemque nivemque;

Diducit scopulos et montem rumpit aceto.

J am tenet Italiam ; tamen ultra pergere tendit :
“Actum‚” inquit, “ nihil est, nisi Poeno milite portas 155
Frangimus et media vexillum pono Suburra.”

O qualis facies et quali digna tabella,

Quum Gaetula ducem portaret bellua luseum !

her rewards, aud yet these very rewards,
which are won by only a few, and the strug-
gle teget them, are at times the ruin of
men's country. ‘Olim’ is an indefinite
adverb of time either past or future. Ho-
race has

“ Parentis olim si quis impia manu
Senile guttur fregerit,
Edit cicutis allium nocentius.'’
(Epod. iii. 1.)

(See S. vi. 42, n.‚ and note on Hor. C. ii.
145.)sterilis mala robora ficum] The
wild fig, ‘caprificus,¹ was common among
the tombs. Canidia among other things
bids her attendants bring “sepulcris ca-
prificos erutas ’' (Hor. Epod. v. 17). See
note on Persius, S. i. 25, and Martial x. 2 :
“ Marmora Messalae findit caprificus-'¹
[Compare Pausanias (ix. 33. 7), who saw
at Alaleomenae a huge ivy which had sepa-
rated the joints of the stones in a temple,

and was tearing the stones asunder.]

146. Quandoquidem daea sunt] Heinrich
thinks this a feeble verse and not genuine;
a superfluous moral. I think he is wrong,
and that the verse or something like it is
wanted. Propertius (iii. 2. 19) has

‘⁴ Nec Mausolei dives fortuna sepulcri
Mortis ab extrema conditione vacatfl’

147. Expende Hannibalem ;] If you put
Hannibal in the scales, how much will this
great general weigh Ρ He says below (v.
172) nothing but death declares how very
small are the bodies of men. Juvenal does
not speak of weighing his “ ambition and

fate or rather his ashes ’' (Ruperti), but
himself. ‘ Non capit’ means is not large
enough to hold. ‘Rursus’ is ‘in the
rear,' ‘re—versus,' not “again, in another
directim, extending, &c.'' (Mayor.) '

151. Additur imperiis Hispania :] The
conquest of Hispania by the Carthaginians
was begun by Hamilcar, Hannibal’s father.
and Hannibal nearly completed it by the
taking of Saguntum, B.c. 219. 111 that
year he declared war against Rome, and in
13.c. 218 he crossed the Pyrenees, having
first subdued the tribes between the Iberus
(Ebro) and those mountains. He com·
menced his march in the spring, but did
not reach the Alps till late in the autumn,
after the snow had begun to fall. lee
story of the vinegar is in Livy, xxi. c. 37.

155. Actum, inquit, nihil πῄ] This ex-
presses well the object of his whole life ;
all his successes would go for nothing if he
failed to enter Rome in triumph. See
S. vii. 161, n. As to ‘ Suburra’ see iii. 5, n.

157. O qualis facies] “Oh‚ what a
beautiful picture he would have made, a
one-eyed general riding on his ele-
phant!”‘ Hannibal got ophthalmia and
lost one of his eyes 1³.c. 217, in the marshes
south of the Po (Livy xxii. 2). Juvenal
seems to have had Livy's words before
him: “Ipse Hannibal aeger oculis, ex
verna primum intemperie variante calores
frigoraque, elephanto qui unus supersue-
rat quo altius ab aqua exstaret vectus:
vigiliis tandem et nocturno humore palus-
trique eaelo gravante caput, et quia me-
dendi nec locus nec tempus erat, altero
oculo cnpitur.''
