Qui multas facies fingit cito : sufiiciunt haee,

Quando ego pauper ero.

Votum miserabile, nec spes

bc right. He says he wants two beai-ers to
carry him to the Circus and keep him safc
from the crowd, through which he must
make his way himself it· he walketl. If he
were a rich man he would have besides his

the‘familia urbana,' among the slavos called
generally ‘ literati,' wealthy Romans had va-
rious artists among whom were ‘caelatores,'
chasers in silver, and ‘ servi ab imaginibus‚'

for when Ι pray to Fortune she stops her
ears with wax, like the crew of Ulysses when
they passed the island of the Sirenes.
Ulysses, by the advice of Circe, stopped
his men's ears that they might not hear
the song of these charmers (Odyss. xii.
173, sqq.). Homer places them m an island
in the straits of Messina ς and so Juvenal
speaks of ‘ Siculos cantus.' [P., Jahn, and
Ribbeck have ‘ pingit,' in place of ‘ fingit?
There is also a reading ‘ pingat.']

SATIRA X.

INTRODUCTION.

TnoUGn this satire takes general ground, the subject it treats of is brought home by
examples and the mode of treatment to the generation in which it was written. In
this respect as well as in caustic power, in brilliancy of lang-uage, in variety as well as
originality, it is superior to the poem written in imitation of it by Dr. Johnson, and
through which it is best known to the majority of English readers. The graphio and
dramatic passage on the fortunes of Sejanus is tamely represented by the corresponding
example of Wolsey 3 and the description of Charles of Sweden is a heavy substitute for
that of Hannibal. No description of an imbecile old age ever came near that which is
contained in this satire, and the pictures of Priam's death as it might have been and as
it was are scenes which might be transferred to canvas. The language of Nestor at
his son's funeral is very mournful. The serious lines at the end, though the thoughts
they contain are not all original, are in J uvenal's best style, which is better than
Horace's in dealing with grave subjects in serious language, as it is the style of a man
in earnest, an impression which Juvenal always conveyS, but Horace seldom. The
relation of man to God is truly stated in the words ‘ Carior est illis homo qnam sibi ς’
and the vigour of a manly beart is excellently described in half a dozen lines, ‘ Fortem
posce animum,' διο. .

The subject of the satire is the vanity of human wishes, which are seldom conceived
in a reasonable spirit, and are generally shortsighted and impulsive, if not in themselves
