LIFE 01¹* JUVENAL. xvii

away, for it was written shortly after the consulship of Junius, und
therefore, if Sabinus be the man, in the middle ortowards the beginning
of Domitian's reign. But it will be shown below that the lmuislunent
could not have happened till late in Domitian's reign, and I believe
Hadrian's consul, «Iunius Rusticus, is meant, and that the Satire was
written early in Hadrian‘s reign, that is about AJ). 121, or two years
after the consulship ofJunius Β.

In Sat. xiii. 17 hc speaks of Calvinus, the friend hc addresscs, a<
then sixty years old, and born in the consulship of Fonteius, I think
it almost certain that the consul referred to is L. Fonteius Capito, eos.
A.D. 59, and that therefore the Satire was written towards the bc-
ginning of Hadrian's reign, and not earlier than ΑΛ). 119.

The earlier date to which Lipsius and others refer it, as stated in my
note (xiii. 17), is forty-seven years before the reign of Hadrian.
Either, therefore, Juvenal did not write at all in that reign, or this
Satire was written while· Hadrian was emperor, about Α.1). 119.
Otherwise Juvenal’s Satires must range over a period of fifty years or
thereabouts‚ and one of the very best must have been nearly the earliest.
Those who are of opinion that the allusion to Meroe in v. 163 of this
Satire‚ resulted from personal observation‚ must be prepared to admit
the later date, or to suppose that the banishment of Juvenal to Egypt
by Domitian is altogether fabulous, and that his visit to that country
must have been early in the reign of Vespasian, if not before it, since
the Satire, according to the other hypothesis, must have been written
about the fourth year of that reign, and nine years before Domitian
became emperor.

Thus the sixth, seventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth Satires have internal
evidences by which they may be referred to the reign of Hadrian, and
of these the three last, I have no doubt, were written under that
emperor. .

But if we take A.D. 120 as the latest date of which there is evidence,
how far back may we go to determine the author’s age Ρ

It is nearly certain that the first Satire was written in Trajan’s reign,
not long after the banishment of Marius Priscus, ΑΛ). 100.

sse reference to war on the Euphrates in the eighth Satire (v. 51)

makes it probable that the poem was written during the Armenian and
Parthian wars (AJ). 114—116), in the course of which (aa). 115)

⁸ Ruperti, 1 think, is right in saying “ Satira xv. hoc forte anno scripta (121) non
superiore, nam si tam recens factum essct quod in ea narrat, poeta opinor v. 27 simpli-
citer dixisset ‘nuper‚' neque adjecisset ¹ Consule J unio ’ '’ (Vita J uv. per annos digesta,
vol. i. p. xxx). This commentator thinks that Juvenal, now in his eighty-first· year, was
suspected of having written Satire vii. against Hadrian, and was banishcd by him.
Poor old man!
