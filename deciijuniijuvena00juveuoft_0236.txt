D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Institor hibernae tegetis niveique cadurci,
Dummodo non pereat mediae quod noctis ab hora
Sedisti qua nemo faber, qua nemo sederet

Qui docet obliquo lanam deducere ferro 3

Dummodo non pereat totidem olfecisse lucernas

225

Quot stabant pueri, quum totus decolor esset
Flaccus et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.
Rara tamen merces quae cognitione tribuni

Non egeat.

Sed vos saevas imponite legeS‚
Ut praeceptori verborum regula constet,

230

Ut legat historias, auctores noverit omnes,
Tanquam ungues digitosque suos3 ut forte rogatus,
Dum petit aut thermas aut Phoebi balnea, dicat

is a parody of Anicetus, Nero's ‘paeda-
gogusss a man of the worst character. The
‘paedagogus’ here acts as ‘dispensator,'
paymaster (see i. 91, 11.). ‘Aera’ is used
for the teacher's fee by Horace, “Ibant
octonis referentes Idibus aera '³ (S. i. 6.
75, 11.). The MSS. vary between ‘ frangit‚'
‘franget‚’ and ‘frangat' [Ribbeck 1135
‘ franoat '] .

22? Institor hibernae teyetis] He ad-
vises Palaemon to let the man take a slice
off his fee, rather than lose the whole of
what he has sat up night after night to
earn. ‘Institor’ is a shopman “qui ta-
bernae locove ad emendum vendendumve
praeponitur, quique sine loco ad cundem
actum praeponitur '’ (Dig. 14. 3. 18. See
note on Hor. C. iii. 6. 30: “seu vocat
institor ³³). As to ‘ tegetis ’ see S. vi. 117,
11. ‘Cadurcum' is also a quilt, but of
linen, the name being derived as is pro-
bable from the Cadurci, a peoplc of Gallia,
who wovc linen eloth. The word is used
above, vi. 537.

222. Dummodo non pereat] Providcd
only you lose not altogether the trifle for
which you sit from midnight in such an
atmosphere as no blacksmith or weaver
would stay in. ‘ Sedisti ¹ 1135 the force of
the aorist, and means ‘are wont to sit.'
‘ Obliquo ferro ³ is the carding instrument,
consisting of crooked bits of iron fastened
in a board. ‘Deducere,’ ‘trahere’ are
usual words for this process. See S. ii.
54, n.

225. olfecisse lucernas] Boys going
to school at night carried lanterns with
them 3 and he says the master had to bear
the smell of as many lamps as there were
boys, aud their books were black with the

smoke. The works of Horace came to be a
1111ξό ἓξὲξ, as he foretold they would (Epp.

“ Hoc quoque te manet ut pueros elementa
docentem
Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.”

228. quae coym'tione tribuni] He says
the man cannot get his fee, except 011 rare
occasions, without summoning the father
before the tribunus. What authority for
the administration of justice the tribunus
plebis had under the empire Ι do not
know. Under the republic he had none,
directly at least. There seems to have been
an appeal from the praetor to the tribuni
in some cases (see Cic. pro Quint. c· 7 3
pro Tullio, e. 38).

229. Sed vos saevas imponite lege-⁵3] Hc
says to all fathers that they ought to make
the strictest conditions with teachers that
they should speak grammatically, and have
history at their fingers' end, so that at any
unexpccted moment they may be able to
tell who was Anchises' nurse and so forth.

230. verborum regula constet,] This
means that his constructions should be cor-
rect (“ Servata semper lege et ratione 10-
quendi,’' S. vi. 453). ‘Omnes ³ belongs to
‘ historias ' as well as ‘auctores'

233. Phoebi balnea,] The Scholiast says
these were ‘privatae balneae,' and no more
can be said. The historical questions these
poor teachers are to answer are not un-
paralleled in some modern examinations.
The Scholiast thought he knew the name
of Anehiscs' nurse, and says it was Tisi-
phone3 perhaps he jested. There was an
Archemorus also named Opheltes. His
mother-'S name was Eurydice, and his
