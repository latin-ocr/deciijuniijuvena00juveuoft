SATIRA IV. 4⁰9

Fert animus calidae fecisse silentia turbae
Majestate manus: quid deinde loquere? ‘ Quirites,
Hoc puto non justum est; illud male, rectius illud)

Scis etenim justum gemina suspendere lance

lo

Ancipitis librac; rectum discernis ubi inter

Curva subit, vel cum fallit pede regula varo,

Et potis es nigrum vitio praefigere theta.

Quin tu igitur summa nequicquam pelle decorus

Ante diem blando caudam jactare popello 15
Desinis, Anticyras melior sorbere meracas?

Quae tibi summa boni est? “ Uncta vixisse patella
Semper, et assiduo curata cuticula sole.'’

Exspecta ; haud aliud respondeat 11300 311115.

does not name, “O multum ante alias in-
felix littera theta.''

14. Quin tu igitur] He goes on (as
if the youth had disclaimcd all that he
ironically attributes to him), “Then why
do you not leave off showing your fine
tail (like a peacock) before your time to
the flatteriug vulgar, you who are only
fair on the surface, you who had better
go and swallow all Anticyra without
water ?‘'’

44, sq.) :

“Sed videt hune omnis domus et vicinia
Inffgsgm turpem, speciosum pelle de-
cora.

‘Ante diem’ is before he has qualified
himself. ‘Popello' is the contemptuous
form of ‘populns’ used by Horace (Epp.
i. 7. 65), “Vilia vendentem tunicato scruta
popello.” See below, S. vi. 50. As to
Anticyra see J nv. xiii. 97. Horace speaks
of three Anticyrae (A. P. 300, “tribus
Anticyris caput insanabile nunquam'’),
but there is no more meaning in the
plural there than here (500 11010). As to

‘1 ιέξ13035’ compare Horace, Epp. ii. 2.

“ Expulit helleboro morbum bilemque me-
1300,

Horace says of one (Epp. i. 16.

Ε1 101111 311 sese.”

‘ Uncta’ is a common epithet for 1131111105,
made—dishes. See S. iii. 102; vi. 16. .
]8. assiduo curata cuticula sola] ‘ Pel-
liculam' or ‘cutem curare’ are common
phrases with Horace, as 111 S. ii. 5. 38;
Epp. i. 2. 29; i. 4. 15. Itis an expression
for taking care of oneself, generally in 1110
way of eating and drinking. And so it

I nunc,

is here. The man liked a good dinner,
which in the winter he would take in a
room that caught the sun's ruys, as in
summer in one looking to the north. Sec
note on Hor. C. ii. 15. 14: “nulla decem-
pedis Metata privatis opacam Porticus
excipiebat Arcton.” For the former the
Romans had the words ‘insolatio‚' ‘apri-
catio: for the latter the phrase was
‘ coenatio ad Boream? Juv. xi. 203 has
“Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula
solem.’' ⁸

19. Exspecta ,· haud aliud] ‘ Exspecta'
is ‘ wait a moment‚' or ‘look here.' It was
a way of interrupting a speaker, especially
when they had something disagreeable to
say. Socrates adds, “This old woman
here could give no worse answer than
that.’' ‘ Haec ' is as if pointing to an old
woman hard by, whom he calls Baucis.
‘ I nunc' is a contemptuous way of speak-
ing, common in Horace and Juvenal. See
Hor. Epp. i. 6. 17; ii. 2. 76, and Juv. x.
110, 11. ‘suffla’ is ‘ spout out' or some-
thing of that sort. His counsellor tells
him he may now, after his admission, go
and boast of being the sou of Dinomache
(who was of the family of the Alcmaeoni-
dae) and of his beauty, if only he admits
that old ragged Baucis is as wise as he,
when she cries her herbs for some rascally
slave to buy. ‘ Pannuceus’ is synonymous
with ‘ pannosus? Baucis is a Greek 1131110
commonly used for old slaves. ‘ Ocimum '
is a herb described by Pliny (H. N. xviii.
16). But it is 1101 known what plant he
11103115. ‘Bene’ is used as above, S. i. 111,
and as Horace occasionally uses ‘male'
(C. i. 17. 25, ‘¹ ne male dispari Inconti-
nentes injiciat manus,'’ where see note).
As to ‘discincto ' see S. iii. 31, 11.
