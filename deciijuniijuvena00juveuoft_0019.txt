INTRODUCTION.

LIFE OF JUVENAL.

- ΤΗΕ character of Horace's mind was such, that his own experience and
the events of his life come naturally into his wrifings, and a tolerably
full and accurate biography of that poet has been gathered from his own
pen. His poems form a gallery of contemporary porti-aits, including his
own picture in every stage of life. It is not so with Juvenal. He had
to deal with vice and folly more than a century older than the vice and
folly of Horace’s day, and a tyranny which Horace never witnessed.
The playful personalities of Horace did not suit Juvenal's subject, and
would not have represented his way of viewing it 3 nor did they suit the
severe and defiant spirit in which he approached it. The consequence
is that the traces of Juvenal’s life in his satires are very slight.

There are several ancient biographies to be found in various MSS. of
the Satires, one of which is generally supposed to be older than the
rest. It is not uncommonly supposed to have been written by the
grammarian Probus ¹, but it is published among the memoirs attributed
to Suetonius, It may be a fragment taken from Suetonius' life of the
poet. The following is a translation of that memoir, according to the
most probable version of the text 2--

the pantomimu5‚ and a poet of his, who was puffed up with his palti-y six
months’ military rank, he took pains to perfect himself in this kind of
writing. And yet for a very long time he did not venture to trust
any thing even to a small audience. But after a while he was heard by
