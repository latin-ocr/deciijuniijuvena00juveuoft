78 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 75. The word is given; Pegasus first snatchcs up his cloak, the new-made bailiff of
the city, for what else then were praefects? an excellent judge, but much too merciful
for the times he lived in. Pleasant old Crispus next, whose hcart was like his speech,
a man of gentle temper : an excellent companion for the world's master if he might
spcak his honest mind. But who dare speak to such a tyrant, when on every trivial
sentence hung one's life? Crispus was not the man to swim against the stream, and
risk his life for truth. And so he lived 111 safety eighty years. 'l'hen came Acilius
with his poor son, unworthy of that savage death. But greatness aud great age have
long been strangers. Let me be humble brother of the giants. In vain he pierced
the bear in the Alban circus. Who does not see through such patrieian tricks ’1)
Brutus might cheat your king with a long beard. Rubrius comes next, not less de-
jectcd though less noble ,- convicted of au old aud foul ofl'ence, but shameless as the
filthy satirist. Montanus next with his big belly eomeS. Crispinus with his morning
scents: Pompeius too, whose softest whisper was a dagger: Fuscus, who dreamt of wars
111 1115 marble villa, and kept his bowels for the Dacian vultures. Crafty Veiento then,
and blind Catullus who lusted for a maid he could not see ; a special monster even for
our times, fit but to beg by the road side. He matches all in admiration, looking to
the left while the brute lay 011 1115 right ς just as he did in the theatre, praising the
fighters and maehinery. Veiento like a madman prophesies. “ Here is an omen of
huge triumph 3 some king shall be your prisoner 3 dou't you see the brute’s a foreigner?”
Fabricius could all but tell the animal's country and its age.

V. 130. “ Well now, what think ye, is it to be eut ?’' “ N ay‚'' says Montanus, “far be
such disgrace. Let's get a noble dish to put it in ς Prometheus too to make it ,ς haste,
clay and wheel 3 heuceforth, O Caesar, potters must wait upon your court !” His
motion was adopted, worthy of a man who knew the ways of Nero's court, no one
has beat him in my time for knowledge of the table.
an oyster came from, and told at sight the echinus' native coast.

V. 144. The couneil rise and are discharged 3 summoned in haste, as if some terrible
news had come from far. Would that in trifles such as these had passed the savage
days 111 which he robbed the city of her noblest spirits, without a hand to avenge
them. But his time came when the mean began to fear him. ’Twas this that ruined
him, though his hand reeked with noble blood.

ECCE iterum Crispinus, et est mihi saepe vocandus
Ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemptum

A vitiis, aeger solaque libidine fortis :

Delicias viduae tantum aspernatur adulter.

He'd tell you at a taste where ⁸

He says he must often call in this monster
to play his part (ad partes sustinendas).
Ovid has (Epp. ex Ponto, 111. 1. 41) z

“ thue juvent alii tu debes vincere amieos,
Uxor, et ad partes prima venire tuas.’'

As the Scholiast says, the metaphoris taken
from the stage. ‘Redemptum' is ‘redeemed
from infamy‚' as it were from slavery. So
M. Seneca, speaking of the orator Haterius,
after mentioning his faults of style, says,
“Redimebat tamen vitia virtutibus et plus
habebat quod laudares quam quod ignos-
ceres.'' (Excerpt. Contr. lib. iv. praef. fin.)

‘Aeger’ means that he was feeble, ‘fortis,'
resolute. (See Hor. C. S. 23, n.) “Fortis
ut quem nullus potest a consuetis vitiis de-
terrere.’' Schol. He is said to have had no
taste for inti-iguing with single women, and
was only satisfied with corrupting those
who were married. The Scholiast says he
was ‘⁶ iu minore debilis scelere.'' ‘Vidua'
applies to women without husbands, whether
they ever had oue or not. Livy (i. 46) op-
poses it to ‘ coelebs.' In v. 3, Ρ. has
“ aegrae solaque libidine fortes Deliciae,
viduas.’' And the Scholiast, according to
the common reading of his text, has the
following note: “Aey. solaque lib. sor.
