Maturus bello, Armeniae Syriaeque tuendis

Amnibus et Rheno atque Istro.
Mitte ostia, Cacsar,

Securum valet haec aetas.

Invenies aliquo cum percussore jacentem,
Pei-mixtum nautis ct furibus ac fugitivis,

Et resupinati cessantia tympana Galli.
Aequa ibi libertas, communia pocula, lectus
Non 311115 cuiquam, nec mensa remotior ulli.
Quid facias talem sortitus, Pontice, servum?

Nempe in Lucanos aut Tusca ergastula mittas.

sun off. The shops were open then, as they
commonly are now. (See note on Hor.
Epp. i. 7. 50.) The ‘linteum ’ had a sign
or a name on it (inscripta). ‘ Inscripta ' is
the 531118 as ‘ picta,' ‘elnbroidcred.' It is
not so used elsewhere.

The Germans on the Rhiue and the Scy-

petual sources of trouble to the Romans.
He says at the age when this man is wast-
ing his life he might be serving in the army
and protecting the empire. He uses Nero's
name generically for the emperor of the day,

uncertain. [Jahn and Ribbeck point thus ε

is better. ‘ Ostia ' standing alone would be
intelligible in that sense, but not in 1118
other. ‘ Butss says he, ‘ you must seek

‘ J acentem ’ means ‘ lying at table.' As to
‘ carnifices’ see vi. 480: “ suut quae 101-

were common biers, on which poor people
were carried out to burial. See note on
