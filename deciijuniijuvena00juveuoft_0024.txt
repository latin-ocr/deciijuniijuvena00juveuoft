xviii INTRODUCTION.

Armenia was finally subdued by Trajan. In v. 120 the same Marius
is referred to as having ‘ nupcr' strippcd thc Africans. But ‘ nuper ⁷ is
used with much latitude, and the name of Marius was long held in
remcmhrancc as the great spoiler of provianS, having been made more
notorious through the cclebrity of Tacitus the historian and Pliny the
younger, who were employed to prosecute him, just as the speeches of
Burke and Shcridan against WVarren Hastiugs have perpetuated and
spread the ill-fame of his Indian government.

It is certain that the fourth Satire was written after the death of
Domitian, A.D. 96, since his death is expressly mentioned in the last two
verses. This Satire therefore may be assigned to the reign of Nerva
from September, A.D. 96, to January, ΑΛ). 98, or very early in his suc-
cessor Trajan's reign. The subject would only amuse soon after the
tyrant's death.

The twelfth Satire, which refers to Trajan's basin in the Portus
Augusti (v, 75, δια), must have been written in his reign or after it.
This argument assumes what there is no good reason to doubt, that the
Scholiast is right in attributing this work to Trajan ⁹.

According to these calculations eight ont of the sixteen Satires were
written after the death of Domitian. The sixteenth is a fragment, and
it may be admitted that, if not the last written, it was not begun very
long before the last, whichever that may have been. Thus more than
half the extant Satires were written, as I suppose, between A.D. 96 and
ΑΛ). 120, or some of them possibly a little later, a period of at least
twenty-four years.

If any credit is due to the statement of the Glammarians, in which
they all agree, that Juvenal did not begin to write in this style till he
was near middle life, we may suppose that none of the Satires were
written much before the death of Domitian. We cannot tell how long
the vigorous spirit that appears in all these poems may last, and show
itself in compositions of this sort. It is no argument to say that Horace
soon got tired of Satire. His mind and circumstances were very diffe-
rent from Juvenal’s. But twenty-four years after the period of middle
life carries a man on to an age when, under almost any circumstances,
the mind loses its fi‘eshness and seeks rest, at least from the excitement
of such compositions3 and I think Juvenal could not have been more
than forty, and probably not so much, when Domitian died. This may
be affirmed whether the Grammarians have stated the truth on the
above point or not, if my calculations are not altogether wrong. This

⁹ Cramer (Italy, ii. 14) thinks the Scholiast has confounded this work with the har-
hour of Centumcellae (civita Vecehia), which was constructed by Trajan5 but Sir W.

Gen (Rome and its Vicinity, ii. 175, sqq.) and other scholars entertain no doubt of this
basin too being Trajan's.
