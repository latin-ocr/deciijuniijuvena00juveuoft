Optima sed quare Caesennia teste marito?

Inde faces ardent, veniunt a dote sagittae.

Rescribat: vidua est locuples quae nupsit avam.
Cur desiderio Bibulae Sertorius ardet?

Si verum excutias, facies non uxor amatur ι

Tres rugae subeant et se cutis arida laxet,

Fiant obscuri dentes oculique minores,

“ Collige sarcinulas‚'' dicet libertus, “ et exi 3

pomanes‚’ see below, v. 616, where he re-
sumes the subject. At present he passes on
to another, that of the tyranny of rich and
pretty wives, Horace speaks of that as a
happy state of society in which “matre
carentibus Privignis mulier temperat inno-
cens ” (C. iii. 24. 17). [Ribbeck omits
v. 133—135.]

136. Optima sed quare] He supposes
one to ask, if all women are so bad, why
some husbands seem to love their wives;
why forinstance Caesennia's husband counts
her the best of women Ρ The answer is, that
she brought him a large portion. ‘ Bis quin-
genta ’ is equivalent to ‘decies sestertium?
ten hundred thousand sesterces, not much
less than 8000& of our money ; that is the
price at which he calls her chaste. The
arrows of his love and the torch of Venus
with him are in his wife's money. Horace
refers to the tyranny of rich wives, C. iii.
24. 19, where, describing the blessings of
rude life, he says,

“Nec dotata regit virum
Conjux nec nitido fidit adultero.'’

Other examples will be found there. The
round number here given is repeated in
S. x. 335, “ritu decies centena dabuntur
Antiquo,'’ and in the epigram of Martia]
(ii. 65) quoted on the above place of Ho-
race, and in Tacitus (Ann. ii. 86). “Et
Caesar quamvis posthabitam (Agrippae fi-
liam) decies sestertii dote solatus est‚”
where Lipsius says that this was the
usual portion among rich people. But
it is plainly only put conventionally‚
as ‘quadringenta sestertia' is above (ii.
117). The bow and torch of Cupid

are3gifen to his mother by Ovid (Heroid.
11. ε ·

“ Per Venerem nimiumque mihi facientia
tela,
Altera tela arcuS, altera tela faces.”

Caesennia is the name of a noble Etrurian
family. Some MSS. have Caesonia, which
name appears in v. 616 of this satire. The
other is right.

140. Libertas emitur:] She buys her
freedom with her portion. She is at liberty
to do what she likes to her paramour,
answer his letters or any thing else. She
is an unmarried woman (vidua) for any
allegiance she shows to her husband.

143. Si verum exaustas] On the pri-
mary meaning of ‘ excutere ' and ‘concu-
tere: which is used in the same way, see
note on Hor. S. i. 3. 35, and Long's note
on Cic. con. Rull. ii. 23. It means ‘ to
search out.’

145. obscuri] See v. 131, n.

146. Colliye sarcinula-53] This word is
explained on iii. 160. The Lex J ulia de
Adulteriis provided that there should be
present on the occasion of a divorce seven
witnesses, besides a freedman of the person
making the divorce (see Long²s Article ‘ Di-
vortium ² in Smith's Diet. Ant). This ex-
plains ‘dicet libertus 3' it was the freedman
who declared the divorce in the name of the
husband or wife, whichever it might be, for
either party could divorce the other. This
practice became extremely common under
the Empire‚ and for the most trifling causes.
The wife was entitled to her ‘ dos ’ unless
some grave fault could be proved against

lgeri< in which case she only got part of it
