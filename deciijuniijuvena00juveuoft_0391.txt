SATIRA XV.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms satire must have been written after J uvenal’s residence in Egypt. Under what
circumstances he wentto that country there is not sufficient authority for sayingwith any
certainty. In v. 27 there is an allusion which gives fair ground for supposing that the
poem was written in the reign of Hadrian (see note). It turns upon a case said to have
happened not long before. The people of Ombi (v. 35), a town in Upper Egypt, wor-
shipped the crocodilo, while those of Tentyra (nearly a hundred miles lower down the
Nile) were opposed to that worship, and were particularly distinguished for their skill and
com-age in killing the crocodile. This caused a fcud between the two peoples, and while
the Ombites were celebrating a religious festival the Tentyrites came and attacked them.
The Ombites were put to flight, and the Tentyrites are represented as having caught one
of them and in their fury having caten him up. This story gives occasion for a good deal
of strong contemptuous writing against the Egyptian3‚ their religion and morals, a vivid
description of the above savage scene, set off by some fine lines on the more tender
instincts of human nature, and the ties of sympathy that unite mankind. Τὴθ principal
subject is revolting, and it was not possible to make it one of general interest. It seems
asif the story, whether true or not, had been repeated to Juvenal and had called up all
the prejudices a residence among these people had created in his mind. His power in
sketching soenes from real life has been seen in the course of these Satires, and here we
have a picture on a larger scale drawn with a strong and rough hand, such as nearly all
his pictures show.

The Satire is addressed to Volusius Bithynicus, whoever he may have been. Perhaps
he is no more than a name.

ARGUMENT.

All know, Volusius, the monsters Egypt worships3 here 'tis the crocodile, the ibis there;
the long-tailed ape at Thebes where Memnon strikes his lyre. Cats, river-5511, and dogs
(but not Diana). Onions and leeks no tooth may barm. Ο holy people, whose gods
grow in their gardens! A sheep or goat they may not eat, but human flesh they
may. When once Ulysses told such marvellous tales to Alcinous and his guests, some
more sober than the rest no doubt were wroth and would have thrown him into the
sea, with his tales about Laestrygones and Cyclops. His Scylla and his clashing rocks
