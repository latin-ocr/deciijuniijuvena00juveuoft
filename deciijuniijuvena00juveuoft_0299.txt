SATIRA X.

Ad Phialen : tantum artificis valet halitus oris,
Quod steterat multis in carcere fornicis annis.

Ut vigeant sensus animi, ducenda tamen sunt

2⁴0

Funera natorum, rogus aspiciendus amatae

Conjugis et fratris plenaeque sororibus urnae.
Haec data poena diu viventibus, ut renovata
Semper clade domus multis in luctibus inque

Perpetuo moerore et nigra veste senescant.

Rex Pylius, magno si quidquam credis Homero,
Exemplum vitae fuit a cornice secundae.

Felix nimirum, qui tot per secula mortem
Distulit atque suos jam (lextra computat annos

Quique novum toties mustum bibit.

Oro parumper 250

Attendas, quantum de legibus ipse queratur
Fatorum et nimio de stamine, quum videt acris

appears to have exheredated his children,
and his property to have passed by the
testamenta to Phiale. lf this is not the
meaning, and the writer of the satire sup-
poses the old fellow simply to say that hc
gives nothing to his children, then in the
language of the Roman law ‘inutiliter tes·
tabitur ;' as to the exact force of which
term the lawyers at one time were not
agroed (Gaius i. 123). But as the property
is said to pass to Phiale, we must assume
that the man had disinherited his children
iu due form. (See note on S. i. 55, and
Long's articles ‘Heres' and ‘Testamew
tum ' in Dict. Ant.) There is an obscene
allusion in ‘tantum artificis‚’ δίο. ‘Car-
oere fornicis ’ is at the entrance of the
brothel, where women exposed themselves
(vi. 121). Ruperti recommends ‘ codiee
scaevo‚' a stupid reading found in one

240. Ut vigeant sensus animi,] But sup-
pose he keeps his faculties, still he must see
all he loves dying before him. These lines
too are very forcible. [P. and Ribbeck have
‘sint'

247.]a cornice secundae] Nestor is next
to the crow. Horace has a woman who is
as old aud Martia! one that is older than
the crows (x. 67). See note on Hor. C. iv.
13. 24: “ Servatnra diu parem Cornicis
vetulae temporibus Lycen.” The place in
Homer is 11. i. 250. The number of ages
is three. By ‘ dextra computat annos ¹ he
iqeans that he was above a hundred years
o

dred on the fingers of the left hand, ancl

age. It was usual to count up to a hun-'

then to begin with the right. In the An-
thology there is an epigram on a garrulous
old lady who was as fresh as a girl, but her
years were such that she had got back to

her lest hand ι she must have been in her
third century.

ἦ πολίη κροτάφοισι Κυτύτταγις, ἡ πολύ-
γρζιιὲεξοςδι’ ἣν Νέστωρ οὐκέτι πρεσβύ-
ἡ φάσοῖτῖἆέρήσαθ ἐλάφου πλέον, ἡ χερὶ

(Brunck, Anal. vol. ii. p. 160.)

‘ Mustum' is new unfermented wine, which
would be drunk in autumn. He only means
he was happy of course (nimirum) to have
seen so many years come round.

252. nimio de stamina] Of the long
thread of his life. See note on S. iii. 27.
He wept sore for his son Antilochus, who
was killed by Memnon. Propertius (iii. 4.
47, Paley) says of him:

“ Cui si longaevae minuisset fata senectae
[Gallicus] Iliacis miles in aggeribus,
Non ille Antilochi vidisset corpus humati,
Diceret aut, O mors! cur mihi sera
venis ?”

¹ Barbam ' implies that he was of mature
age. ‘Ardentem ’ means his body burning
on the pile. The construction, ‘ quaerit ab
omni, quisquis adest socius,’ where ‘ socio ’
may be supplied aster ‘ omni,’ is the same
as in v. 210.
