Sic possem affari : Die, o vanissime, quis te
Festinare jubet? meliorem praesto magistro

Diseipulum.

Securus abi, vinceris, ut- Ajax

Praeteriit Telamonem, ut Pelea vicit Achilles.
Parcendum est teneris; nondum implevere medullas 215

Maturae mala nequitiae.

Quum pectere barbam

Coeperit et longi mueronem admittere cultri,
Falsus erit testis, vendet perjuria summa
Exigua, Cereris tangens aramque pedemque.

Elatum jam crede nurum, si limina vestra
Quibus illa premetur

Mortifera cum dote subit.

Per somnum digitis ! nam quae terraque marique
Acquirenda putas brevior via conferet illi.

Nullus enim mag-ni sceleris labor.

210. quemcunque] See above, v. 42, n.

212. meliorem praesto magistro] ‘ Prae-
εἴθ’ is ‘ Ι warrant,’ and ‘ fore ’ may be sup-
plied aster ‘ meliorem.' He says to the
father he need not be in a hurry ; he may
go away aud make himself easy; bis son is
certain to turn out a good scholar aud sur-

adds sarcastically, “ you must not press
the young mind ; his marrow is not yet
thoroughly saturated with the atrocities of
matured vice; when he eomes to man's
estate he will be ripe for all that is wicked.''
The expression ⁸ nondum implevere medul-
las' is something like that in the book of
Job (xx. 13): “His bones are full of the
sin of his youth.”

216. Quum pectere barbam] See vi. 215,
n. Before ‘ quum ’ Jahn, Hermann, [and
Ribbeck} after one MS. and two of the
old editors, have introduced ‘ast.’ P. has
‘nequitia est? The particle is not wanted
and is extremely awkward. As to ⁶ tangens
aram’ see S. iii. 145, n. ς xiii. 89.

220. Elatum jaon crede nurum] “You

may consider your daughter-in-law as good
as dead and buried if she brings your son
a large portion.” Her ‘ dos' would be to
her what another gift is said to be to
others: “ Torrens dicendi copia multis Et
sua mortifera est facundia '’ (x. 10). Ex-
cept under special agreement before mar-
riage the wife’s ‘dos' went back to her
relations at her death. Here the man
must secure an interest in the property at
his wife’s death, or it would bc against his
interest to murder her. The way in which
a woman was carried over the threshold of
her new home on the day of her marriage
is related in Dict. Ant„ ‘Roman Marriage.’
‘ Quibus digitis 1' is expressive—‘with what
fingere !' We can almost see the man
clutcbing his wife's throat. Ruperti's pro-
posal to put a (Ρ) after ‘ digitis’ (ut sensus
sit, Quibusnam aliis quam mariti sui qui
tuus est filius Ρ) destroys the meaning
altogether.

225. Mandavi‚] ‘ Man-dare ' is used here
like ‘ tra-dere' for teaching (see above, v.
3, n.).

228. pueros producit avaros,] ‘ Produ-
cere’ is here to educate, as in S. vi. 241 :
“ utile porro Filiolam turpi vetulae produ-
cere turpem,” where the construction is
the same. The next line is omitted in
some MSS„ but not in the best. It has no
grammatical connexion with the sentence;
