Ecce avia, aut metuens divum matertera, cunis
Exemit puerum, frontemque atque uda labella

Insaini digito et lustralibus ante salivis

Expiat, urentes oeulos inhibere perita.

Tune manibus quatit, et spem macram supplice voto :35
Nunc Licini in campos, nunc Crassi mittit in aedes.

‘ Hunc optent generum rex et regina ς puellae

Hunc rapiant ; quiequid calcaverit hic rosa fiat !’

Ast ego nutrici non mando vota ; negato,

Jupiter, haec illi, quamvis te albata rogarit.

33. Insami diyito] This is the middle
finger usually called ‘ famosus? See note
on Hor. S. ii. 8. 26, “indice monstraret
digito.” The grandmother or aunt, which-
ever it may be, wets the baby's brow and
lips with spittle on her middle finger, as if
it was holy water, to keep away the Evil
Eye. Casaubon has a long note on the
lustration of infants which may be read
with interest, but it does not conc-ern this
place. The power of certain malignam,

the cai-liest times, and is finnly credited
still by many of our own peasantry. Shep-
herds feared the Evil Eye for their flocks,
as they do now. See Virgil, Ecl. iii. 103,
“Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat
agnos.’' See also Plutarch, Quaes. Symp.

word which may or may not be used with
contempt.

35. Tune manibus quatit,] She tosses
him in her arms and prays that her slender
hopeful may one day possess the lands of
Licinus, the wealthy freedman of C. Julius
Caesar (Juv. i. 109), or be master of the
palace of Crassus, that. is M. Crassus who
was killed by the Parthians, and whose
wealth was enormouS‚ as related by Plu-
tarch in his life. These two names are
used proverbially here. As to ‘rapiant ’

see note on Juv. S. vi. 404, “quis diri-
piatur adulter.’' ‘ Non mando,’ ‘ I don't
entrust a nurse with making prayers,·' it
is not her business. ‘Alhata’ is with a
clean dress on, as she would have on a very
solemn occasion. See note on Hor. S. ii.
2. 61, “ Festos albatus celebret.''

42. {avetaque crassa] that sort of
dish ‘ tucetum ' was is not very clear.
According to the Scholiast here, it was
bees dressed up in some shape. It was
something coarse. Persius says the man
prays for health, but his gluttonous coarse
feeding will not allow of his prayer being
granted. ‘Esto age' is ‘well‚ be it soJ'
that is, ‘your prayer is all right, but how
is it to be granted P’

45. da fortunare Penates,] ‘ Grani: me
to enrich my household gods.’ The poet is
speaking of those fools who while they
prayed to the gods to enlarge their herds
and flocks, wasted them in sacrifices offered
to obtain their increase. ‘Qu0, pessime,
paeto ³ is copied from Horace, S. ii. 7. 22,
“ ‘Ad te, inquam? ‘Quo paeto, pessime ρ’ ”
‘Junix' is not a common word. lt is a cow
not quite full grown, but bigger than a calt',
‘vitula.’ As to ‘omenta ' seeJuv. S. xiii. 118.
‘ Fertum ' is a sort of cake used in sacrifice.
The man's sanguine eagerness is well ex-
pressed in the words that are given him,
and these hopes continue till the last bit of
money is left to sigh forlorn at. the bottom
of the ehest. The man's disappointment
