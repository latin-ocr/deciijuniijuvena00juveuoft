D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Exstantem, et medio sublimem in pulvere Circi
In tunica Jovis‚ et pictae Sarrana ferentem
Ex humeris aulaea tog-ae, magnaeque coronae

Tantum orbem quanto cervix non suffieit ulla?

40

Quippe tenet sudans 113110 publicus et, sibi Consul
Ne placeat, curru servus porta-tur codem.
Da nune et volucrem sceptro quae surgit eburno,
Illinc cornicines, hine praecedentia longi

Agminis officia, et niveos ad fraena Quirites

45

Defossa in loculis quos sportula fecit amicos.
Tum quoque materiam risus invenit ad omnes
Occursus hominum, cujus prudentia· monstrat
Summos posse viros et magna exempla daturos

Vervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci.

50

Ridebat curas 1100 11011 et gaudia vulgi,

Interdum et lacrimas, quum Fortunae ipse minaci

Blanda-ret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.
Ergo supervacua. aut perniciosa petuntur,

Propter quae fas est genua incerare deorum.

ing (see note on Hor. S. ii. 2. 60: “Ille
repotia, natales aliosve dierum Festos
albatus celeb1·et’'). ‘ Longi agminis officia’
is equivalent to ‘longum agmen officioso-
rum ;' ‘ servitium,' ‘conjugium‚' ‘remi-
gium,’ and other words 310 used in the
same way. ‘ Officio fungi ³ was a common
expression for attendance upon great peo-
ple. Horace has ‘ officium facio ³ (Epp. i.
17. 21) and ‘officiosa sedulitas' (Epp. i. 7.
8) 111 the same sense. The men who waited
on the praetor were his friends in virt-ne of
the dole they carried off every day (S. i.
95, n.). He says they buried it in their
bag, on which Grangaeus has a note,
adopted by Ruperti, that it was buried in
the patron's purse as if in the earth ς
“facete et satirice iu avaros.''

47. Tum quoque materiam] “Evcn at
that time he found material for laughter
wherever he met with men, he whose wis-
dom shows‚” &c. The people of Abdera
were proverbial for dulness, like the Boeo-
tians. “Boeotum in crasso jurares aere na-
tum '⁵ (Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 244, where 500 note).
It appears that the stupidity of a people
was commonly charged upon the dulness of
their climate, which may make a difference,
but has not generally much to do with the
matter. “Abderitanae pectora plebis habes''
is equivalent to saying “you are a fool'’
(Martial x. 25). ‘ Vervex,’ a wether, was

55

as commonly as a hog taken for the type
of stupidity.

52. Fortunae ipse minaci] “He could
laugh at the troubles of others, for even if
For-tune threatened himself he could bid
her go and be hang-ed, and point the finger
of scorn at her.” The middle finger was
so used, and was commonly called ‘famo-
sus ' in consequence, as the first was called
‘ index’ and the third ‘medicus.' See
notes on Hor. S. ii. 8. 26, 311(1 Persius
ii. 33.

54. Ειῃο supervacua aut] This is the
reading of the MSS. with one exception,
which has ‘ vel? The editors have mended
the verse in different ways ς but it must be
taken 35 311 instance of caesural hiatus, of
which there 310 many in Juvenal. [Rib-
beck has ‘ aut ne perniciosa petantur? with
a note of interrogation after ‘deoruni‚'
which does not iinprove the passage]
‘ Ergo ' 15, ‘ as Ι was saying‚ then,' or ‘to
proceed, ‘them’ and he lays it down as a
matter of experience that what men ask of
the gods is generally useless or mischievous.
He has given some instances, and he goes
on to dwell on the vanity of power, as
shown by the fate of those who have had it.

55. Propter quaefas est] Heinrich says
this is a comic expression ς they do it, and
so they may if they please, nobody will
prevent them. Ruperti wishes to substi-
