SATIRA IX.

Yivendum recte est cum propter plurima tum his
Praecipue causis, ut linguas mancipiorum

Contcmuas: nam lingua mali pars pessima servi.

. Deterior tamen hic qui liber non erit illis
Quorum animas ct farre suo custodit ct aere.
Idcirco ut possim linguam contemnere servi,
Utile consilium modo sed commune dedisti :
Nunc mihi quid suades post damnum temporis et spes 125
, Deceptus? Festinat enim decurrere velox
Flosculus angustae miseraeque brevissima vitae
Portio ε dum bibimus, dum serta, unguenta, puellas
Poscimus‚ obrepit non intellecta senectus

Ne trepida ε nunquam pathicus tibi deerit amicus

Stantibus et salvis his collibus; undique ad illos
Convenient et carpentis et navibus omnes

Qui digito scalpunt uno caput.

Domo, c. 29, Loug’s note. This use of
‘ facere ' with or without ‘ sacra’ or ‘ rein
divinam ' is not uncommon. See Cic. pro
Murena (sub fin.): ‘¹ J unonis Sospitae, cui
omnes eonsules facere necesse est.”

118. tum his] There is some variation
in the readings herc, as might be expected.
⁸ Tum his ' is that of the best MSS. except
P„ which has ‘tunc est,’ and Jahn [and
Ribbeck] adopt that reading. 111 S. v.
10 there is ‘possis cum honestius? where
the syllable is not cut off, but is short (see
note). Here it is long, and Heinrich quotes
Tibullus (i. 5. 33) : “ Et tantum venerata
virum hunc sedula curet. '²

121. Deterior tamen hic] He says,
though gossiping slaves are very bad, he
is worse who' ιε the slave of thosey whom he
maintains. As to the slave' s allowance see
note on‘ epimenia' in S. vii. 120.

123. Idcirco ut possim] Here Naevolus
replies, though it is probable this verse is
spurious, as Heinrich and Pithoeus before
him judg ed it tobe. P. has it after v . 118,
with ‘ possis ' [and Jahn puts it in the same
place with the reading ‘ possis? Ribbeck
places vv. 118, 119, and also 120—124 at
the bottom of his page under the text, with
the variatione ‘tunc est,' ‘cave sis' for
‘ causis, ' and ‘ nec ' for ‘ nam. ’ Jahn thinks
that vv. 120,121 are spurious] Naevolus
tells his counsellor that his advice is good,
but too generah now he wants to know
what he had better do to redeem his lost
time and make up for his disappointmeuts,

Altera major

since the prime of life is passing and age
is insensibly crceping on while he is wast-
ing his time. He expresses himself in very
poetical verseS, which Juvenal could write
when he pleascd, as most men cau who
have a vig-orons hold of their own language
and of truth.

131. Slantibus et salvis his collibu.s·;]
This is equivalent to “Incolumi Jove et
urbe Roma ’' (Hor. C. iii. 5. 12). ‘Car-
pentis et navibus ' is another way of saying
by sea and land, like “ Navibus atquc Quad-
rigis petimus bene vivere’' (Hor. Epp. i.
11. 28). “ Qui digito scalpunt uno caput ”
was a proverb for persons of effeminate
habits. Plutarch says that Clodius, attack-
ing Pompeius in an assembly of the people,
asked the crowd such questions as these:
τίς ἐστιν αὐτοκράτωρ ἆκόλαστοςς τίς ἀνὴρ
ἄνδρα ζητεῖ; τίς ἑνὶ δακτύλῳ κνᾶται τὴν
κεφαλήν; (vit. Pomp. c. 48, fin.) See
Long's note on Cic. pro P. Sestio, c. 55:

“Cantorum convicio.'’ In Seneca (Con-
trov. iii. 19) a distich of Calvus’ on Poni-
peius is preserved :

“ Fasciola qui crura ligat, digito caput uno
Βοίὲῑῖξιῐᾈξξιιὶᾱ credas huuc sibi velle vi-

tells him gravely there is hope ofhis having
a still better business, and he has only to go
on eating stimulants till it falls in. ‘Eruca’
is the rocket, a vegetable eatcn as a provo-
cative of appetite and lust. Sec Hor. S. 1i.
