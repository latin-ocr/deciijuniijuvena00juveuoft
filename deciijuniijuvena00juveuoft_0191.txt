Cum domina: sed tu jam durum, Postume, jamque
Tondendum eunucho Bromium committere noli.
Si gaudet cautu nullius fibula durat

Vocem vendentis Praetoribus5 organa semper

In manibus3 densi radiant testudine tota

Sardonyches ;

crispo numerantur pectine chordae,

Quo tener Hedymeles operam dedit : hunc tenet, hoc se
Solatur gratoque indulget basia plectro.

Quaedam de numero Lamiarum ac nominis alti

Cum farre et vino Janum Vestamque rogabat,
An Capitoliumn deberet Pollio quercum

S. viii. 194, n. He turns to the woman
whose taste lies in music and musicians,
and says none of these ean withstand her
ads-ances. She always carries about the
harp of ber favourite, whom he calls Hedy-
meles (ἡδὺ μέλος), and plays upon it aud
kisses it in the absence of its owner. He
describes it as set all round with stones.
Cicero describes a ‘ citharoedus' as coming
before the audience “optime vestitus, palla
inaurata indutus cum chlamyde purpurea
coloribus variis intexta, et cum corona
aurea magnis fulgentibus gemmis illumi-
nata, citharam tenens exornatis-simam, auro
et ebore distinctam, ipse praeterea forma
et specie et statura apposita ad dignitatem”
(ad Herenn. iv. 47). 'l'he ‘ sardonyx,' the
stone most frequently used for gemS, Pliny
(xxxvii. 6) says was first brought into
fashion by the elder Scipio, aud from that
time became very highly esteemed. The
bottom of the lyre, the original conception
of which was supposed to have been de-
rived from the shell of the tortoise, con-
tinued to late times to be made of that
material. (See Dict. Ant„ ‘Lyra.’) As
to the different sorts of musical iustru-
ments that went by the general name of
‘organa,' see Forcellini. ‘Pecten' and
‘plectrum’ were both used to signify a
small staff with which the strings were
commonly struck, though it seems the
fingers were used sometimes without it.
See Virg. Aen. vi. 647 = “ Jamque eadem
digitis, jam pectine pulsat eburn0.'' And
Persius, vi. 2: “Jamne lyra et tetrico
vivunt tibi pectine chordae ?'’ The latter
is the Greek name for the same thing
(from πλήσσειν), the other is taken from a
comparison of this instrument with the
comb which weavers use. See Dict. Ant„
‘ Tela? ‘ Crisp0,’ Forcellini says, is ‘celeri
et crispante‚' ‘ quick and darting.'

‘ Numerantur' is the reading of all the
MSS. Jahn gives ‘pulsanti' as thc read-
ing of the Scholiast. “Gt-ispo.- eburno scili-
cet pectine qui crispet et agitet cordas-5 aut
scutulato ct pulcro.'’ It is supposed his word
‘agitet’ refers to ‘pulsantur' or ‘vibrantur’
in the text. (Markland ad Stat. silv. iii. 5.
64.) Jahn edits ‘pulsantur.' But ‘numeran-
tur’ is not likely to have been invented. It
means that numbers are brought from the
chords hythe striking of the ‘ pecten.' [In
v. 383 Jahn and Ribbeck have ‘operas’
from P. and other MSS]

385. Quaedam de numero Lamiarum]
He says some noble lady once upon a time
offered sacrifice to J anus and Vesta to
Iearn whether her favourite musician would
win the crowu at the games. As to the
Lamiae, see note on iv. 154. As to the
‘salted cake' (far, mola salsa), see note
on Hor. C. iii. 23. 20: “ Farre pio et
saliente mica.’' Janus was worshipped
first of all the gods (as explained more
fully on Hor. S. ii. 6. 20, “ Matutine pater
seu Jane libentius audis''), and Vesta last,
which Cicero explains thus: “ Vis ejus ad
aras et focos pertinet. Itaque in ea Dea.
quae est rerum custos intimarum, omnis et
precatio et sacrificatio extrema. est.'’ (De
Nat. Deor. ii. 27.) Juvenal therefore
makes his woman pray to all. the gods at
once, from Janus to Vesta.

For ‘nominis alti' the Scholiast had
‘ nominis Appi‚' and hc adds ¹ Appiam sig-
nificat? But, as Cramer says, ‘ac' must
in that case be ‘ aut,’ and then the verse is
weakened. Jahn has ‘ Appi,’ and Ruperti
appi-oves.

387. An Capitolinam] Suetonius says
of Domitian (vit. Domit. c. 4), “Instituit
quinquennale certamen Capitolino Jovi
triplex, musicum, equestre, gymnicum et
aliquanto plurium quam nune est corona-
torum. Certabant etiam et prosa oratione
