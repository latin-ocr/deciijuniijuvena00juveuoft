Optandam, si Laurenti custodit in agro
Conductas Corvinus oves ’Β ego possideo plus
Pallante et Licinis.” Exspectent ergo Tribuni ;

times magistrates (who were now sunk very
low) were among the crowds who waitcd on
the rich. The master says, “ Give the
Praetor first, after him the Tribunus ;’'
but a freedinan who bad come before either
of them, asserts his claim to be seri-cd be-
fore them ; and a long speech is put into
his mouth, in which he makes himself out
to be richer than the men of office, and
therefore entitled to take precedence of
them, an odd argument at such atiine. As
to ‘libertinns,' see Hor. S. i. 6. 6, 11. ‘ Sed
libertinus prior est ’ is part of the narrative,
not the words of the ‘ Dispensator‚' 1151111-
perti says.

104. Natus ad Euphratem] He may
mean from Cappadocia, from which part
the Romans got a good many of their slaves

(vii. 15). See Martial x. 76 :

“Civis non Syriaeve Parthiaeve
Nec de Cappadocis eques eatastis.’'

‘ Penestrae' are the holes made for earrings,
and they are called ‘ molles,' which means
effeminate. The man says he has five
houses, which he lets out for shops, and
they are worth 4ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sesterces which
was an equestrian fortune; unless with
Heinrich we understand ‘ quinque tabernae'
to be those spoken of by Livy as bankiug
houses 111 the forum: ‘¹ Septem tabernae
quae postea quinque et argentariae quae
nunc Novae appellantur '’ (xxvi. 27). In
that case the man means his transactions at
the ‘ quinque tabernae' bring him in this
income. 1 incline to this interpretation.
With ‘ qnadringenta' ‘ sestertia' must be
supplied. See iii.153, sq.; v. 132; xiv.
323 ; and Hor. Epod. iv. 15, n.

106. purpura major] That is, (as the
Seholiast says) the ‘latus clavus‚’ or broad
purple stripe on the tunic worn by senators,
as opposed to the ‘ angustus clavus’ worn
by ‘equites' (See Dict. Ant.; and Hor. S. i.
5. 36, n.; ii. 7. 10, n.) A ‘ tribunus mili-
tum' of the first four legions was entitled
to a seat in the senate, and therefore to
the ‘latus clavus ;' but it was allowed to
others who were not senators under the
einpire.

107. si Laurenti custodit in ayro]
Laurentum, supposed to be at the site of

Torre di Paterno, is near the coast, and
about eight miles from Ostia. It was a
winter resort of the Romans, and abouuded
with villas. Large flocks ot' sheep were fed
there, and the marshes in 1118 neighbour-
hood were famous for wild boars, which
Horace, however, does not recommend (S.
ii. 4. -1-2). Corvinus was a cognomen oftbe
Messalae, who were a 111-1111811 ofthe Valeria
Gens, one of the oldest familics in Rome.
(Hor. C. iii. 21, Int.; S. i. 6. 12, 11., “con-
tra Laevinum, Valeri genus.'’) This gen-
tleman of old family is supposed to be re-
duced 10 keeping sheep as a ‘ mercenarius.’
A person is said ‘conducere rem faciendam‚’
in which case 118 receives pay (‘ merces’)
or ‘ conducere rem utendam,’ in which case
he pays another for the thing used. (See
note on Hor. C. ii. 18. 17, and Long on
Cic. in Verr. Act. i. c. 6, there quoted.)

108. ‘'JJO possideo plus] That ‘ possidere’
was used generally in the sense of possessing
property, and not confined to the ‘ posses-
sores' teclmically so called, is obvious from
this and many passages. The ‘ possessorcs'
of the republican period were occupiers
of public lands ; and this man could not be
a ‘ possessor’ in that sense any more thau
Pallas or Licinus, He makes himself out
to be vastly rich, and yet 118 15 here
begging.

109. Pallante et Licinis] The man's
speech ends here. Pallas was a freedman
of Claudius, in whose reign he got together
a large fortune, for the sake of which he
was put to death by Nero, Λα). 63. Licinus
was a Gaulish slave manumitted by C.
Julius Caesar, andmadeby Augustus gover-
nor of Gallia, which he robbed, and thereby
grew very rich. The Sclioliast says it was
to stop pcople's mouths that he built a
‘ basilica' 111 the name of C. Julius Caesar
(the Basilica J ulia in the Forum Romanum).
He died in the reign of Tiberius This,
the Scholiast says, is the Licinus mentioned
by Persius (S. ii. 36). This may very
likely be the person alluded to by Juvenal
here and at xiv. 306. The authorities for
his life are quoted in Dict. Biog. ’1118
counnentators refer to members of 1118
¹ Licinia gens‚' of which the family of
Crassus in particular was very rich. As to
