Sanguine censeri pictosque ostendere vultus

Majorum, et stantes in curribus Aemilianos,

Et Curios jam dimidios, humeroque minorem

Corvinum, et Galbam auriculis nasoque carentem? 5
Quis fructus generis tabula jactare capaci

Corvinum, posthac multa contingere virga.

there were portmits with wreaths twined
about them: “Stemmata vero lineis ‹lis-
currcbant ad imagines pictas.'' On these
were inscribed the names and officos of the
persons represented. Seneca (dc Benef.
iii. 28) speaks of those “qui imagines in
atrio exponunt et nomina familiae suae
longo ordine ac multis stemmatum illi-
gata flexuris in parte prima aedium collo-
cant:’' and he further says these persons
are “noti magis quam nobiles‚'’ more
known than worth knowing. The table
itself oeme to be called ‘stemma' from
these wrcaths. Suetonius says of Galba
(vit. Galb. c. 2) that hc was “ haud dubie
nobilissimus ut qui statuarum titulis Pro-
nepotem se Q. Catuli Capitolini semper
adscripserit ; imperator vero etiam stemma
in atrio proposuerit quo paternam originem
ad Jovem, maternam ad Pasiphaen Minois
uxorem referret.'' In Nero’s reign Sue-
tonius says (vit. Ner. c. 37) Cassius Longi-
nus was put to death ‘⁶ quod in vetere
gentili stemmate C. Cassii, percussoris
Caesaris, imagines retinuisset’' (see x. 16,
11.). Martial says (iv. 40), “Atria Piso-
num stabant cum stemmate tot0” for their
whole pedigree. See note on Persius, iii.
28: “Stemmate quod Tusco ramum mille-
sime ducis? ‘ Pictos vultus' are the
portraits on these genealogical trees, and
correspond to the ‘imagines pictas’ of
Pliny (1. c.) which are not to be confused
with the ‘imagines cereae’ he also men-
tions.

2. Sanguine censeri] This construction
of ‘ censere ' with the ablative is not found
in the writers before the empire. Itis the
ablative of value, and ‘longo sanguine cen-
seri ' is to be valued at the worth of a long
line of ancestors. Some MSS. have ‘pictos'
without the conjunction. Jahn has it so
[and Ribbeck]

3. stanles in curribus] See S.vii. 125, n.;
x. 59. The only historieal Aemilianus
when this was written was the younger
Scipio, who was born of the Aemilia gens,
an old patrician family (S. vii. 124). His
father was L. Aemilius Paulus Macedoni·
cus, but he was adopted by P. Cornelius
Scipio, the sou of the elder Scipio

Africanus. The full name of the younger
after his adoption was l'. Cornelius Scipio
Aemilianus to which Africanus was after-
wards added as an agnomen. The Curii
were a plebeian sannily‚ of whom M.
Curius Dentatus was the first distinguished
member (see S. ii. 3, n.). Corvinus was a
cognomen of the Valeria gens, a very old
family (Hor. S. i. 6. 12, n.)‚ among whom
Horace's friend and patron, Messalla Cor-
vinus, was the most illustrious (C. iii. 21).
The Galbae belonged to the Sulpicia gens,
which was patrician and of great antiquity
(sce note on v. 1). ‘ Jam dimidios ’ means
that they are broken in half, as ‘vultus
dimidios ³ (xv. 56). Most MSS. have ‘na-
sumque minorem Corvini? P. and a Nfirn-
berg MS. have ‘ umeros? A Dresden
MS. has ‘ huine1·o,' which I think is right.
The bust, which is of wax, is supposed to
have lost an arm or to have a piece ont of
the shoulder. The editors have ‘hunum-os?
[Ribbeck places vv. 4—8 at the bottom of
his page as a clumsy interpolation.]

6. ,qeneris tabula] A great roll of his
ancestors that the man is supposed to
keep. The next line appears iu P. and
many Paris MSS. of Achaintre. It is
noticcd by the Scholiast, and is contained
in one Niirnberg MS. and two quoted by
Lipsius, who first introduced it, with so
much confidence “ut scelus sit dubitare
de germanitate3 neque enim de trivio
versus est et ad rem nimis aptus ” (Epist.
Quaest. iv. 15). The Scholiast and he
take ‘ virga ' for the ‘ fasces: and so does
Foreellini. The commentators now are
generally agreed in rejecting· thc verse.
Heinrich, who does so, supposes by ‘ virga’
the interpolator meant a broom to keep
the busts elcan, as in Ovid, Fast. iv. 736:
“ Unda prius spargat virgaque verrat
humum.’' ‘Contingere’ may have a little
more meaning with this interpretation of
‘virga,' but that word is very doubtful.
Jahn (V. L.) mentions a reading ‘dedu-
cere‚' but in this ease ‘ deducerc’ does not
appear to give any sense. ‘ Post hunc'
waS, I think, the original reading, whether
the verse bc genuine or not, and I do not
think it is; not, however, “because the
