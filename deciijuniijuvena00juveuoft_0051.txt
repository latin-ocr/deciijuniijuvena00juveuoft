SATIRA I.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS satire, for reasons stated in v. 47, could not have been written before ΑΛ). 100
and was probably not written long after that date. Heinrich, whose judgment I have
a great respect for, says it is not so much a satire as a pref-ace or introduction to a volume
of satires. It is certainly a satire as severe as any in the book. Juvenal had probably
written others before it, but 1 do not see enough in this poem to entitle it to be called a
preface. He says all the passions ofmen from the flood downwards are the hodge-podge
of his book-“ nostri farrago libelli ’' (v. 86)—and he has touched upon a good many of
them in this satire. which may be the ‘libellus ' he means. lf not, he must have been
intending to publish a collection ; for ‘ libellus ' must mean something definite, either one
poem or a collection. He begins with supposing himself persuaded by some person not
to write, as Horace pretends with Trebatius (S.ii. 1). But the times are such, he says,
that he cannot help it; and while there are so many indifferent poets sponting their lines
every where, he may as well write as others. He then goes into a detail of some of the
vile features of society ; among which are the voluntary degradation of women 3 their
lewdness ς the preferment of slaves and informers3 the impunity of robbers, and forgers,
and murderers; men selling the honour of their wives ς women poisoning their hnsbands 3
incest and adultery undisguised; avarice, gamhling, extravagance, gluttony 3 the con-
tempt and neglect of the poor by the rich ς magistrates degraded into beggars. The burst
about the poets and their recitations is only a way of introducing humorously the graver
matters that follow. A good deal of what was recited was no doubt bad enough ς but .
J uvenal's quarrel was not with his literary brethren, whose cause he takes up, as well
as their recitationS, in the seventh satire. They have in reality nothing to do with the
satire as such, though Juvenal pretends they have. The arguments prefixed to the MSS.
trent this satire as a preface to the rest. Ruperti, on the. other hand, thinks it was
written before all the others, and Dryden that it is “the natural groundwork of all the
rest ;'' for “ herein he confines himself to no one sulfiect, but strikes indifferently at
all men in his way ς in every following satire he has chosen some particular moral which
he would inculcate, and lashes some particular vice or folly.’' I sce no proofs one way or
the other. 11: might have been written first or last for any evidence I can find in the poem
itself, irrespective of the sign of the date noticcd above, which puts it later perhaps than
some.
