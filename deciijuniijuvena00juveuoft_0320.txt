D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Templorum quoque majestas praesentior ct vox
Nocte fere media mediamque audita per Urbem,
Litore ab Oceano Gallis venientibus et dis

Officium vatis peragentibus.

Hanc rebus Latiis curam praestare solebat

His monuit nos,

Fictilis et nullo violatus J uppiter auro.
Illa domi natas nostraque ex arbore mensas
Tempora viderunt : hos lignum stabat in usus,

111. Templorum quoque majestas] He
says that in the old times the gods were
nearer to men, they helped them more di-
rectly, and he refers to the story told by
Livy (v. 32) of one having heard a voice
louder than that of man in the dead of
night, ordering him to report to the magis-
trates that the Gauls were coming. Cicero
tells the same story 111 nearly the same way,
de Divin. i. 45, and again ii. 32. An altar
was raised on the spot where the voice was
heard to the unknown god who uttered it,
and who was called Aius Locutius from ‘aio’
and ‘ loquor? [Ribbeck has placed vv.
111—119 after v. 107.]

113. Litore ab Oceano] The MSS. vary
here, as in v. 94, between Oceani and Ocea-
no. Ribbeck has ‘ Oceano ' in both places 3
Jahn has ‘Oceano ⁹ in v. 9-1. and ‘ Oceani '
here. Lipsius (Epp. Quaest. iv. 25) sup-
ports the amative, and there can be no
doubt that it is supported by usage. See
Forcellini for examples. Livy, with refer-
ence to the Gaulish invasion, speaks of
“ inusitato atque inaudito hoste ab Oceano
terrarumque ultimis oris bellum ciente '³ (V.
37). Cicero (de Div. i. 10) says, “Quum
Summanus in fastigio Jovis Optimi Maximi
qui tum erat fictilis e caelo ictus esset‚'' Sco.
Valerius Maximus (“ de Paupertate lau-
data,'’ iv. 4. 11) says with reference to the
Fabricii, Curii, and the rest, “ per Romuli
casam, perque veteres Capitolii humilia
tecta et aeternos Vestae focos fictilibus
etiamnum vasis contentos juro, nullas divi-
tias talium virorum paupertati posse prae-
ferri.'' ‘ Dii fictiles' are commonly re-
ferred to. ‘ Violatus ' is ‘ wronged,' as if
it was an insult to gild him. Juvenal says
111 S. iii. 20, “ nec ingenuum violarent
marmora tophum.''

114. His monuit noan] I prefer the punc-
tuation of the text to Heinrich’s, which joins
these words on with the preceding. But
Heinrich says ‘ his ³ (the reading of all the
MSS.) cannot be right. I think it 15. It
means, as Madvig explains (Opp. ii. p.
170), “hujusmodi signis.” Heinrich sug-
gests ‘ hinc.'

118. hos lignum stabat] J ahn’s reading
‘hoe' from P. and another is very bad.
Hermann does well to condemn it. [Jahn
and Ribbeck have also ‘ad’ for ‘in.']
‘Stabat' is like ‘exstabatf There was
wood for these purposes. He goes onto
spe-ak of the tables of the rich which used
to 110 made of any common home-grown
trec, as an old walnut blown down hy the
wind3 but now they cannot eat their din-
ner unless they have handsome round
tables with ivory stems. See S. i. 137,
n. :

“N am de tot pulcris et latis orbibus et
Aniiiiiiis una comedunt patrimonia men-
sa.”

These round tables bada single stem which
was carved in a variety of ways. It was
commonly ornam ented with ivory, and more
commonly with silver. Lucian calls them
τράπεζαι ἐλαφαντόποδες. Martial says to
his friend Candidus (ii. 43) :

“ Tu Libycos Indis suspendis dentibus
orbes, ⁷
Fulcitur testa fagina mensa mihi.”

Juvenal had one in his eye which was sup-
ported by a leopard rampant, not a very
natural position. Scented oils of various
kinds, of which the nardum was most
costly‚ were used by the Romans plentifully.
At their evening parties after dinner, when
they met to drink and play, ‘unguenta'
were commonly served out to the guests,
and chaplets of fiowers supplied by the
host were put upon their heads : they were
usually roses sewu on to a band of linden
bark, ‘ philyra? (“ Displicent nexae phily- »
ra coronae‚'' Hor. C. i. 38. See Juv. S.
v. 36.) Roses were scattered on the floor
at the regular dinner (see Becker’s Gallus,
Exc. 011 the Grarlands). As to the ‘ rhom-
bus' see iv. 39. ‘ Dama' is an antelope,
which when young was and is a great
delicacy.
