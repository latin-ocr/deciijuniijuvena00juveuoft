sometimes called, like some others, was a
late importation into Rome. Her image,
which according to Livy (xxix. 11) was a
stone, was brought from Pessinus in Gra-
latia during the second Punic VVar, and she
had a temple built her on Mons Palatinus,
and consecrated by M. J unius Brutus,
A.U.C. 563. (See below, iii. 137, 11.) Τ110
festival called Megalesia (from μεγάλη θεά)
was established in her honour. It began
on the 4th of April, and lasted six days.
Cybele was called Idaea Mater, Berecyntia,
Dindymene, from hills of Phrygia where she
was principally worshipped with impure
rites and much discordant noise, her priests
being called Corybantes In Rome they
were called Galli, from the place they came
(Hor. S. i.
It does not appear from Ovid's
description (Fasti, iv. 179-384) that the
same impurities were practised at Rome as
in the East. They were regulated by the
Ciu-ule Aediles, and they are called by
Cicero (de Harusp. Resp. 12) “maxime
casti solemnes 1·eligiosi.'' (See ad Fam. ii.
11.) As to ‘fracta voce‚' Foreellini quotes
Pliny, Epp. ii. 14, “ fracta pronuntiatione
dicere,'' which 110 explains, “ effeminata,
enervi 3 0111 opponitur intenta, incitata, for-
tis.'' Quintilian (xii. 10) says Cicero's eon-
temporaries ventured to attaek him as “in
compositione fractum ae paene viro mollio-
1·em.'’ In this sense the reading ‘frangitur
artubus' for ‘ fingitur artibus‚’ in Hor. C.
iii. 6. 22, is supported. (See note.)

112. et crine senex fanaticus albo] He
says the chief priest of these orgies was an
old man with white hair, an extraordinary
glutton, and one who might be hired to
teach the science of eating. ‘Fanaticus’ is
derived from ‘fanum ;' and was applied
commonly to the priests of Bellona, but
also to those of any frantie ritual. From
the particularity with which he writes, it
appears as if Juvenal was describing some-
thing that had taken place.

115. Quid tamen exspectant] He means
why do they not proceed at once to make

from, and they were eunuehs.

themselves what the Gralli were (see note
on v. 111), for they ought to have done so
long ago, being “ Phrygians long since in
heart” (Gifford). ‘ Tempus erat' seems
to be used in cases where further delay is
deprecated, as if the time had come and

was being allowed to pass away.

“—— nune Saliaribus

See Hor.

See also S. iii. 163, 11. below. Here this
abominable scene is brought to an end.

117. Quadrinffenta dedit] He now goes
on to tell how some rich person entered
into a moek marriage with a musieian, and
gave him a ‘dos’ equal to the fortune of
an eques, and how at the marriage-supper
110 lay 011 1115 11050111 as his bride in the pre-
sence of a large company. Tacitus describes
how Nero went through a solemn farce of
this kind, in which he acted as bride as this
Gracchus did: “Uni ex illo contaminato-
rum grege (Comp. Contaminato eum grege
turpium Morbo virorum, Hor. C. i. 37 . 9)
cui nomen Pythagorae fuit in modum sol-
lennium conjugiorum denupsisset. luditum
Imperatori flammeum (a veil worn by
brides), visi auspices, dos et genialis torus
et faces nuptiales 3 cuncta denique spec-
tata quae etiam in femina nox ope1·it.'’
(Arm. xv. 37.) How 110 married the boy
Sporus has been mentioned above on i. 62.
As to ‘quadringenta sestertia,’ see i. 106,
11., and vi. 134, and Hor. C. iii. 24. 18, n.
‘ Dos' was the portion brought by the wife
to the husband. Gracchus therefore acted
the bride. ‘ Recto aere' means the ‘tuba‚’
which was straight, while the ‘ cornu' was
curved. (See note on Hor. C. i. 1. 23; and
Ovid, Met. i. 98.) Juvenal says the man
played 011 the ‘cornu' or ‘tuba‚’ he does
not know which. It seems as if his story
was founded on fact. ‘eantare’ is used
not only for the'human voice, but for in-
strumental music.
