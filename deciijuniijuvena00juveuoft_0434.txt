A. PERSII FLACCI

Claudere sic versum didicit Berecyntius Attis,
Et qui caeruleum dirimebat Nerea delphin 3

Sic costam longo subduximus Apennino.

Arma virum, nonne hoc spumosum et cortice pingui,
Ut ramale vetus praegrandi subere coctum Ρ)
Quidnam igitur tenerum et laxa cervice legendum ⁴?

the day, and is quoted as a specimen of the
‘ decor' which the man speaks of. The
meaning of it, if it ever had any, is not so
easy to explain. The poet may be speaking
of crossing the Apennines, but without
the context it is impossible Ι think to
811055 with any probability what he means.
The same 111311 8005 011 to ask whether the
Aeneid (which according to a common
practice he calls by its first words) is not
like an old 11011811 with a fat rind, and dried
up with a great bark; which language
has not much more meaning, as he applies
it, than his fine quotation. ‘Spumosum
ct cortice pingui' is explained by what
Pliny says (H. N. xvii. 24) : “ aliquae vero
(arbores laborant) et obesitate3 ut onmia
quae resinam ferunt nimia pinguitudine in
tedam mutantur, et cum radices quoque
pinguescere coepere intereunt, ut animalia,
nimio adipe.” Here thenis meant a branch
of which the sap or rcsin has oozed out
and choked the pores, and formed the bark
into a dry swollen mass.

97. praegrandi subere coctum '?] The
Scholiast 011 Horace (S. i. 2. 129: “ve-
pallida lecto Desiliat '') quotes this line of
Persius: he read ‘vegrandi subere coctum. '
Servius so quotes its on V· 118. Αο11. xi. 552,
and‘ vegrandi’ has some MSS. to support
it. Most 1131*0 ‘praegrandis and that word
15 3110 pted 111* 311 the editors Ι 11011010 but
Jahn, 11110 has‘ 1 081·ί andi? I have refeired
to this place 111 my note 011 Horace (1. c. ),
where the meaning of‘ ve' in composition
is explained.

The difficulties that have been raised
about every part of these verses (92—97)
are 5ο many that it would be tedious to
follow them. I think Heinrich is right
in his interpretation, which I have fol-
lowed. It is common to suppose ‘ Bere—
cyntius Attis’ (or ‘Atys' or ‘Attin,' as
some MSS. have it), ‘ qui—delphin, ' as
well as ‘costr ini—Ap ennino' to be speci-
mens of the 51110 1110 inan is prais ing. The
1110 next lines (96, 97) 110 gener 1111 given
to Peisius, and Jahn follows 111111 he
calls the' ingenious explanation of Meister,
who has written a treatise on the subject
(Versuch iiber Persius, S. i. vs. 92—106‚
frankfurt, 1801), and says ‘Arma virum 1³

is au exclamation of impatienee on the
part of Persius, and that what follows
relates to the stuff the other man has been
praising. Ι 500 110 ingenuity in such a
manifest blunder, and have no doubt now
about the general meaning of the passage.

98. Quidnam igilur tenerum] This is
Persius speaking. He proceeds to give a
specimen of the tender poetry as it was
countcd, poetry to be read with a laeka-
daisical air. Whether the verses are taken
from some poem of the day, or invented
by Persius, may be left uncertain. They
refer to the revels of the Bacchanals, who
were called by the Macedonians Mimal-
lones (Plut. Alex. c. 2): they were also
named Bassarides‚ after their god, who
was called Bassareus (Hor. C. i. 18. 11).
Maenades (μαίνομαι) was their commonest
tit-le. ‘ Bombus ² is the usual word for the
souud of 3 trumpet. Catullus (lxiv. 264)
has a verse like the first of these z “ Multi
raucisonis efflabant cornua bombis.” In
the same passage, which refers like this to
the orgies of Bacchus, he says (v. 258)
“Pars e divulso raptabant membra ju-
veneo ’³ (or ‘jactabant ³). ‘Superbo' Jahn
and others say is explained by ταῦροι δ’
ὑβρισταὶ κείς κέρας θυμούμενοι (Eurip.
Bacch. v. 743). The Scholiast I think is
right in saying Pentheus and'Agave his
mother are meant. Pentheus is called by
Ovid “ex omnibus 1111115 Contemptor Su-
perum '' (Met. iii. 513). His mother mis-
took him for a beast. Ovid says a boar,
Euripides a lion. Here he is a calf. The
Maenad is represented as mounting the
chariot of Bacchus drawn by lynxes, har—
nessed with ivy, and raising the bacchanal
cry (Hor. C. ii. 19. 7): “Euoe parce, Liber,
Parce, gravi metuende thyrso.” Bacchus
is ‘the Shouter,' and this was his cry.
‘ Reparabilis’ is used actively (500 J uv. xv.
1⁴3, n.). It means ‘reproducing.' G. J.
Vossius (de poet. lat. p. 43) is indignant
with Persius for ridiculing these lines,
which he says are better than his own.
Perhaps they were his own. Casaubon
thinks they are Nero's. Dion mentions a
poem of the emperor's entitled Bacchae.
The Scholiast too says these verses are
Nero’s. I do not believe it.
