D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Sic libitum vano qui nos distinxit Othoni.

Quis gener hic placuit censu minor atque puellae

Sarcinulis impar? quis pauper scribitur heres?

Quando in consilio est Aedilibus?

Agmine facto

Debueram: olim tenues migrasse Quirites.
Haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat

Res angusta domi : sed Romae durior illis

Conatus 3 magno hospitium miserabile, magno

told by Varro was worn by the Samnites,
another class. The name is not found else—
where. ‘ Lauistae ' were the persons who
trained the gladiators in their ‘ ludi‚’ train-
ing-schools, either on their own account to
let them out, or for private persons.

160. censu minor] Less than the eques-
trian above mentioned, or it may be taken
generally for a man of small means. ‘ Sar-
cinulis ' the Scholiast explains by ‘ (los‚' and
Forcellini by ‘ doti et opibus‚’ which is not
satisfactory. The ‘ dos ' was not given by
the husband, but it means every thing
which on the occasion of a woman's mar-
riage was transferred by her, or by another
person, to the husband for the purpose of
enabling him to sustain the charges (onera)
of the marriage state. Achaintre, with
Ruperti's appi-oval, explains ‘ sarcinulis '
by the French word ‘ trousseau,' which is
the stock of clothing given to a woman ou
her marriage. Perhaps the word may
only mean such things as a woman required,
or thought she required, after her marriage,
and ‘impar’ means that the man’s property
was unequal to provide his wife with such
things. The word is repeated iu vi. 146 ε
“Collige sarcinulas dicet libertus et exi,”
‘ pack up your baggage and be gone‚' where
a man is turning his wife out of doors.
There is something of contempt in it. Here
the speaker means that a poor man who
cannot afford to keep his wife in trinkets
and finery is passed by. The Scholiast and
others suppose ‘impar ' to be a word of
eomparison, that 1115 means are not equal
to the woman's, which is perhaps not the
meaning.

162. Quando in consilio est Aedilibus 12]
That is, assessors to the Aediles, who were
at this time and had been for many years
the lowest of the magistrates. Even in
Cicero’s time the office was little above the
condition of a private citizen, as he says (in
Verrem, Act. i. 0. 13, init.), when he himself
was Aedile‚“ego autem 30111115,1100 est, paulo
amplius quam privatus.’' (See note above
on v. 31.) They were police-Officers now,

and nothing more. ‘ In consilio ’ is equi-
valent to ‘assessor,' and that means a legal
adviser to a magistrate, such as our own
magistrates have. The assessor to an Aedile
need be but a humble person, but even to
this a poor man was not eligible, according
to this speaker.

163. Debuerant olim] The commentatore
refer this to the ‘ secessio plebis,' Rc. 494,
when the plebs retired to the Mons Sacer
iu a body, but were induced to return by
the representatious of Menenius Agrippa.
But ‘Debuerant olim migrasse ' means ‘ it
is long since they had owed it (to them-
selves) to emigrate? The construction is
like that in ii. 1 l5‚“tempus eratjam abrum-
pere.'' ‘ Olim ³ carries the mind back to a
past time, and the past perfect means that at
that time the duty had long lain upon them.
This is decisive against the above allusion,
which, as the time is specific, would have
required the perfect ‘debuerunt’ either with
¹ migrare ' or ‘ migrasse-³ (See Kcy's L. G.
1257, 1258.) All that is reallymeant is, that
the poor ought not to have waited at Rome
to be brought to this contemptible condition,
but long ago to have migrated in a body, as
he and his family were doing, and as the
Irish have been doing for some time. ‘Ag-
mine facto ³ is a common phrase borrowed
from Virgil, who uses it repeateffly, of bees,
of the winds. and of soldiers. Juvenal uses
it again for swarms of diseases (x. 218).

164. H aud facile emergunt] “ Slow rises
worth by poverty depress'd,” is J ohnson's
version, and he wrote from experience. Lu-
cretius (ii. 12) says it is pleasant for those
whom philosophy has raised above the vul-
gar sort to look on and see men

“ Noctes atque dies niti praestante labore
Ad summas emergere opes rerumque
potiri.''
‘Emergere' means to emerge from ob-
scurity.
166. magno hospitium miserabile‚]
‘Hospitium' is here put for a lodging,
‘coenaculum‚' an upper story room in
