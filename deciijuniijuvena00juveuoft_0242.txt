tablet need not bc capax to contain a single
name,’' as Mr. Mayor sayS, for Corvinus is
only mentioned as one among many. The
abbreviation hc after ‘post ’ would account
for ⁶ posthac?

8. Fumosos Equilum] P. has this read-
ing, but the great majority of MSS. have
‘ famosos? No doubt ‘ fumosos' is right.
In the middle of the ‘ atrium ' was a
‘ focus’ round which were the images of
the Lares. The family chart would soon
get smokcd. A Dictator was 111 early
times called ‘magister populi‚' as being
elected by the ‘ populus’ or ‘eui-iae.5 With
the Dictator was always appointed another
officer subordinate to him, who was called
⁸ magister equitum,' for what reason is not
certain. Niebuhr thinks it may have been
‘⁴ that 110 was elected by the centuries of
plebeian equites, and that he was their
protector'’ (v. i. p. 570). If so elected
formerly, it was commonly left to the
Dictator to choose 1115 own colleague.

9. Si eoram Lepidis] The Lepidi were
a. branch of the Aemilia gens (v. 3), a
great number of whom held the first
offices of the state, as may be seen by the
Stemma Lepidorum given 111 the Diet-
Biog. As to ‘quo,' ‘to what purpose‚'
500 note on Hor. Epp. i. 5. 12, “Quo mihi
fortunam si non conceditur uti Ρ '³ and
below, v. 142. As to ‘alea' 500 S. i. 88,
n.‚ “ alea quando hos animos ¹? '³ Numan-
tinus was an agnomen given to Scipio
Africanus the Younger after the capture of
Numantia, B.C. 133. The plural (in 11
and 13) 15 used as in S.ii. 3, “ Qui Curios
simulant '' (where see note). There is a
good example in Cic. pro P. Sestio, 0. 681
“Quare imitemur nostros Brutos, Ca-
millos,'' &c.

13. Cur Allobrogicis] Q. Fabius Maxi-
mus was surnamed Allobrogicus from his
victory over the Gallic tribe Allobroges
in the year of his consulship, B.C. 121.
The Fabia gens were said to be descendants
of Hercules: Νυμφῶν μίας λέγουσιν, οἶδὲ
’γυναικὸς ἐπιχωρίας Ἡρακλεῖ μιγείσης περὶ

15

τὸν Θύμβριν ποταμὸν ’γενέσθαι Φάβιον,

ἄνδρα πολὺ καὶ δυκιμὺν ἐν Ῥώμῃ τὸ Φαβίων ·

’γένος ἀφ’ αὑτοῦ παρασχόντα (Plutarch,
vit. Fabii, 0. i.). Ovid (Fast. ii. 237) calls
them ‘ Herculea gens ' (“ natus in Herculeo
Lare '') ; and writiug to Fabius Maximus,
his patron (Ex Ponto iii. 3. 99), 110 says:

“ Conveniens auimo genus est tibi, nobile
namque
Pectus et Herculeae simplici tatishabeS.'’

The Ara Maxima, an altar near the Forum
Boarium, was said to be that which Her-
cules built after he had killed Cacus. See
Ovid (Fast. i. 581) :

“ Constituitquc sibi, quae Maxima dicitur,
aram,

11110 bulei5 pars urbis de bove nomen
a 0 . ’

Other traditious made Evander the builder
of it. See Livy i. 7 ; ix. 29. Virg. viii.
271. Tac. Anu. xii. 24: “igitur a foro
boario sulcus designandi oppidi coeptus
ut magnam Herculis aram amplecteretur?
Tacitus says it was burnt down in Nero’s
great fire (Anu. xv. 41). Juvenal says,
Why should any degenerate Fabius pride
himself on his ancestor Allobrogicus and
the altar of Hercules (in which he was
especially interested as a descendant of
Hercules) if he was avaricious‚ silly, soft-
hearted, effeminate, a murderer ?

15. Euyanea quantum-is mollior ayma]
The Euganei were originally the occupiers
of all the country which the Veneti after-
wards possessed and gave their name to
(Livy i. 1). The Euganei were driven fur-
ther west and south to the Athesis
(Adige), and beyond that river between
the lakes Benacus (Lago di Garda) and
Sebinus (Lago d'Iseo). We do not hear
elsewhere of their flocks‚ but all that
region was faximus for its pastui-es 3 “ pin-
guia Gallicis Crescunt vellera pascuis ’'
(Hor. C. iii. 16. 35). But Juvenal pro-
bably uses the name widely, and may have
had in mind the wool of Altinum (a Vene-
