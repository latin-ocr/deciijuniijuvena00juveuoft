A. PERSII FLACCI

Dividit in Geminos concordia fata duorum,

Saturnumque gravem nostro Jove frangimus una :

50

Nescio quod certe est quod me tibi temperat astrum.
Mille hominum species et rerum discolor usus,

Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur 11110.

Mercibus hic Italis mutat sub sole recenti

Rugosum piper et pallentis grana cumini,- 55

Hic satur irriguo mavult turgescere somno ;

as twins ; each, that is, had the same length
of days and the same fates to fulfil. This
is all poetical talk, and Persius believed in
such matters 110 111010 than Horace. Cor-
nutus lived to go into exile some years
after his pupi] had died an early death (see
Introduction). The 0110 was born a stranger
and came to Rome a slave, the other was
connected with the first families in the city,
and boasted a long line of noble ancestors.
¹ Libra ’ and ‘ Geminos ³ refer to the con-
stellations of those names.
Manilius says (ii. 631, sq.) ι

Of the latter

“Magnus erit Geminis amor et concordia
duplex,
Magnus et in multos veniet successus
amicos.'’

Ver. 50 is explained by the above passage of
Horace. Jove was thcirs, and under the
auspices of his planet they destroyed the
adverse influences of Saturnus. ‘ Me tihi
temperat‚’ ‘ tempers me with you‚' that is,
fits and joins me to you. Following the
conjecture of Mitscherlich on Horace, C. ii.
17. 22, Heinrich has ‘ Saturnumve.'

52. Mille hominum species] He goes 011
to shoiv‚ in contrast to the union between
him and his friend, the diversity of tastes
and feclings to be found in the world. ‘ Re-
rum discolor usus' means ‘various expe-
riences of the world.’ ‘ Velle ' is used as a
noun. (S. i. 9, n.) Pepper came from
India to the emporia of Syria or Egypt,
where it was shipped for Rome. (See be-
low, 136, n.) Its dry appearance is ex-
plained by ‘mg-osum? Horace speaks of
“exsangue cuminum '' (Epp. i. 19. 18).
The Scholiast quotes Horace (S. i. 4. 29),
“ Hie mutat merces surgente a sole.''

56. Hic satur irriyzto] ‘ Satur’ means
with his belly full, asin Juv. vii. 62. Sleep,
Heyne says, is called ⁵ irriguus,' from the
poetical notion of its falling like dew upon
the weary body.
Aen. i. 691, “At Venus Ascanio placidam

See his note on Virg.

per membra quietem Irrigat‚'’ which ex-
pression Virgil seems to have taken from
Lucretius (iv. 907), “ Somnus per membra.
quictem Irriget.'' He uses it again Aen.
iii. 511, “ fessos sopor irrigat artus.” But
here it is more probable Persius means
that the man drinks well before he goes to
bed. See Hor. S. ii. 1. 9, ‘⁶ Irrignumque
mero sub noctem corpus habento.'' ‘ Tur-
gescere ' is ‘ to get fat? The Campus Mar-
tius was covered every afternoou with men
taking exercise in various games, especially
ball. ‘ Decoquit ' means ‘makes him a.
bankrupt? The word is used elsewhere in
a passive sense, ‘to become a bankrupt.'
(See Forcellini.) ‘ ln Venerem est putris '
means he languishes or pines for that sort
of indulgence. Horace has “Omnes in
Damalin putres Deponent oculos ’³ (C. i.
36. 17, n.). Heinrich adopts the reading of
one M S„ ‘ patret? Jahn, with the Scho-
liast, omits ‘ est.’ The reading of the text
is that ef most MSS. Two read ‘putrit,’
which the Scholiast mentions. Casaubon
has ‘put1·et.' ‘ Putret ' is a genuine verb,
and is like ‘the Greek σήπομαι, τήκειν, in
Theocritus. ‘ Ramalia' is in apposition with
‘ articulos? The knotty branchos of an old
beech-tree are not a bad illustration of the
joints long under thc influence of gout. In
a different sense he speaks elsewhere (i. 97)
of “ ramale vetus praegrandi subere 000-
tum.'' Horace calls the gout ‘nodosa ’
(Epp. i. 1. 31), with reference to the chalk
stenes here alluded to in ‘lapidosa.' In

‘ fregerit articulos ’ we have an imitation ”

of Horace’s “postquam illi just-a cheragra
Contudit articulos ’³ (S. ii. 7. 15). ‘ Cras-
sos dies' and ‘lucem palustrem’ express
very well the (lull unwholesome atmosphere
in which a lise of idleness and sels-indul-
gence is spent. The MSS. all seem to have
‘ chiragra 3’ but the metre requires ‘ chera-
gra ³ as Bentley says on Horace, S. ii. 7.
15. Iu 61 the MSS. have ‘ seri‚' or some
corruption os it.

quotes this verse (Nugae, sce. vii. 19), has ἵ
