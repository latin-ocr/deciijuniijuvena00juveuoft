ing or libation. Virro is the great man.
Martial, sending some earthenware to a
friend, says,

“ Quaenpstzrgrsollicitus teneat servetque mi-

Sume Saguntino pocula ficta luto '³
(xiv. 108),

where the ‘minister’ is J uvenal's ‘custos.'
42. iaspis] Pliny gives a long chapter
(xxxvii. 9) to the different sorts of jasper,
which 15 a species of quartz v ary ing through
all colours, and opaque. ‘Da veniam‚' “you
may excuse the master for 11 atching his
cupS‚ for they have rare gems on them.''
‘ Illic ’ is the reading of most MSS. Jahn
has fr0m others ‘illi’ [and Ribbeck also].
The words ‘ da veniam—iaspis ’ may be
those of the servant to the guest, ‘⁸ Excuse
me, but that cup has a fine stone on it,’'
giving him a hint, as a saucy fellow might.
45. juvenis praelatus Iarbae] That is
Aeneas, whom Dido preferred to the African
prince Iarbas and her other neighbours,
according toVirgil (Aen. iv. 36) :
despectus Iarbas,

Ductoresque alii quos Africa terra triumphis
Dives alit.”

Aeneas is called ‘juveniS‚' as Augustus is by
Horace (C. i. 2. 41, where see note). ‘ Zelo-
typus' is the Greek word for ‘jealous’ (S. vi.
2785 viii. 197). It appears only in the later
Latin writers. The stenes, he says, are the
identical jewels Aeneas had on ι “ 1111 stel-
latus iaspide fulva Ensis erat ’' (Aen. iv. 261).

46. Beneventani sutoris] A shoemaker
of Beneventum, by name Vatinius, rose by
low means to high favour with Nero ; and

it appears that his name for some reas 011
was giv en to a particular kind of cup (nasi-
terna), perhaps from its having one or inore
nozzles equ il in length to his nose, which
Martial says was a long one (xiv. 96):

“ Vilia sutoris calicem monumenta Vatini
Accipe, sed nasus longior ille fuit.'’

Tacitus says he was “inter foedissima ejus
aulae ostenta, sutrinae tabernae alumnus,
corpore distorto, facetiis scurrilibus : primo
in contumelias assumptus, deinde optimi
cujusque criminatione eo usque valuit ut
gratia, pecunia, vi nocendi etiam malos
praemineret ’³ (Ann. xv. 34).

48. poscentem ετιζΐιινα vitra] All the
authorities about glass, as used by the an-
cients, will be found in Smith‘s Dict. Ant.

50. decocta] Boiled water cooled down
with snow.

51. Non eadem vobis] Heinrich says this
verse is indescribably feeble and wholly
superfluous. It appears in all the MSS„
and the Scholiast has a note upon it. It
may be an early interpolation. The sense
is not helped by this verse. Nothing is
gained by transferring it to the place of the
forty-ninth, as Mauso proposes Some
MSS. read ‘ nobis ’ for ⁴ vobis? Ι have put
a note of interrogation at ‘quereba1·‚' which
does not however add much to the point.

“Did I coniplaiu you were
Not served with the same wine? Why see
