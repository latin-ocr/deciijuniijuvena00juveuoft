who was sold for 500 draelunac, about
171. 15³. (S. ii. 7. 43), and another offered
at eight sestertia, which was two more than
the fish eost. An inferior sort of slave, for
such purposes as this, might commonly be
bought for less than the fish. He adds,
that in the provinces men can get a large
estate for such a sum, and a larger in
Apulia, which seems to imply that land in
Apulia was eheaper than in the provinces ;
but then it must have been bad land, for
some of the corn-land of Apulia would be
valuable. [Tbere is indeed no clear meau-
ing in these words. Ribbeck has ‘ nec
majoris se Apulia venditff] The quantity
of the first syllable in Apulia is common.
Horace makes it long and short in two
consecutive lines:

“ Me fabulosae Vulture in Apulo
Altricis extra limen Apuliae.”
(C. iii. 4. 9, 10.)

28. putamus] Most MSS. have ‘ pu-
tamus: which is good Latin, as in Cicero
(de Am. c. 7) : “ stantes plaudebant in re
fleta3 quid arbitramur in vera facturos
fuisse?” Jahn has ‘putamus ς’ Ruperti
and Heinrich [and Ribbeck] ‘putemus'
The old editions are divided.

29. Induperatorem,] The preposition ‘in'
in ‘impero' (the first meaning of which
is ‘to put upon‚' ‘to impose,’ the thing
imposed being expressed or understood,
see Key's L. G. 1291, n.) is represented
in the earlier poets by the forms ‘endo'
and ‘indu,’ corresponding to the Greek
ἔνδον. The MSS. here and in x. 138, are,
with only one exception, in favour of ‘ in-
duperator.’ In other places they vary be-
tween that and ‘endoperator’ (see 1⁴¹oreell.).
Other words that are found in Lucretius
and others with the same form of the pre-
position are ‘endopedirc,’ ‘ endogredi,' ‘ en-
deplorare: ⁴ endotucri: and a few more.

30. cle maryiue coenae,] The principal
dish, ‘caput coenae‚' which at large dinners
was commonly a boar, was put in the mid-
dle of the table: ‘ de margine' corres-
ponds to a ‘ side-dish?

31. scurra Palam] The palace which
the successive emperors occupied was on
the Palatine Hill. The ruins still remain.
It was built by Augustus, and much en-
larged by his successors. Domitian spent
a great deal of money in dccorating and
enlarging it, but most of the ornaments
with which he adorned it were removed by
Trajan to the Temple of Jupiter Capito-
linus. The supposition of Henninius that
‘ palati' may mean the man's palate is
approved by Ruperti and no one else.

32. Jam princeps Equitium] This is a
way of speaking: there was no officer who
bore that title.

33.sraeta de merce siluros] Pliny (N.
H. ix. 15) mentions the ‘silurus ’ as a fish
of the Nile. It is mentioned again by Ju-
venal in S. xiv. 132. The Scholiast calls the
fish ‘sardas‚' and the translators ‘ shads,'
which is a dry sort of fish two or three feet
long found on our own coasts. ‘ Municipes ’
means that they were countrymen of Cris-
pinus. The MSS. of Ruperti and Jahn all
have ‘fracta de merce’ except one, which
has ‘ facta‚’ a clerical error, or copied from
the lemma of the Scholiast, where he has
‘ fact-ax but explains ‘ fraeta.' There have
been many attempts made to improve the
text, which Ruperti calls “ineptus,’' and
adopts ‘ fricta? a conjecture of Mauso.
‘ Fracta dc meree ' may mean that the fish
were part of a damaged lot. Heinrich says
the true reading is ‘furtin’ and that he is
referring to fish packcd in casks It may
he so. [Ribbeck has ‘ faretafj The Scho-
liast says it means that the cask was
broken that contained the lish. It might
mean that the cask was broken open to
sell the fish.
