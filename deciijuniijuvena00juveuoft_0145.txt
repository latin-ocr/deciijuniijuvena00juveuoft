parasitos See note on Hor. S. ii. 8. 20.
‘Culcita' was the cushion on which the
guest rcsted his elbow.

19. Trebius] That is, the parasite. A
dinuer now and then, perhaps once in a
eouple of months, is all the return he gets
for his early attendance at his patron's
‘salutatio' (S i. 95. 127, n.), to which lie
hurried in all haste, “ne prior officio quis-
quam respondeat ” (Hor. S. ii. 6. 24).
⁸ Ligula ' the Scholiast derives from ‘ ligo,’
which would fix the meaning of the word.
But Martial usas the form ¹ lingula ι’ “Non
hoeterna [or extrema] sedet lunata lingula
planta '' (ii. 29), and ridieules the pe-
dantry of the Grammariaus for retaining
that form while the ordinary pronunciation
was ‘ligula' (xiv. 120). The word is pro-
bably a form of ‘lingua,’ and means a
bucklc or ornament worn on the calceus.
Τὴε man in his hurry leaves his buckles
behind. Heinrich says ‘ dimittere ’ is to let
the ‘ligulae’ hang loose, taking them for
straps or thongs. ‘Peregerit orbem ’ the
Scholiast says is ‘ compleverit numerum ca-
thedrarum,' lest they should have taken all
the seats and filled the room, completed the
circle of visitors, and left no space for a
late comer. The meaning is no doubt,
⁴ lest they should have gone their round.’

22. Sideribus dubiis, aut illo tempore]
The first expresses the ezulydawn, when the
stars grow faint; the other is earlier, when
the Bear is seen slowly wheeling his wag-
gon, which is here only called ‘sarraca‚’
‘ plaustra ’ being the word generally used.
‘Sarracum' seems to have been a kind
of cart copied from the Gauls (see Smith's
Diet. Ant.). [Ribbeck has ⁸ serraca.’]
1 ‘Frigida’ is explained by the position of
the constellation ; and ‘ pigri ' Heinrich ex-
plains by Homer's ὀψὲ δύων. That and
‘tarda’ are common epitheta for Ursa ς

and more probably are taken from its np-
parent motion round the pole. Bootes,
the ⁴ herdsmam’ or ‘ team-driver,' other-
wise called Arctophylax, ‘the guard of the
bear,’ is the constellation near Ursa Major,
the Great Bear, often called Charles' Wain,
or the lVaggon. One very good M S. puts
vv. 22 and 23 after v. 20, an equally good
and perhaps better arrangement.
24. Vinum quod sucida nolit]
(or ‘succida,’ but the other is the form in
the best MSS.) ‘lana’ is wool lately cut
but not yet eleaned (see Forcell„ who quotes
Varro, R. R. ii. 11. 6: “ Tonsurae tempus
inter aequinoctium vernum et solstitium,
quum sudare inceperunt oves ; a quo sudore
reeens lana tonsa sucida appellata est ”).
It appears from Pliny (H. N. xxix. 2), that
wool in this state was used, drenched with
oil or wine or vinegar, as the case might
be, for healing applications. Juvenal says
the very wool would reject such wine. He
says also, the wine is so bad, it soon gets
into the people's heads, and sets them
quari-elling. As to the Corybantes«, the mad
priests of Cybele, sce Smith’s Dict. Ant.
26. Juryia proludunt :] ‘Prolusio’ or
‘ praelusio ’ was the word for the sham fight,
with which the gladiators began. See note
on Hor. Epp. i. 1. 2. The parasite and the
freedmau, invited like himself to their
patrou's table, are supposed to fall out and
throw the cups at one another. Earthen-
ware was imported from Saguntum in Spain.
Martial speaks of it as poor crockery :
“ Hispanae luteum rotae toreuma '³ (iv.
46). About napkins sce Hor. S. ii. 4.81, n.
[Ribbeck has omitted vv. 26 -29‚ ‘J urgia
proludunt ’ to ‘ commissa lagena.’ and has
transferred them to another part of this
Satire. The omission improves this pas-
sage, but the words ‘ de conviva Corybanta
videbis ’ are equally incongruous here.]

‘ Sucida ’
