85. Liberior Bruto .7] To be more free
than Brutus, who tirst gave his country
freedom, is as much 115 1110 1111111 can say.

-Menclose colliyis,] ‘ Your conclusion is
bad,’ 11 logical phrase. As to the next line,
see above, v. 63, 11. ‘Hic' is added to
‘ stoicus’ to give reality to the dialogue. In
v. 87 there are various readings. Most MSS.
have ‘Haec reliqua accipio? Some 1111νο
‘hoc.’ Some of the old editors and Jahn have
the formem Casanbon, l’assow, Heinrich,
and Orelli, the latter. The MSS. also are in
favour of ‘licet illud et ut volo) But there
is good authority for the reading of the text.
which is better. So Passow, Orelli, and
Heinrich think. [Jahn has the whole line
thus ε

‘Haec reliqua accipio, licet illud et ut
volo tolle.']

88. Vindicta postquam] See note on
v. 75. ‘ Vindicta' is used by Horace
(quoted in the above note) for the ‘ festuca,'
by which the act of manumission took place,
and Jahn says itis so used here. But that
is not the 01150. ‘Manumissio' was per-
formed 111 three wayS, of which one was
called Vindicta, which is explained by
Mr. Long, Dict. Ant„ Arts. Vindicutio and
Manumissio. ‘ Meus ’ is ¹ my own property‚'
or ‘ mei juris.' As to ‘ rubrica ³ 500 note
on J uv. S. xiv. 192, “perlege rubras Ma-
jorum leges.” Masurius Sabinus was a
jurisconsultus of eminence in the time of
Tiberius and his three successors. He wrote
a work of great authority on ‘jus civile ' 111
three books. To this work Persius pro-
bably refers, and ‘Masuri ruhrica' is the
law as expuunded by Masurius. ‘ Vetavit ’15
an unusual form. See note on Hor. S. i.
4. 44, “ Magna sonaturum,'' where it is

shown that these exceptional forms are not
contined to the poets. Heinrich suggests
‘vetabit‚’ which would be right ; but the
MSS. have the perfect form. Two have
‘ vetarit.' but that does not mend matters.
Au uncertain instance of ‘ vetaveram ' oc-
curs in Cicero (ad Fam. x. 23, Plancus ad
Ciceron.). But the Aldine and other old
editions have ‘vetuera1n.’

91. Disce; sed ira cadat naso] This
imperative 15 used absolutely twice before
(S. iii. 66. 73). He says if the 1111111 wants
to know he will tell him, but 110 must put
off that angry sneer that curls 1115 11050 and
wrinkles 1115 cheek, while he plucks from his
bre-ast the old grandinothers' nonsense that
110 11115 learnt. ‘ Veteres avias’ 5001115 to
have been a proverbial sort of expression.
St. Paul uses in the 5111110 way γραώδεις
μῦθοι, which we translate ‘ old wives' fablesss
in his first epistle to Timothy (iv. 7). The
1111111 15 spouting his nonsense in 1111 angry
and confident way, so Persius says 110 will
relieve 1115 lnngs of it all.

93. Non Praetoris erat] This uscos the
imperfect 15 occasionally met with, as in
Hor. C. i. 37. 3, “ Oruare pulvinar Deorum
Tempus crat (lapibuS, sodales '’ (where see
note), and C. i. 27. 19, “ Quanta laborabas
Charybdi? Here ‘ crat ¹ means the Prac-
tor has not and never had the power
to instruct fools in the subtleduties of life,
esoteric (1111105, 115 1110 philosophers might
call them, only to be learnt iu the 50110015,
or to teach them how to use their short life.
With the Stoics 1111 were fools who were not
wisc aster their snshion. See note on Hor.
