“ Tibi habe fruinentum,” Allidius inquit,

“ O Libye, disjunge boves dum tubera mittas.”

Saltantem spectas et chironomunta volanti

Omnia.

Neo minimo sane discrimine refert,

Quo gestu lepores et quo gallina secetur.

Duceris planta velut ictus ab Hercule Cacus,

mis sent ‘to lay waste his native place, is
told by Homer (ll. ix.). Virro's boar was
a worthy companion sor this monster. A
boar served up whole was commonly the
chief dish (⁸ caput coenae‚' see i. 140). The
firttening of fowls (altiles) and the livers of
gecse was carried to perfection by these
Romans. See Hor. S. ii. 8. 88 ε “ Pinguibus
et ficis pastum jecur anseris albae.’' And
Epp. i. 7. 35 z “ Nec somnum plebis laudo
satur altilium.'’

116. tradentur inherm] Most MSS-have
‘ raduntur ' or ‘ radentur ' (as in S. xiv. '7 ε
“qui radere tubera terrae—didicit''), that
is, are peeled or scraped. P. has ‘ traden-
tur,’ which, or ‘ traduntur' (the reading of
other good MSS), is no doubt the proper
word. ‘'Pubera’ were great (1011030105 with
the Romans. WVhether they were what
we know as the ‘ tuber cibarium‚' or com—
mon truffie, has been doubted. They 0311-
not have been very different. ‘Optata toni-
trua ' is explained by 3 passage from Pliny :
‘⁶ De tuberibus 11300 traduntur peculiariter.
Cum fuerint imbres autumnales 30 tonitrua
crebra tunc nasci et maxime e tonitrubus:
tenerrima autem verno esse '' (H. N. xix.
3). From this notion about the thunder it
was called ‘tuber ceraunium.' The ‘tuberes’
mentioned by Martial (xiii. 42, 43), and re-
ferred to by Ruperti, were a sort of apple,
as Pliny shows (xv.14): and, as Martial
says they grew upon trees, Ruperti need
not have been deceived. Pliny (xix. 2)
says the best ‘tubera’ came from Africa. The
epicure Allidius (which name is variously
written Alledius, Aledius, Atidius) wishes
all Libya, the greatest granary of Rome,
would turn her corn-fields into truffle
grounds. He is introduced in aparenthesis.

120. Structorem] This is the name of
the man whose business it was to ar-
range (struere) the table (Hor. S. ii. 6.
107, n.). It is also used for the person who
carved the meat, otherwise called ‘ 5015501· ’
01· ‘ carptorf The latter is here meant.

It appears that great men in this depart-
ment carved with various fantastic move-
ments of the arms and legs, flourishing their
knife about, as here described. Petronius
speaks of one doing 1115 work to the souud
of music, but his account is a parody (see
Ruperti 011 this place). These persons were
trained under regular professors (see below,
xi. 136, sqq). ‘ Chironomunta ' is the
Greek participle Οῗχειρονομέω,1ῗο throw the
arms in time. The form ‘-munta' is that
found in the Scholiast and P. It is right,
corresponding to -μοῦντα, Most MSS.
have ‘-monta.' ‘ Dictata ' are the lessons,
and ‘ dictare' is to teach3 because it was
usual for the master to read aloud to his
scholars that which they had to learn and
repeat: “ Ut puerum saevo credas dictata

magistro Reddere '³ (Hor. Epp. i. 18. 13).

“ ——carmina Livi

. . . . memini quae plagosum mihi parvo
Orbilium dictare.'' (Epp. ii.1. 70.)

“ Haec recinunt juvenes dictata senesque '³
E 111. 1. 1. 55).

( iel. Saltanlem spectas] This is the
reading of nearly all the MSS. Ruperti
and Jahn have ‘spectes’ without- autho-
rity. [Ribbeck also has ‘spectes.’]

123. Neo minimo sane] “And doubtless
it is of importance, and makes no little
difl'erence with what gestures? &c.

[After v. 124, ‘ gallina seeeturss Ribbeck
has placed vv. 166—169, from ‘ Spes bene’
to ‘pane tacetis? After ¹ pane tacetis’ he
indicates that there is a ‘lacuna,’ and after
this supposed lacuna he places vv. 146-
155, from ‘ Boletus domino’ to ‘ torquere
capella.5 After ‘torquere capella’ he in:
dicates another lacuna, and then inserts
vv. 26—29‚ froin ‘Jurgia proludunt ' to
‘ commissa lagena.5 See above, note 26.]
