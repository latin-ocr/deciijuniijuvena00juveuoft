of living together at one time. ‘ Crudum
abrodens' is biting or tearing it to the
quiek. He asks if he should continue to
oppose the good conusel of his sober rela-
tions and be a (lisgrace to them. ‘ Siccis '
is used by Horace in this sense, C. i. 18. 3,
“ Siccis omnia nam dura Deus proposuit.'’
‘Rem frangere' is also used by Horace, S.
ii. 3. 18, “ Postquam 01111115 res mea J 31111111
Ad medium fracta est.'' ‘ Limen ad obscoe-
num ’ is like ‘invisis foribus ’ in the same
satire, v. 262.

165. udas Ebrius anz‘e sores] Lorers
poured wine 011 111011 mistresses’ doors, or
daubed them with swcet ointment. In
the first scene of Plautus' Curculio, Phae-
dromus pours wine on the door of his mis-
tress and says,

“Agite, bibite, festivae fores!
Potate, fite mihi volentes propitiae.”

Lucretius (iv. 1177) 1135

“At lacrimans exclusus amator limina
saepe

Floribus et sertis operit, postesque su-
perbos

Unguit amaracino, et foribus miser oscula
figit?

Martial (x. 13) has

“Ad nocturna jaces fastosae limina moechae
Et madet, heu! lacrimis janua sur-
da tuis.'’

So in Ovid (Metam. xiv. 708, sqq.) Iphis
weeps at the doors of his Trojan love:

“Interdum madidas lacrimarum rore 00-
ronas

Postibus intendit, posuitque in limine
duro

Molle latus‚tristique serae convicia fecit.’'

His torch was among thc lover's arms which

121ῗ3 t(giered to Venus, in Horace (C. iii.

170

 

Hic hic ponite lueida
F unalia et vectes et arcus
Oppositis foribus minaces.''

A pitiful serenade sung by a despairing
lover before his mistress’s door, is the tenth
ode of Horace's third book, beginning “Ex-
tremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce.'' Ovid
(Fasti, v. 339) has

“ Ebrius ad (lurum formosae limen amicae
Cantat; liabent unctae mollia serta
comae.”

167. Euye, puer; sapia8,] The slave
applauds his master's intention, and bids
him be wise, and sacrifice a lamb to the
gods averters of evil, ‘ dii averrunci‚’ as they
were called, 01· by the Greeks ἆποτρόπαιοι,
ἀλεξίκακοι. The gods universally received
in this character were Jupiter and Apollo,
and among the heroes, Hercules and the
Dioscuri. But individuals had their own
protecting gods, and for particular evils
there were particular divinities‚ which took
their names from the ills they averted, as
Febris, Robigus, Timor, and. others. ‘ Sa-
11135, percute ² is like Horace's “ SapiaS,
vina liques et spatio brevi Sp’em longam
reseces ’' (C. i. 11. 6).

168. Sed eensen' plorabit‚] He begins to
110511310, 311(1 we know what that leads to
under such circumstances. The slave tells
him 110 is a fool‚ and if he goes back she
will beat him with her slippen “Utinam
tibi commitigari videam sandalio caput‚”
{Sys Gnatho to the valiant captain (Ter.

un. v. 7. 4).

170. Ne trepidare velis] According to
the usual punctuation thisverse is separated
from the one before it by a full stop. This
makes the words a bidding of Davus. Ι do
not take it so. The woman he says will
beat him with her slipper and teach him not
to fret and bite his toils. As to ‘ trepidare,’
which expresses confusion in various wayS,
