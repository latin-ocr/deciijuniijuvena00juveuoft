SATIRA lI.

Nemo repente venit turpissimus : accipient te
Paullatim qui longa domi redimicula sumunt

Frontibus, et toto posuere monilia collo,

Atque Bonam tenerae placant abdomine porcae
Et magno cratere Deam 3 sed more sinistro
Exagitata procul non intrat femina limen :

Solis ara Deae maribus patet.

Clamatur ε “ nullo gemit hie tibicina cornu.'’

Talia secreta coluerunt orgia taeda
Cecropiam soliti Baptae lassare Cotytto.
Ille supercilium madida fuligine tactum
Obliqua producit acu pingitque trementes

and had these mock ceremonies to them-
selvae. Roman women wore very hand-
some necklacoe of all kinds. Specimens are
given in the Dict. Ant„ Art.‘)10nile.’ ‘ More
sinistro‚' ‘ in perverse fashion‚’ means that
they reversed the proper practice.

83. Nemo repente venit] ‘Venit‚' in the
sense of ‘ evenit,’ is used below in vii. 29:
“ Ut dignus venias hederis et imagine
ωεστ-αἶ’ Ruperti and Heinrich both adopt
it here, though only two MSS. have yet
been found to favour it. All other editions
have ⁴ fuit ς’ some MSS. have ‘ fiat.' I
prefer ‘venit' to ‘ fuit! ‘ Redimicula’ was
the name of various kinds of fillets and ri-
bands worn by women on the head. Ri-
bands streaming from the cap or net in which
the hair was tied up were so called. ‘ Ite pro-
fanae ' is a burlesque of the proclamation of
the priaet ordering away all the uniuitiated
when the mysteries were to begin, like
Horaoe’s ‘Odi profanum vulgus et arceo'
(C. iii. 1. 1, note, where the parody of Aris-
tophanes, Frogs‚ 353, sqq. is quoted). The
festival of Bona Dea or Fauna, who was a
Roman diviuity, andconnected with Faunus,
was held yearly on the lst of May, on the
Aventine, and conducted by the vestan, as-
sisted only by women. lVine was set in
a large bowl, supposed to contain milk and
honey, and out of this the women not only
poured libations, but drank freely, which
Juvenal says was notorious (vi. 314, sqq.).

91. Talia secreta coluerunt orgia taeda]
He says that these impious rites were like
the myster-ies of Cotys or Cotytto, a Thra-
cian divinity‚ whose festival was imported
into Greece and from thence into Sicily.
The Romans do not appear to have been ac-
quainted with it, except from report. She is
called ‘ Cecropiam ’ from her worship having
been introduced at Athens Βαπταὶ was

the name of her priests. The carrying of

torehes was common to all such festivals,
which were celebrated by night. The rite-s
of Cotytto were mysteries, and might not.
be divulged. (Horace, Epod. xvii. 56, n.)
Milton refers to them in words partly bor·
rowed from Juvenal ε

“ Dark veiled Cotytto, to whom the secret

Of ngdiiiiegbt torches burm, mysterious

That tiliPeei·² art called but when the dragon

Of Sltlypglrliirib darkness spits her thickest
gloom .'' (Co m us.)

[After v. 90, Ribbeck places vv. 110-
114, ‘ Hic nullus' to ‘conducendusque ma
gister,' and so these verses come between
‘ tibicina cornu ’ and ‘ Talia secreta.’ He
also makes these five verses a continuation
of the supposed address which begins, “Ite
profanae.’' v

After ‘ lassare Cotytto ' v. 91, he places
vv. 115, 116.]

93. Ille supercilium] Here follows a gra-
phic description of the way these wretches
proceed. One blaeks his eyebrows with
soot, and extends them by the same means,
using a crisping pin for the purpose. Pliny
(H.N. xxviii. 11) says that the Romans used
bears'grease for the purpose of restoring the
hair of the head and eyebrows, “cum fungis
lucernarum et fuligine quae est in rostris
earum,'’ that is, with the burnt part of the
wick, and the soot which accumulates on the
rim of the lamp. ‘Obliqua acu ’ means with
a needle drawn across it. They painted
their eyelids with a powder called by the
Septuagint translatore στίβη, and by the
Romans ¹ stibium? Pliny says that it was
a white stone found in silver mines, and-
that it was called by many ‘ platyophthal-
mon‚’ because it had the effect of making
