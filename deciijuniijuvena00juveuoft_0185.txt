Semper habet lites alternaque jurgia lectus
In qno nupta jaeet; minimum dormitur in illo.

Tum gravis illa viro, tunc orba tigride pejor;

Tum ‹sinuilat gemitus occulti conseia faeti,
Aut odit pueros, aut licta pellice plorat,
Uberibus semper lacrimis semperque paratis
In statione sua atque exspectantibus illam

Quo jubeat manare modo : tu credis amorem,

Tu tibi tunc, curruca, places fletumque labellis
Exsorbes, quae scripta et quas lecture tabellas,
Si tibi zelotypae retegantur scrinia moechae !

Sed jacet in servi complexibus aut equitis.

gens ; but none were so distinguished as
M. Aemilius Lepidus. He was consul,
A...Uc 567, and again in 5793 Pontifex
Maximus, 57³4 Censor, 573; and died 602
at a great age. He built tlie bridge men-

tioned in v. 33, and carried out other great
public works during his censorship. L

Caecilius Metellus, who lost his sight in
rescuing the Palladium from the temple of
Vesta, has been mentioned before on S. iii.
1392 “ Servavit trepidam flagranti ex aede
Minervam.'' Q. Fabius Maximus, probably
the grandfather of Fabius Maximus Cunc-
tator, Hannibal’s opponent, was surnamed
Gurges, from his dissipation as a young
man. He was consul first 111 A.U.c. 462,
and again in 481. 111 both years hc was
successful against the Samnites, and had
triumphs. Asylus must have been the name
of a gladiator sufficiently well known to be
proverbial.

268. Semper habet lites] He goes on
to speak of curtain-lectures as they are
called, a common subject for amusement.
Hc describes the woman as flying at her
husband like a tigress robhed of her whelps,
pretending to groan over his amours,
while conscience pricks her with her own,
chargiug him with unnatural crimes (aut
odit pueros), or with keeping a mistress,
with a plentiful stock of tears only waiting
her directions to flow, like soldiers waiting
for their order83 while the man is fool
enough to think it all a sign of her love,
and kisses off her tears: but what letters
he would find if he were to open his wife’s
desk! [Ribbeck omits 274, 275. ]

276. Ta tibi tunc, curruca ,] 'lhe MSS.
vary; and the meaning of this word‘ cur-
111011301- whatever the form may be, can
only be got from scholia on this place, and
they differ. One calls it a small insect ge-

jcalous.

Dic,

nerated in beans. But he reads ‘uruca,'
and that is the word in P. The substance
of another scholium is given by Forcellini
as his idea of the meaning, that ‘ curruca '
was the name of a bird that was in the
habit of hatching other birds' eggs as if
they were her own. Forcellini adds that
whatever the meaning may be, the word is
not Latin. Heinrich has said much, and
all that is wanted on the subject. Jahn has
Uruca, following the first-mentioned Scho-
liast, who says it was the name of a stupid
mimologus, who always hroke down in
acting the part of a husband.

277. et qaas Zeelure tabellas,] This way v
of using the vocative case is uncommon.
Heinrich quotes Persius (iii. 28) :

‘⁶ Stemmate quod Tusco ramum millesime
ducis,

Censor-epi, fatuum vel quod trabeate sa-
lutas.

where Casaubon says it is a common con-
struction both 111 Greek and Latin. Not Ι
think as we have it in these two places,
where the nominative would no doubt have
been used but for the metre. The MSS.
and editions vary between ‘'quot and

‘quas The quality is of more conse-
quence than the quantity, and Msciipta’
and‘ tabell as' are the same subject.

278. Si tibi zelotypae] As to ‘zelo-
typass see S. v. 15. She pretends to be
‘Capsa' and‘ scrinium’ were the
names of book and letter boxes.

279. in servi complexibus aut equitis]
High or low she is not particular. It seems
to he a proverbial way of speaking. [Rib-
beck omits this line, and it might be
omitted without any injury to the sense.
But the meaning is clear, and the line adds
force to the passage. Her letters, if they
