Tangit ct admissus circum praecordia ludit,
Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso,
Men’ mutire nefas? nec clam uec cum scrobe, nusquam.

Audaci quicunque afflate Cratino

Iratum Eupolidem praegrandi cum sene palles,

Aspice et haec si forte aliquid decoctius audis.

Inde vaporata lector mihi ferveat· aure,

dens omnia naso ' quoted on v. 41 above.
To turn up the nosc and hang the object
of ridicule upon it is a eurions expression.
Persius plainly borrowed it from Horace.
‘ Excusso ’ the Scholiast and most of the
commentators explain as cquivalcnt to
‘emuncto,' used by Horace in describiug
Lucilius (S. i. 4. 8, “Einunctae naris’'),
which means a man with a clean nosc, no
driveller, but a elever fellow. F orccllini
does not notice this place. Heinrich un·
derstands ‘ excusso’ to mean ‘sursum jac-
tato,’ like ‘excussa brachia ' (Ov. Met. v.
596). So it is more like “ naso suspendis
adunco Ignotos '² (Hor. S. i. 6. 5). Ι in-
cline to this explanation.
119. Men' mutire nefas ἲ]
to say ‘mu‚’ and means to mutter or speak
under the breath. Ovid tells this story of
Midas and his ass's ears (Met. xi. 180,
sqq..) He was so ashamed of them that
he took pains to hide them under his
turban. But the barber who cut his hair
found them out, and the man wishing yet
fearing to publish the secret went and dug
a hole ιιι the earth, into which he whis-
pered it, and covering the hole he went
away. But reeds sp prung up ov er the spot,
and when shaken by the wind betrayed the
words of the barber. This· is what Persius
refers to in “ nec clam nec cum scrobe ;”
which last is Ovid's word, “et scrobibus
tacitus secedit opertisss’ The editors do
not all agree in the punctuation of v. 119.
‘Nec clam nec cum scrobe, nusquam? is
Persius’ answer to himself. A (1³)1s not
wanted after these words.
120. Hie tamen infodiam. ]
same idea continued. He says he will
bury what he has to say here, that is in
his poem, which he personities and ad-

‘ Mutire ' is

This is the

“ dresses as if the book were the hole in

which he meant to dep osit the great
secret he is going to tell. In the life of
Persius attributed to Suetonius it is said

that he wrote ‘ Mida rex habet,' and that
his friend Cornutus after his death crased
‘Mida rex ’and put in‘ quis n0n,' which
would he a conventioual way of saying
that ex ery one has.'1'he MSS. ‘ill have
‘quis non, 'and till Casaubon every edition
had the sanie. His reading ‘Mida rex’
still stands alone 1 believe.

121. Hoc eyo opertum,Hoc ridere meum]
He says he will not give this secret and
laugh of his, worthless as they may seem,
for any Iliad in the world. He refers to
the Iliad of Accius Labeo (see Persius i.
4. 50, n.). As to the infinitive ‘ridere’
see note on v. 9 above.

123. Audaci quicunque afflate Cratino]
He goes on to appeal to those who are
familiar with the old coinic writers of
Athens, saying they will read his satires.
He joins Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristo-
phanes together, as Horace had done, S.
i. 4. 1: “ Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristo-
phanesque poetae? Horace calls Lucilius

‘senex ² (S. ii. 1. 34, n.), and others, with-
out reference to their age. Persius in the
{iffeexff'ay‘fflssffisstssfii‘issetshlpvrssssffiavssdiss
agree with ‘ tu' as below (iii. 28, 29). A
similar construction is in Horace (S. ii. 6.
20) : “ Matutine pater seu J ane libentius
audis. '' ‘ Palles, ³ which is commonly used
with an accusative, means to get pale with
studying these great old satirists. ‘Ali-

quid decoctius’ is‘ something more refined
than usual!

126. Inde wporata] Inde’ is ‘by these
means,' by reading these writers, and ‘vapo-
rata aure' is an ear warmed, inflamed‚ ns
Heinrich says. Casaubon takes it in the
same sense as ‘ purgatas aures ' in S. v. 63.
2Jahn takes it the same way, referring to

‘aurem mordaci lotus aceto'' (v. 86), but

‘vaporata' contains quite a different idea.

‘Ferv eat' expresses the warmth of the
reader’s admiration. He is supposed to
