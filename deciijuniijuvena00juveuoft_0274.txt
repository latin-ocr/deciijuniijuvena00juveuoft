111100 to four in the morning. The iirst
crowing was at midnight. Between the
time called ‘ gallicinium' and the rising of
the sun (ante diem) was called ‘ diluculum.’
In 1110 Gospels of Matthew and Luke our
Lord says to Peter, “ Before. the cock crow
thou shalt deny me thrice.” Mark, writing
at Rome aud for Romans (as is supposed),
makes our Lord say, “Before the cock
crow twice.'' The time meant is the same,
that is the hour at which the cock erows
the second time, which was conventionally
understood as the hour of cock-erowing.
Aristophanes describes the same hour as
that ὅτε τὸ δεύτερον ἆλεκτρύων ἐφθέγγετ’
(Εο01. 390). St. Mark (xiii. 35) divides
the night into four 1111115, ὀψὲ, μεσονύκτιον,
ἀλεκτοροφωνῖα, πρωῒ, which was a Roman
division. ‘Ante diem ' means before the na-
tural day of twelve hours, which began at
sunrise and ended at sunset. The civil
day of twenty-four hours began after mid-
night, as with us, Holyday quotes from
the Poetical Husbandry of 'sussen whom
he calls “our English Varro for rura] know-
ledge,'’ the following doggerel :

“ Coek croweth at midnight times few
above six,
With pause to his fellow to answer be-
Atttlilisseteb’elock thicker 3 and then as you
Lillielciill’ unto matins, near day they do
Atciiiilliiight5 at three, and an hour yer
Tliilegv‘sutter their language as well as they
inay.'

108. audiet eb quae Finoeerzcnt] The
host of the nearest tavei-n will hear of it,
and also the lies with which it will be em-
bellished by the servants. The ⁴ librarius’
was 11151) called ‘ sc1·iba,' and was employed
in writing for his master and taking care of

1115 library (Hor. Epp. ii. 2. 5, n.‚ and above,
S. vi. 476, n.). ‘Archimagirus ¹ (ἀρχιμάγει-
pos) was the chief cook. ‘ Carptorcs ’ were.
carvers, otherwise called ‘ scissores,' and
sometimes ‘structores' (see S. v. 120, 11.).
“ 1Υ11111 charges will they not trump up
against their master, while with 1105 they
revenge themselves for the strappings they
get ?'' ‘ Baltea,’ leathcrn girdles‚ were eon-
venient instruments of punishment and al—
ways at hand.

113. vinosus inebriet aurem] This is a
curious expression. He says, Resides the
slaves, some tipsy fellow is sure to look out
for you in the street, though you would
gladly avoid him and drench your ear with
his gossip. He uses ‘inebriet ’ because it
suits the occasion. Foreellini explains it
by “ impleat, garrulitate obtundat, ut ebrii
solent.”

116. quam surrepti potare Falerni] The
genitive depends upon ‘tantum’ under-
stood. See x. 13; xiii. 31. He sayS‚ You
had better therefore ask of them what you
just now asked of me : bid them hold their
peace: but they would rather betray a
secret than 1111111( as much stolen 111110 (1110,
51100101, P uperti 5111· 5, because itis stolen)
115 Saufei· 1 111 ank at the rites of Bona Dea.
’11115 same name occurs in connexion with
these rites in S. vi. 320. There are variants
in the MSS. Laufeia, Laufela, Laufella, here
and in the other place. ‘ Pro populo fa-
ciens ' means that she was assisting at the
sacrifice for the people which the Vestals
offered 1111110 rites of Bona Dea. It was
just 111 that 111110 111111 Clodius intruded on
the rites, as noticed 011 S. vi. 337. Cic-ero
writing to Atticus (i. 13) says,‘ ‘Credo ‘oe
audisse cum apud Caesarem pro populo
fieret venire eo muliebri vestitu virum, id-
que sacrificium cum virgines iustam-assent
mentionem a Q. Cornificio in senatu fac-
tam.'' See also the 12111 101101· of the
