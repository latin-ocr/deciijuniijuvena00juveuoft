D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Proelia, tu felix ocreas vendente puella.
Hae sunt quae tenui sudant in cyclade, quarum

Delicias et panniculus bombycinus urit.

waist, as appears 111 ‘the figures above re-
ferred to. The ‘balteus’ of the Roman
soldier was passed over the left shoulder,
and fell obliquely to the right side, where
it supported a dagger or short sword.
Servius, on Virgil‚ Aen. x. 494, quoting
this verse, probably from memory, puts
‘ tunicae ⁵ for ‘ manieae.'

257. vel si diversa movebit] “ Or if she
turns to other sorts of fighting, and sells
her greavcs‚ what a fortunate fellow you
will be.'' Probably he means when she
gives up her follies in the arena and goes
back to her wautonness. The commentators
write about her giving up the arms of a
Samnite for those of some other kind of
gladiator, but there is no point in this.

259. tenui sudam} in cyclada] “ These
are the persons who, when they appear
111 their own character, give themselves
squeamish airs, afi'eet to faint under the
weight of a ‘ cyclas,’ ’³ which was a woman’s
tunic, or a petticoat of 111111 materials as it
appearS, “ and that their delicate skin (de-
licias) 15 hurt by a vest of silk.'’ The Greek
women had something they called ἔγκυκλον,
but that appears to have been an outer
dress like the ‘pallas See Aristoph.
Thesmoph. 260. Silk dresses of various
kinds, tunics, shawls, &c., were worn by
Roman ladies during the Empirc. They
were either manufactured in Europe, 05-
pecially in the island of Cos, which was
famous for this manufactum (S. viii. 101),
from material brought from the East,
or were imported from the interior of
Asia. See Diet. Ant„ Art. ‘Sericum.'
Seneca (de Benefic. vii. 9) speaks of “ Se-
ricas vestes, si vestes vocandae sunt in
quibus nihil est quo defendi aut eorpus aut
denique pudor possit; quibus sumptis mu-
lier parum liquido nudam se non esse
jurabit.”

Another instance of a false quotation
from memory is in Priscian (iii. 7. 39),
who says, “Notandum etiam ‘ pannus,'
quod ⁴ panniculus' facit ‚Iuvenalis 111 ii.:
‘quarum delicias etiam bombycinus urit
panniculus.' ''

261. Aspice quo fremitu] Like other
combatants 5110 eries out as she deals her
blows. ‘perferat' means ‘deals home?
‘Monstratos’ means the strokes she has
been taught by the ‘lanista' She wears a
helmet so large as to weigh down her head,
and great leggings up above her knees
bound with thick strips of bark. The bark
of young saplings makes the strongest
thongs. ‘ Fascia' 15 nowhere else used for
the leggings of a gladiator, but it is the
common name for such as women ordi-
narily and men sometimes wore in cold
weather. See Hor. S. ii. 3. 255, “ Fasciolas,
cubital, foealia,'' and note. It 15 1151131
10 take ‘ quanta poplitibus sedeat' for
the woman sinking on her hams ready to
spring forward. Mauso suggested the ex-
planation I have given, and Heinrich
adopts it.

264. scaphium quum sumitur] The
Scholiast calls ‘ scaphium ’ a drinking-cup,
which has no sense here. Grangaeus calls it
a woman's head-dress, which also has no
point. It is more likely that Juvenal means
such a ‘ trulla’ as we have had before (iii.
108), and that women had such suited

the granddaughters of the old worthies
whether they ever saw even an aetress or
gladiator's wife (see above, v. 104) put on
arms and 111-(101150 fencing on 3 post. Which
of the Lepidi is meant is not quite certain.
