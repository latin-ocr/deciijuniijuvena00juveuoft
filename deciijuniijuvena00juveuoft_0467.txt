SATIRA V.

1-17

Nescio qnid tecum grave corniearis inepte,
Nec stloppo tumidas intendis rumpere buccas :
Verba togae sequeris junctura callidus acri,

Ore teres modico, pallentes radere mores

15

Doctus et ingenuo eulpam defigere ludo.

Hine trahe quae dicas, mensasque relinque Mycenis

Cum capite et pedibus, plebeiaque prandia 1101·is.”
Non equidem hoe studeo, pullatis ut mihi nugis

Pagina turgescat, dare pondus idonea fumo.

20

Secreti loquimur, tibi nunc hortante Camena
Excutienda damus praecordia, quantaque nostrae
Pars tua sit, Cornute, animae tibi, duleis amice,
Ostendisse juvat: pulsa, dignoscere cautus

Quid solidum crepet et pictae tectoria- ling-uae.

14. Verba togae sequeris] ‘ Toga ’ here
means common life. As to ‘ junctura' sce
S. i. 92, n. ‘'reres,’ which is connected
with ‘tero' (Hor. C. 1. 1. 28, n.)‚ signities
‘smooth.’ ‘Ore modico' is unambitious
language. ‘ Pallentes mores’ are vicions
habits that tell upon the complexion
through conscience, or anxiety, or discase.
See above, iv. 47, “Viso si palles, im-
probe, nummo ;'’ and Horace, Epp. i. 1.
61, “Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere
eulpa.” ‘Radere' is used in this sense
above (i. 107). ‘Ingenuo ludo' is that
which he ascribes to Horace (i. 116) :

“ Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico

Tangit, et admissus circum praecordia
ludit.''

‘Defigere,' Heinrich thinks, is the hunts-
man's word to ‘ pierce 3' aud so Jahn takes
it. lt may be ‘ to nail fast? This is
nearly Casaubon’s explanation, though hc
is not certain, and the sense is doubtful.
‘ Mensas ’ is the supper of Thyestes, which
he tells him to leave, head, feet, and all, at
Mycenae (where the scene of this terrible
feast is laid), and confine his attention to
vulgar dinners, by which he may mean the
‘ prandia regum,' as lie calls them elsewhere
(i. 67). They would be vulgar compared
with the tragic feasts.

19. pullatis ut milti nuqc's] ‘Pullatae
nugae,’ the Scholiast says, are tragedics, be-
cause tragic characters were acted iu dark
dresses. (Juv. iii. 213, “Pullati procereS.”)
The Scholiast also recognizes the reading
of many MSS. and the old editions ‘ bul-
latis? The other is the right word, no
doubt, and the explanation is also right.

25

Persius says, in reply to his friend, that he
has no such ambition as this, that his page
should swell with dismal nonsense, and
aim at giving weight to smoke‚—a pro-
verbial sort of expression. ‘ Fumum ven--
dere? the proverb quoted by Jahn, has a
different meaning. As to ‘pagina ' sce
Juv. S. vii. 100, n.

21. Secretc' loquimur] We are talking
in private, and the Musc bids me offer you
here my heart to search. The Scholiast’s
explanation is not right. “ secreti loqui-
mur.- Hoc cst: ea quae scribimus (ligna
non sunt theatris—sed tibi, o Cornute, pla-
citura.’' As to ‘ Camena ' see Juv. iii. 16,
n. ‘ Excutienda ’ is explained above, S. i.
49, n. The words that follow are like
Horace's “ Et serves animae dimidium
meae,” alluding to virgil (C. i. 3. 8), and
“Ah te meae si partem animae rapit Matu-
rior vis quid moror altera ?’' (C. ii. 17. 5,
sq.)‚ addressed to Maecenas. The Greeks
and Romans had strengel· language and
warmer feelings in the friendships of man
and man than are common with us.

25. Quid solidum crepet] ‘ Solidmu' is
opposed to ‘ tectoria’ as marhle to stueco.
‘ Tectorium ' is plaster, which, like the
chunam in India, might be made to look
very like mai-hle. (See the word in For.
(rellini.) Juvenal uses ‘tectoria’ for the
plasters employed hy women, S. vi. 467.
Graevius'ooujecture of ‘ fictae ’ for ‘ pictae ’
is against all the MSS„ and ‘pictae' is
used in allusion to the colouring given to
the stucco to complete the resemblance to
marhle. ‘Solidum erepet' is like ‘ sonat
vitium ’ in S. iii. 21, and ‘mendosum tin-
niat ' below, 106.
