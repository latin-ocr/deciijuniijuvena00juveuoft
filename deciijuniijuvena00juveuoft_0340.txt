:290 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

woman's cry ε 110 sensible man thinks of that: what good would it do if he could torturc
the man to death Ρ Resides, if he wanted revenge there was conscience to do that work
for him, the haunting presence of the liar’s guilt spoiling his meals, severing his blood,
disturbing his slecp, adding terror to the thnnder and despair to sickness, hindering his
prayer-s and standing for ever between himself and the gods he has offended. No fear of
his repenting: nature will be too strong for him, and will go back to the guilt that con-
science has condemned, and so he will go from sin to remorso, aud back again to sin,
till at last hc will be caught in his own snare, and come to the punishment of the felon,
and prove to the satisfaction of the vindictive soul that the gods are neither deaf nor blind.

The satire takes the form of expostulation and ironical consolation throughout. It is
most familiarly known as dealing with the subject of an accusing conscience, which it does
in a very powerful way from v. 192 to 235. But this is only one part of the whole. The
character of the times and the contrast of the past and present occupy much of the poem,
and there is a very fine passage describing the way in which men tamper with guilt and
argue themselves into the commission of it, and put on a bold face as of innocence, from
v. 86 to 119.

Gifford says, “ Juvenal is here almost a Christian,” and he speaks of the doctrines con-
tained in this satire “ as of such pure, such sublime morality '' as “the light of nature
alone was incapable of discovering ; and which the author undoubtedly derived from that
‘ true light ' which now began to glimmer through the Roman world‚’' and more to that
effect. Ι have made a remark on this subject in one of the notes (v. 209). But for the
chronological difficulty there are many who would say that the same light glimmered in
the mind of Socrates, whose views of the supervision ot God and the power of conscience
were not less clear than J uvenal’s‚ though we have no such powerful exposition of his
ideas as we have here. There never was a time when conscience did not exist in the
mind of man, however completely the habit of guilt may have seared it in some and have
given a colour of innocence to wickedness 111 the judgment of whole communities. What
Juvenal says on the subject of conscience derives its only weight fron] its truth 3 and
though he exaggerates when he leads to the inference that the stings of a guilty conscience
must necessarily follow guilt, the picture 110 draws is taken from experience, not from
revelation, the experience of those who were no Christians and had no knowledge to
frighten them but that which was suggested from within. The soliloquy (v. 92-105) in
which a man argues away the misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the denia] of
it, represents no doubt the conduct and feelings of many who have more light than that of
conscience ; but there too the man is not a bad Christian, but a bad pagan 3 and if we are
surprised to read in Juvenal language or sentiments which if delivered fron] a Christian
pulpit would be appropriate and searching, it is because we are apt to forget that human
nature, with its desires, its corruptions, and its sels-deceptions, has always been the same
in the main, and that God has never been without his witness against guilt in the heart of
man. That revenge is nnphilosophical and vindictiveness the proof of a little mind may
be affirmed without more light than man has always possessed. But this doctrine in par-
ticular it is of which Gifford declares that “ neither Thales nor Chrysippus, no, nor his
great master Zeno ever taught or even conceived '⁵ it. How does he know this Ρ Ηο does
not add that Socrates did not act upon it, as Juvenal (who does not look to Christianity
for his examples) says he was ready to do. And if he acted the doctrine he preached
it, as, if Plato is to be trusted, he equally did in words x or if he did not Plato did it for
him, and that comes to the same thing.

The sum of this is that the reader had better take up this satire as representing the
common moral sense of mankind, and look to the law of Christianity as confirming the
unwritten law of which conscience has always been the guardian and the exponent, and
of which such writings as J uvenal's, especially this poem, are the clearest evidence.

Ruperti has pointed ont what he considers defects in this satire. He says that the
