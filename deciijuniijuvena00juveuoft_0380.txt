D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Amplior et grandes fumabant pultibus ollae.
Nunc modus hic agri nostro non sufficit horto.
Inde fere scelerum causae ς 1100 plura venena
bliscuit aut ferro grassatur saepius ullum

Humanae mentis vitium quam saeva cupido

Immodici census 5 nam dives qui fieri vult,

Et cito vult fieri.

‘⁶ Vivite contenti casulis et collibus istis,

O pueri,'' Marsus dicebat et Hernicus olim

Vestinusque senex 3 “panem quaeramus aratro
Qui satis est mensis : laudant hoc numina ruris

175
Sed quae reverentia legum,
Quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari?
180
Quorum ope et auxilio gratae post munus aristae
185

Contingunt homini veteris fastidia quercus.

Nil vetitum fecisse volet quem non pudet alto

Per glaciem perone tegi, qui summovet Euros

174. ferro grassalzcr] ‘ Οτι-115501 ' is only
another form of ‘ gradior,' and properly
means no more than ‘ to go.³ But it is
commonly used where violence is meant.
To go with the sword is to use it. [See
S. iii. 305, ‘ grassatorf]

176. [inmodici census 5]
ing of P. and a large number of MSS. aud
of Henninius' and other old editions. From
other MSS. and many editions Ruperti has
adopted ‘ indomiti? thinking “immodici

This is the read-

haud dubie ex interpretibus orta. Illam
certe librariorum ingenio deberi quis sibi
persuadeat ?'' There is weight in this argu-
ment sometimes, but not here, where ‘in-
domiti ' has no meaning. Pliny speaks of
“indomita prela’' (H. N. xvii. 10). But
the epithet is more applicable to a wine-
press than a man's fortune. It may be
observcd that Horace always uses ‘ cupido '
in the masculine gender when he is speak-
ing of the love of money.

178. properantis avari ?] See note on
S. ix. 16. Solomon says in his prover-bs,
“ He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil
eye '’ (xxviii. 22). As to ‘ metus ' see above,
v. 96, 11.

180. ΙΙΙανεαε dicebat et Hernicus] These
were all of that stock‚ the Sabellian, which
was proverbial for the severity and simpli-
city of their way of living. See S. iii. 169,
11. The Vestini reached from the Sabini
to the coast of the Hadriatic, including all
the country between the rivers Vomanus
and Aternus.

183. yratae post munus aristae] ‘After

the welcome gift of corn man despised the
old oak that once fed him with acorns.’ (See
S. vi. 10, and Horace, S. i. 3. 100: “ glan-
dem atque cubilia propter,'' dcc.) ‘Ope'
means the instruments they gave to men,
and ‘ auxilio ' is their help, teaching, favour.
Virgil has

“Liber et alma Ceres, vestro si munere
Chtaediiigm pingui glandem mutavit aris-
ta.'' (Georg. i. 7.)

And Ovid (Fasti i. 673, sqq.) says,

“Officium commune Ceres et Terra tu-
entur:

Haec praebet causam frugibuS, illa
locum.

Consortes operum per quas correcta ve-
tustas

Quernaque glans victa est utiliore
cib0.'’

185. quem non pudet] “Fictilibus coe-
nare pudet '³ (S. iii. 168). ‘Pero' was a
thick boot worn by countrymen. It came
a little above the ankle (Persius v. 102).
‘ Summovere' is a word used for sum-
mary ejectment by the lictors, and there
is meaning in the use of it here. (S. i.
37.) He puts on a skin with the hair in-
wards and then bids the cold wind begone.
He says that outlandish purple we hear of,
whatever it may be, leads only to crime
and impiety. Phoenician, Laconian, and
African purples were most esteemed.
