D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Unde nefas tantum Latiis pastoribus? unde
Haec tetigit, Gradive, tuos urtica nepotes?
Traditur ecce viro clarus genere atquc opibus vir:

Nec galeam quassas, nec terram cuspide pulsaS,

130

Nec quereris patri? Vade ergo ct cede severi
Jugcribus campi quem negligis ! “ Officium cras
Primo sole mihi peragendum in valle (5111111111.υ

Quae causa officii ? “ Quid quaeris? Nubit amicus,

Nec multos adl1ibet.” Liceat modo vivere, fient,

135

Fient ista palam cupient et in acta referri.
Interea tormentum ingens nubentibus haeret
Quod nequeunt parere et partu retinere maritos,

volves ‘divus' The sentiment is repeated in
the next Satire (v. 67) ι “ Rusticus ille tuus
sumit trechedipua, Quirine.'’ And to those
who boasted of their pedigree he says (viii.

274) 2

“ Majorum primus quisquis fuit ille tuorum
Aut ffglsgqf fuit, aut illud quod dicere

‘ Latiis pastoribus ’ refers to Romulus and
Remus, the shepherd-kings as they were
called, and their followers. ‘Ui-tica' (the
ncttle) is used for the pricking of lust only
here and in xi. 168.

129. Traditur] ‘A man of famin and
wealth is married to another man? Taci-
tus uses ‘ tradere' in the same sense (Ann.
iv. 40): “At enim Augustus filiam suam
Equiti Romano tradere meditatus est?
(Ib. c. 75) z “ Tiberius neptem Agrippinam
Germanico ortam quum coram Cn. Do-
mitio tradidisset in Urbe celebrari nuptias
jussit.”

131. patri ?] That is, to Jove. In xiii.
113 116 makes the same sort of appeal
to Jove himself that he here makes to
Mars. [Ribbeck has ‘Nec quereris patri nec
1611ἑ11]11 cuspide pulsas, Nec galeam quas-
sas .'

Vade erqo] ‘ Go then and quit the soil
of that stern field thou dost neglect‚' the
Campus Martius which bore his name,
which was the scene of the comitia, and
over which every triumphal procession
passed in the best days of Rome.

132. Officium cras] Somebody is sup-
posed to say 116 1111151 116 up early next
morning 10 attend the wedding of a friend
who lives under the Quirinal, and who is
to act bride 011 1116 occasion. ‘Nubere‚'
which signifies to put on a veil, is there-
fore only used with reference to the
woman, who wore the ‘ flameum' above

mentioned. By using the word here the
writer is not obliged to add another sen—
tence to explain the character of the mar-
riage. Martial has an epigram (xii. 42) on
the same disgusting subject, which illus-
trates this part of the satire and the forms
of a Roman marriage :

“ Barbatus rigido nupsit Callistratus Afro

Hac qua lege viro nubere virgo solet.

Praeluxere 111665, velarunt flamea vultus,

N ec tua defuerunt verba, Talasse, tibi.

Dos etiam dicta est ε nondum tibi, Roma,

videtur

Hoc satis Ρ exspectas numquid ut ct

pariat ?''

The fourth verse refers to a song which
was sung during 501116 part of the marriage
festival. ‘ Nec multos adhibet ’ means he
does not invite many friends to his mar-
riage, he was not quite destitute of shame. .

136. cupient et in acta referri] He
says, if he lives a little longer he shall see
these things which the man speaks of (ista)
going on without any concealment‚ and
even gazetted. The ‘acta diurna’ was a
published record of all the principa] events
of the day, with most of the information
that is contained in our newspapem, with
the exception of the proceedings of the
senate, which were not officially published
until the consulship of C. Julius Caesar,
Rc. 59, one of whose first acts was to es-
tablish the regular publication of the daily
proceedings of the senate (acta senatus) and
also the ‘populi diurna acta? Augustus
forbade the publication of the ‘acta sena.-
tus,’ but they were still recorded. (Sueton.
Vit. Aug. 36.)

138. relinere maritos] To retain the
affections of their husbands through their
mutual children. So Claudian writes (in
Eutrop. i. 72) :
