434 A. PERSII FLACCI

of him. He says, what can easily be believed, that Horace was almost the only Roman
lyric poet worth reading. There is no style that modern scholars have found so hard
to imitate successfully, and it appears his countrymen did not succeed better, perhaps
not so well. Quintilian adds, that if any body could be classed with Horace it was
Caesius Bassus, but his abilities were far inferior to those of some poets then living.

(Itlssoihwsshsstigersius says, we may infer that his style was none of the smoothest. From

the opening of the satire we learn that, like Horace, he had a house on the Sabine hills ;
and the Scholiast says that he had a villa in the neighbourhood of Mount Vesuyius, and
was destroyed with his house by an eruption. This waS, no doubt, in ΑΛ). 79, when
Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed, and the elder Pliny lost his life. According
to late emendations of the text of the younger Pliny, in his description of his uncle’s
death (Epp. vi. 16) the name of Bassus is introduced in that celebrated letter. Jahn
improves upon the emendations; but they are wholly conjectural, and cannot be
received, the text of Pliny being hopelessly corrupt.

ARGUMENT.

Has winter sent you to the country, Bassus? and is your lyre awake, great artist
of the rough old manly song, and that which sings of young men's passions
and of old men's wisdom ? I'm on the warni Ligurian coast, whose seas are rough
and rocks are bold, on Luna's port, which Ennius praised when he woke up from
dreaming he was Homer. Here I forget all care, and envy not the wealth of
meaner men.

V. 18. Others may differ from me, even twins are born with different genii. One turns
miser in his youth, the other runs through all his means with eating. For my part
Ι shall use my fortune, not abuse it. Live up to your means: what should you fear?
Harrow, and then your crop will come again. If duty calls, a friend cast on the
coast, with all he has sunk in the sea, you may go further: give him a slice of your
estate. But then your heir will bury you shabbily ς and cry out against luxury
brought in with our new silly tastes from the East. What! do you fear beyond
the grave Ρ Come here, my heir, a word with you. My friend, a letterrhas arrived ν
from Caesar, a great victory won, there’ll be a triumph, an things are preparing. 3
I mean to give two hundred gladiators. Who shall forbid me 3> Do so if you dare. ¹
1³11 then give largess to the people. Do you say no Ξ) Speak out. “Not 1: your
land is well nigh worthless.'' Very well 3 I’ve no relations of my own, but I can go
and find a Manius at Bovillae or Aricia. “ A son of Earth !” Well, ask who was
my father’s grandfather; it may be I could tell you: but go back two steps, and
he was son of Earth. So Manius is his brother and my uncle. You've better claims
than he, then why not wait ἒ I'm your Mercurius as they have him inthe picturas.
Refuse you what Ι offer Ρ will you not take what's left ? If aught is gone I am the
sufferer. VVhatever you may get is entire for you. Don't lecture me and bid me
live upon my income. “How much is left‚” d’ye ask? Here, boy, pour faster
oil upon my cabbage. Am I to live on nettles and pig's head that you and yours
may live in gluttony and wantonness Ρ Am I to starve that you may get a popa's
belly Ρ

V. 75. Go sell your life 3 and search the world around 3 let no man beat you at the
auction mart. Double your capital. ‘⁶ Ι have 3 it comes back triple, or quadruple‚
οι· it may be ten times more. Tell me where Ι should stop, and then we shall have
found one who can solve soriteS.”
