Da pecus et gregibus fetum !’

A. PERSII FLACCI

Quo, pessime, pacto,

Tot tibi cum in flammas junicum omenta liquescant?
Et tamen hic extis et opimo vincere ferto

Intendit z ‘ J am crescit ager,
J am (labitur, jam, jam ,³ donec deceptus et exspes

jam crescit ovile,

Nequicquam fundo suspiret nummus iu imo.
Si tibi crateras argenti incusaque pingui

Auro dona. feram, sudes et pectore laevo

Excutiat guttas laetari praetrepidum cor.

Hinc illud subiit auro sacras quod ovato

Perducis facies : nam fratres inter ahenos
Somnia pituita-qui purgatissima mittunt
Praecipui sunto, sitque illis aurea barba.

Aurum vasa Numae Saturniaque impulit aera,

Vestalesque urnas et Tuscum fictile mutat.

picture of a bankrupt speculator is well re-
presented. Jahn spoils it by his punctua-
tion, “ donec deceptus et exspes : Nequic-
quam fundo, suspiret, nummus in imo !''
The commentators quote from Seneca
(Epp. i. 4), “Sera parsimonia in fundo
est,'' ‘ economy is too late when we come
to the bottom of the cash—chest.' [Jahn
has iu v. 47 ‘flamma,³ and in v. 48 ‘ac
tamen.']

52. incusaque pingui Auro] ‘Presents
overlaid with thick gold ;' that is, with
‘emblemata‚‘' which are explained on J uv. S.
v. 38. He says if he was to offer the man
presents of this sort he would burst out
into a sweat with joy, and his beart jump
with delight and ooze out at his left breast.
‘ Pectore laevo ’ is not I think explained,
as Casaubon and others say, by “ Si mens
non laeva fuisset '' (Virg. Aen. ii. 54). It
is the same as J uvenal‘s “ Scilicet arguitur
quod. laeva in parte mamillae Nil salit Area-
(lio juveni ’' (S. vii. 159). ‘ Laetari' de-
pends on ‘ praetrepiduiu,’ ‘ in a great flutter
of joy.' ⁴

55. Hinc illud subiit] ‘Hinc' means
that because the man has this inordinate
love of gold, he thinks the gods must have
the sanie, and so he gilds the faces of their
statues. ‘Ovato auro’ is gold that has
been taken in war and paraded in the vic-
tor's triumph. Ovid (Epp. ex Pont. ii. 1.
41) has “Deque triumphato quod sol in-
cenderit aurof' As to the gilding of sta-
tues see Juv. S. xiii. 151, sq. Cicero was
honoured with a gilded statue by the people
of Capua (In Pisonem, e. 11).

56. ozam fratres inter ahenos] ‘Nam’
is used by way of introducing a ease. For
instance, ‘You must give the preference
among the gods to those who give good
dreams, so go and gild their beards.' It
is an abrupt way of speaking, in Persius'
style. who these bronze brothers may be
is a question not yet decided to every
body’s satisfaction. The Scholiast, ap-
proved by Casaubou, says, on the authority
of Acron, who must therefore have been
older, that they were statues of the fifty
sons of Aegyptus, erected opposite to those .
of the daughters of Danaus in the temple
of Apollo Palatinus. Plum supposes they
were the Hermae generally distributed
about the city. Others, as the‘ Scholiast
says, suppose Castor and Pollux. It ap-
pears to me that the bronze brethren are
all those gods whose statues are made of
bronze. ‘ Pituita purgatissima’ means
‘ most free from the disturbances of a dis-
ordered steinach 3' ‘pituita ' being phlegm
generated iu the intestines. The word is
pronounced as one of three syllables. See
notes on Hor. S. ii. 2. 73. Epp. i. 1. 108.
The ancients believed the gift of dreams,
particularly of a prophetie character, was
in the power of particular gods, ‘ di som-
niales,' among whom Apollo and Hercules
were foremost.

59. Auo-um vasa Numae] He goes on
to complain of the introduction of gold into

the temple-worship, as if the tastes of the ³-

gods were to be measured by man's. J u-

venal, referring to the ancient worship,
says (vi. 342) :
