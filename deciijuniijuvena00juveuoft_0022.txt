xvi INTROD UCTION.

Hadrian succeedcd Trajan in Aa). 117, and there is an allusion to the
silence of the oracle of Delphi in vi. 555, which makes it appear that the
Satirc was written before the reign of Hadrian, or at its commenccment,
sor lie restored that oracle which Nero liad stopped. This probably
took place during Hadrian's residence at Athens, Λ.ῐ). 123-126.

It is not certain in what years of his reign Hadrian erectcd the mag-
nificent palace near Tibur, of which the ruins still exist ; probably not
before ΑΛ). 134. But it is certain it was not built when Juvenal wrote
his fourteenth Satire, or he would have referred to it among the build-
ings he names vv. 86—91.

But the seventh Sathe, which has been the subject of so much dispute,
appears to me to bear the strongest internal evidence of having been
written in Hadrian’s reign. He was an author himself, and the patron
of authors, and Juvenal could not have said this of any of the other
emperors that preceded him without egregious flattery, of which he was
incapable. The statement of the Scholiast that in that Satire “Nero-
nem palpat ” is not worthy of notice.

The fifteenth Satire turns upon an event said to have happened
“ nuper Consule Junio ⁷' (v. 27) ⁷. It may not be possible to say with
certainty which consul J unius he refers to. But my own opinion, and
that of many others, is, that it was J unius Rusticus who was consul in
ΑΛ). 119, the second year of Hadrian’s reign. I cannot doubt that in
this Satire Juvenal refers to his own experience of Egypt during a resi-
dence there in former years. Heinrich’s pupil, Francke‚ has taken
great pains to show that Juvenal had never been in Egypt. · But he is
obliged to get rid of so many verses as spurious which Ι believe to be as
genuine as any in the Satire, that his arguments are of no value in my
opinion. It is possible Juvenal may have been in Egypt before ΑΛ). 84,
when the only other Junius, Appius Junius Sabinus, was consul, that
being the third year of Domitian's reign. In that case the whole story
of his exile by Domitian becomes a fable, as the details of it manifestly
are, unless it be said that the Satire was written in Egypt, or, if written
at Rome, that the poet had been recalled by the emperor who sent him

⁷ Jahn and C. F. Hermann, in their editions, have adopted the variant J unco for
J unio, from Pithoeus’ MS. Hermann, in his Dissertation on the seventh Satire
(Gottingen, 1843), takes Junius Rusticus for the consul, but in the preface to his
edition (1854) he argues for JuncuS, who, he says, was Consul Suffectus ΑΛ). 127. I
adhere to J unius ‚· but Hermann's date, which is eight years later, would not materially
affect the view I take of the poet’s career. J uncus does not appear in the Fasti tin
A.D. 182, and Hermann, in his Dissertation, doubts the existence of an earlier J uncus:
“ Siquidem J uncum consulem, si quis unquam fuit, non novimus ante a. 127 p. Chr.
quo suffectos certe S. Julium Juncum, Man. Vibium Servium nuper demum Clem.
Cardinalis in Actis Aead. Rom. Archaeol. 1835, T. vi. p. 240 probare conatus est?
