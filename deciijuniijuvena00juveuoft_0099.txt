Halic. mentions an occasion on which the
censor-s paid a thousand tulents to contrac·
tors for repairing and cleaning them. (See
Lipsius de Mag. Rom. iii. 12.)

On occasions when a public funeral (¹ fu-
nus indictivum’ or ‘ censorium ') wasdecrccd,
such as Tacitus often mentions, it was per-
formed through a ‘redeinptor,’ whose duty
it would be to provide mourners (men and
women), musieiaus, ‘lectica,' aud hearers,
funeral pile, and every thing connected with
the procession, buming, and burial of the
body, on such a scale as the senate might
determine. (See Lipsius’ note onTac. Ann.
iv. 15.) ‘ Busta' were places adjoining se-
pulchres, where the bodies were burnt.

A sale by auction on the public account,
as of confiscated property, or for recovery
of fines, or of the property of a man dying
without either will or heirs, or any thing
else, was called ‘sectio.' It was conducted
by a ‘praeco’ in the presence of a public
officer, and a spear was set up 011 the spot
where the auction took place. It may have
been called ‘domina' in this place because
the sale transferred to the purchaser ‘do-
minium) or ownership in the thing pur-
chased. Ruperti's conjecture of ‘dominis’
is very bad. (See Dict. Ant. ⁴ Sectio ’ and
‘Aucti0.') The spear is said to have been
derived from the practice followed in old
times in the selling of prisoners and booty
on the field of battle. ‘ Praebere ' is here
‘to put up to auction.’ The word ‘venalia’
belonged especially to slaves. Seneca (De
Ira, i. 2) speaks of passion leading, among
other mischiefs, to “totarum exitia gen-
tium et principum sub civili hasta venalia
capita? their chief men being reduced to
slavery and sold. Grangaeus and some
others take the meaning to be, ‘he who is
ready to put himself up to auction,' which
is foreign to the passage.

34. Quondam hi cornicines] These men,
who made so much money by public con-
tracta, started, he sayS, from the lowest
beginnings, as trumpeterS, who went about
with companics of wrestlers and fighters to
the different towns, where their puffed
cheeks‚ he says, were well known. See
Hor. Epp. i. 1. 49: “Quis circum pagos
et circum compita pugnax‚'’ δια, and note.
⁴ Now they give shows, of gladiatore them-

selch, and put men to death to pleasc thu
peoplc‚' who, when a gladiator had his ad·
versary down, gave the signal l'or his de-
spateh, or to sparc him, hy turning their
thuinhs up or down. (See note on Ilor.
Epp. i. 18. 66: “Fautor utroque tuuni
laudabit pollice ln‹linn.’') The number of
victims at these shows was enorinous, and
they were never inore frequent than in the
reign of Domitian. The expense lavished
on them was likewise beyond belief. Lip-
sius (de Mag. Rom. ii. 11) quotes from
Lactantius (Inst. lib. vi.): “Quid dicendum
est de iis qni populari levitate ducti vel
magnis urbibus suffecturas opes exhiben-
dis muneribus impendunt Ρ ” and from
Ambrose (Serm. 81) : “ Magistratus in
theatris, mimis, et athletis, gladiatoribus,
aliisque hujusmodi generibus hominum,
totum patrimonium suum largitur et pro-
digit, ut unius horae favorem vulgi acqui-
rat.” Half a century before this was
written, Constantine had put down gla-
diatorial shows, but they seem to -have
revived.

36. Munera nunc muna] Public games
were called ‘ munera' from the shows that
in early times were given at funerals. The
word contains the same root as μοῖρα, and
is equivalent to ‘justa‚' as applied to the
rites due to the dead. Some Mss. have
‘vulgus,’ and others have ‘quem libet,'
‘ quum libet‚’ ‘quumjubet.' Jahn has ‘vul-
gus quein jubet,' which is a compound of
these readings. P. has ‘vulgus quin libet?
The Scholiast appears to have read ‘vulgus
quum jubet' [which Ribbeck has] ς bnt his
explanation is not worth attending to. In
the reading I have adopted ‘ vulgi’ may go
with ‘quem libet' or ‘pollice’ 1 think it
is the former. The ‘editor spectaculorum’
sat in a conspicuous place within the ‘ po-
dinm‚' and it is probable the signal would
be taken from him, though he may have
followed what appeared to be the general
wish of the spectators. He might there-
fore be said very naturally, by the turning
of his thumb, to have put to death whom
he plcased of the rabhle, that is, the gladia-
tors. An old note given by Valla is to
this same effect: “ Loco imperatoris occi-
dit gladiatoreS, cum paulo ante intra gla-
diatorum fuisset numerum.''
