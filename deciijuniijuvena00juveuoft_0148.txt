D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Flos Asiae ante ipsum, pretio majore paratus
Quam fuit et Tulli census pugnacis et Anci
Et, ne te teneam, Romanorum onmia regum

Frivola.
Respice quum sities.

Quippe indignatur veteri parere clienti,

Eece alius quanto porrexit murmure panem

Nescit tot millibus emptus 60

Quando vocatus adest calidae gelidaeque minister?
Quodque aliquid poscas et quod se stante recumbas. 65

Sed tener et niveus mollique siligine factus

Servatur domino.

Juvenal says you would not like to meet
such ugly fellows in the dark‚ 111111111ος from
behind the tombs on the Via Latina, which
has becnmentioned before (note on S.i.191).

57. Tulli census puynaeis et Anci]
Horace speaks of “dives Tullus et Ancus '³
(C. iv. 7. 15, n.). Neai-ly the whole reign
of Tullus Hostilius was passed in wars with
the Albans, Sabines, and other neighbours
according to Livy (i. 22—32). As to ‘fri-
vola,’ see S. iii. 198, n.

61. miscere] To mix the wine aud water.

62. Diyna supercilia] They justify his
pride, called ‘supere-ilium? from the motion
of the eyebrow by which it is expressed.

64. Quippe indignatur] ‘ Quippe ' is
formed from ‘quia,’ as ‘nempe’ from ‘nam‚’
and both mean ‘ certainly,' ‘ of course,’ but

time two hundred slaves was 311 extrava-
gant number for one house. Soon after-
wards much lai-ger numbers were kept (see

Exe. ‘Slave Family'). Heinrich 00111113,-

this verse unworthy of Juvenal, and an in-
terpolation. I cannot see why. The Scho-
liast had it. [Ribbeck omits it in his text]

68. solidae jam] ‘ Quite hard from stale-
ness.' ‘ J am ³ means it has been left till it
has got hard.

69. Quae genuinum agitent] ‘To plague
his grinders.' The subjunctive means the
bread was given for that purpose, as ‘qui
ponere cogat' below (73), ‘to compe] you
to put it down.’

See Forceu„ who says the word
is derived from ‘gigno' or ‘gena.' The
latter probably contains the root. He also
says ‘genuini ³ are not properly speaking
‘ molares,' the ‘ grinders.'

70. mollique Siliyirzefaetus] Pliny (N.H.
xviii. 8) distinguishes ‘ siligo’ from wheat
(triticum) and barley (hordeum). It was
a fine grain ; 31111 the bread made from it

respect for the bread-pan must be main-
tained? The reading ‘ artoptae’ is that of
the Scholiast, who explains it as “ pistoris,
vel vasis in quo panis coquitur.'’ The de-
rivation would suit either meaning, but the
word is used for a baking-pan by Plautus:
