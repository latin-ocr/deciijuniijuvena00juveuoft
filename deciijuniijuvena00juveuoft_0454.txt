A. PERSII FLACCI

In locuplete penu defensis pinguibus Umbris,

Et piper ct pernae, Marsi monumenta clientis3

75

Maenaque quod prima nondum defecerit orca.
Hic aliquis de gente hircosa centurionum

Dicat : “ Quod sapio satis est mihi 3 non ego curo

Esse quod Arcesilas aerumnosique Solones,

Obstipo capite et figentes lumine terram

80

Murmura cum secum et rabiosa silentia rodunt,
Atque exporrecto trutinantur verba labello,
Aegi-oti veteris meditantes somnia, gigni
De nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reverti.
Hoc est quod palles? cur quis non prandeat hoc est ?’' 85
Η15 populus ridet, multumque torosa juventus
Ingeminat tremulos naso crispante cachinnos.
‘⁶ Inspice, nescio quid trepidat mihi pectus, et aegris

Pelamydum, aut veteres Afrorum epi-
menia bulbi,

Aut vinum Tiberi devectum, quinque la-
genae,

Si quater egisti.''

Thus he speaks of ‘siccus petasunculus,'
and here Persius speaks of ‘ perna? They
are both parts of a pig, but it is not certain
what part each name signifies. ‘Petaso'
is generally called a flitch, which takes in
the shoulder and ribs 3 ‘perna' is usually
supposed to be a ham. The ‘ maena’ was
a small sea-fish of some sort ς and he says
that they came in so fast that the first jar
was not empty before others came to be
added to it.

77. Hie aliquis de gente hircosa] Some
military blockhead expresses his contempt
for this sort of knowledge, and says what
he knows is enough for him. We have had
a sketch of these captains in the sixteenth
Satire of Juvenal, and ‘ hircosa’ corre-
sponds to that in S. xiv. 194:

“ Sed caput intactum buxo naresque pi-
Aiiiiiiitset et grandes miretur Laelius
a as.’'

Below Persius calls them ‘varicosos Cen-
‘nu-iones? (S. v. 189.) Horace has “ magni
Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti '' (S.
i. 6. 73), whose fathers were content to send
them to the country school to learn arith-
metic.

7 9. Esse qnod Arcesilas] He couples
the names of two very different men, who
lived more than three centuries apart.

Arcesilaus, or, as he was sometimes called,
Arcesilas, was the disciple and successor
of Crantor as the head of the Academy,
in which 118 made such changes, chiefly
with the view of bringing back the views
of the founder, as to be called the founder
of the New Academy. He lived about
200 B.C. ⁴ Obstipo' means stiff and bent
downwards. It is explained on Hor. S.
ii. 5. 92: “Davus sis comicus atque Stes
capite obstipo multum similis metuenti.’'
This man speaks of the philosophers as
chewing their muttered words and their
mad silence, a description which may be
understood. There is no nearer likeness
of a madman than a person muttering to
himself and carrying on a conversation
with his own thoughts, when he gets
excited and is not aware that he is seen.
The man is here represented as thrusting
out his lips as if 118 were weighing his
words upon them, thinking over the
dreams of some old dotard3 and then we
have the Epicurean maxim (Lucretius i.
150), “ Nullam rem e nilo gigni divinitus
unquam.'’ M. Antoninus (iv. 4) has, 111

a different connexion, οὐδὲν ἐκ τοῦ μη· ’

δενὸς ἔρχεται ὥσπερ μηδ’ εἷς τὸ οὐκ ὒν
ἀπέρχεται. ‘Aegri somnia’ is a proverbial
expression, as in Horace, A. P. 7, “ velut
aegri somnia.” As to ‘aegroti veteris'
see note on Juv. ix. 16, “Quid macies
aegri veteris.” As to ‘ cur quis non pran-
deat’ compare Horace (S. ii. 3. 257),
“ Postquam est impransi correptus voce
magistri.'’ ⁸ Naso crispante‚' ‘with curling

θ
11058,’ 15 like ‘naso suspendis aduuco‚’ 2

‘ uncis naribus,' and the like (S. i. 40, n.).
