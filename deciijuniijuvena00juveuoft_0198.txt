D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Verberat atque obiter faciem linit, audit amicas,
Aut latum pictae vestis considerat aurum,
Et caedit ; long-i relegit transversa diurni,
Et caedit donec lassis caedentibus “ Exi 1³²

Intonet horrendum jam cognitione peracta.

485

Praefectura domus Sicula non mitior aula.
Nam si constituit solitoque decentius optat
Ornari et properat jamque exspectatur in hortis
Aut apud Isiacae potius sacraria lenae,

Disponit crinem, laceratis ipsa capillis,

He breaks the sticks, in 0110 501150, 011
whose back they are broken. The ‘ferula '
was usually a vine-switch. The ‘flagellum'
was made with various eruel devices, and
was sometimes fatal. See Horace, S. i.
2. 41, “ille flagellis Ad mortem caesus;''
and note on S. i. 3. 119, “Ne scutica dig-
num horribili sectere flagello;'' and Smith's
Dict. Ant„ Art. ‘ Flagrum.’ In the slave
family there were ‘lorarii' kept for flog-
ging their fellows. Some women, he says,
paid a sal-ary (annua) to the public tor-
turers, who tortured slaves for evidence.
As to the construction with ‘sunt qui‚' see
note on Hor. C. i. 1. 3.

481. Verberat atque obiter] While the
flogging is going 011, she coolly employs
herself with her face-wash‚ talks to her
friends, admires the gold border on her
dress, and reads her accounts. ‘Trans-
versa diurni' the Scholiast explains as
“ratiocinium diurnum 111 transversa charta
seriptum ;” that is, the accounts were so
long that they were written across as well
as down the page. Others take ‘trans-
versa' to be the same as ‘adversm-ia?
which are notes, so called because they were
jotted down on each side of the paper
(i. 6, 11.). Some MSS. of inferior note
have ι1101150011ιᾷ which would stand for
the ordinary word ‘acta.' But this is a
substitute for ‘ transversa,' by some copy-
ist, who thought the public newspaper (acta
diurna) was meant. [Ribbeck has ‘trans-
acta.'] The Scholiast is probably right.
Forcellini does not take notice of this
passage.

485. jam coynh‘ioneperacta] He speaks
of it as a judicial proceeding‚ a ‘ cognitio?
The barbarities here spoken of are pro-
bably no exaggeration. Where caprice had
110 legal limits, it would often run wild.

486. Praefectura domus] “ The govern-
ment of a private house is not less eruel
than that of Sicilian tyrants in their
palace.” The names of Phalaris of Agri-

490

gentum and Dionysius of Syracuse are
still proverbial for cruelty. “ Invidia
Siculi 11011 invenere tyranni Majus tor-
mentum '³ (Hor. Epp. i. 2. 58). Μ. and
many MSS. and old editions have ‘Pro-
fectura domo,' which involves a false quan-
tity and no sense.

487. Nam si constituit] “If she has
made an assignation.'’ (See S. iii. 12,
“Numa constituebat amicae.'') Ruperti
says this is not the meaning, but that it is
‘ constituit ornari,' ‘has resolved to dress
herself‚' which is certainly wrong. Gran-
gaeus and Heinrich take it the other way.
As to ‘ nan1,’ see above, v. 185, n.

488. in hortis Aut apud Isiacae] The
Scholiast says, “quia in hortis templorum
adulteria committuntur.'' Grangaeusthinks
the affair of Silius and Messalina 111 the
garden of Lucullus is referred to (Tac.
Ann. xi. 32). But these places were pro-
bably much frequented for such purposeS,
as the Scholiast says. We have below (ix.
24), “ quo non prostat foemina templo?‘’
Most temples had colonnades, and some
had gardens, attached to them. The wor-
ship of Isis was the most impure of all.
It was introduced from Egypt into Greeee
in early times: it is said to have been
brought to Rome in the dictatorship of
Sulla. It was repeatedly suppressed, and
her temples and chapels destroyed 3 but it
was too popular to be put down, and in
the reign of Vespasian it was 1111111)γ es-
tablished (S. ix. 22). The commentators
quote from Josephus (Aut. xviii. 3. 4) a
story of one Mundus, who in the time of
Tiberius decoyed a Roman matron into
the temple of Isis and there violated her
under the character of Anubis, with the
connivance of the priests, who were eru-
cified by the emperor's orders. Juvenal
calls the goddess herself a procuress‚ not
her priestess, as Ruperti says.

490. Disponit crinem] The slaves who
discharged this duty, and others connected
