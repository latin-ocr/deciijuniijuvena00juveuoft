414 A. PERSII FLACCI

ness is frequent in Horace, whose language Persius copies in this Satire more even than
in the others. Most of the places are pointed out in the notes.

This poem is ranked by the critics above the other five. There is not much obscurity
in it, though, according to the plan of this edition, it requires a good many notes. The
address to Cornutus has those evidences of genuine feeling which always attract admi-
ration. Had it been expresscd in language more original, it would have appeared still
more real. The astrological fictions (of course known by the writer to be so) do not
much detract from this reality, though they would hardly answer the same purpose now.
The description of a slave's manumission, and its consequences, is humorous and vigor·
ous. Cornutus, who had gone through the process himself, was probably amused when
he read it. The rest of the poem contains so much that is borrowed in form and lan-
guage, that, although the bon-owed material is well applied and forcibly used, it takes
a good deal from the credit of the poem, and makes it doubtful whether it will sustain
all the praises that have been bestowed upon it.

Various passages are quoted by Scholiasts and old writers, and particularly by John
of Salisbury, who, in his Policraticus sive De nugis Curialium et vestigiis Philo-
sophorum (Lugd. Bat. 1639), makes large use of quotat-ions from Juvenal and Persius.
His readings would be of much value, as belonging to the twelfth century, if it were
not that he sometimes quotes from memory, and changes the words to suit his purpose.

AR GUMENT.

Bards tragic and bards epic all are wont to pray the Muses for a hundred tongues.
‘What’s this? that strong meat are you going to give us now? Let the grand
poets go to Helicon and gather fogs. You're not the man to labour at the forge, and
mutter to yourself, and puff your cheeks. Yours is the common tongue, harmonious,
smooth, skilful in humorous satire. Confine yourself to this ; leave horrid banquets,
stick to vulgar dinners.'

V. 19. I've no desire to swell my page with tragic nonsense, giving weight to smoke.
We are alone, and here Ι offer you, Cornutus, my heart to search, that you may know
how much of me you are. Strike, you will find it solid. For this I ask a hundred
tongues, to tell my hidden love for you.

V. 30. 1Υ11011 first Ι went abroad a man, that time when friends are wont to flatter,
and ignorance to lead the feet astray, Ι gave myself to you. You took me to your
bosom: insensibly you trained my principles; my mind submitted gladly3 you
formed with artist's skiu the plastic features: with you 1 passed long days, and
stole the early hours from night. Our work and rest were one, and social meals
relaxed our serious toils. You cannot- doubt our days are joined in one sure bond ς
our star is one: our times were equal at our birth, our fates harmonicus 3 Jove
protects us both.

V. 50. Men and their wishes vary. One trades, another sleeps, one loves the Campus,
one the dice, another languishes in lust. But when the gout comes then they
mourn too late the life they’ve left behind them. 'Tis your delight to study and to
sow the seeds of truth in youthful ears. Here, young and old, get for your minds
a purpose, and provision for hoar hairs. ‘ To-morrow i'n shall be.' Aye, to-morrow
it will be the same. ‘that, grudge me but one day ?' But when another day
is come then yesterday is gone, and so ἰο-1110110117 drives away ‘to-day, and the

V. 73. We all want liberty, not that which gives the slave his name and his corn
ticket. Fools Ξ who suppose a single turn can make a citizen. This worthless Dama
gets a twist and straight is Marcus Dama ! Marcus is surety, who would refuse to
