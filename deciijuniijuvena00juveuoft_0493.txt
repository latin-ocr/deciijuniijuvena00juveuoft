But if the runners occupied their own
ground, and the rules of the racc required
that each should stay at his post, the one
who left it would lose his chance. “Our
critics would make a poor figure at New-
market‚'' says Gifford; but he is not
more successful himself, and says this
is almost the only line in Persius in which
he has found much real difficulty. ‘Qui
prior es' refers, as Casaubon, Plum, Koe-
nig, Heinrich say, to the superior claims
of the ‘legitimus heres' over Manius.
Gifford sees a pathetic allusion to the
poet’s delicate state of health, because he
died young. For ‘in decursu,' which
is the reading of nearly all the MSS„
and of all editions but his own, Heinrich
reads ‘ indecursum: ' but though ‘spatium
decursum’ is a proper expression (Cic. de
Senect. c. 23). ‘ cursor decursus ' is not.

62. Sum tibi Mercurium] He says he
is the man's Mercurius, who was repre-
sented in works of art as offer-ing different
persons a ‘ marsupium,' bag of money, as
stated on Horace, S. ii. 3. 68, “ Rejecta
praeda quam praesens Mercurius fert.'’
Probably Persius had this passage in
mind. He means the man would be a
fool to reject the purse because he did not
know how much it contained, or because
it did not contain as much as he wished,
and so he would be a fool to reject his
‘hereditas’ because part of the property
had been spent.

63. vis tu gaudere relictis ἲ]
MSS. have ‘vin' tu.' The rule now
generally accepted iu regard to ‘ vis ’ and
‘vin’‚’ is that which Gronovius has laid
down on Seneca de Ira, c. 28, that ¹ vis‚'
though interrogative, contains something
of command or exhortation, which ‘ vin' ³

Most

does not. See note on Juv. v. 711«. This
being the case, Ι do not see why the editors
have all adopted ‘ vin' ³ here, when there is
authority for ‘ vis.’

64. minui mihi:] ‘ If some part of the
whole is gone, I have cut-tailed it to my
own loss; but whatever it is (that is left),
to you it is entire? I do not agree with
Jahn, who puts ‘Deest aliquid summae'
into the mouth of the ¹ heres? Tadius is
any body. The MSS. vary between this
and Stadius or Staius (ii. 19). He tells
the man not to din into his cars the old
advice that fathers give their sons, that
he should put his money out to interest
and live upon the income. ‘Reponerc’
is ‘to repeat again and again.' ‘ Merces'
is used for interest of money by Horace,
S. i. 2. 14, “ Quinas hic capiti mercedes ;''
and 3. 88, “Mercedem aut nummos unde
unde extricat.’' Here the expression
‘ foenoris merces ' is more complete.

68. Quid reliquum est ἵ] The heres is
supposed to ask how much he has left
after all his waste? At which the poet
bursts out with an indignant answcr,
repeating the man’s word, and then
turning to his servant and telling him
to pour on the 011 more prodigally than
ever. ‘Urtica‚' ‘nettles,’ was food for
the poorcst (Hor. Epp. i. 12. 8), and a
dried pig’s head with split ears was nei-
ther savoury nor elegant. ‘Caules' are
the better sort of vegetables of the cab·
hage kind (brassica), brocoli, canHflowcr,
διο. ‘Iste’ is as if the man were before
him. As to goose's liver, sce Juv. v. 114,
where the master keeps that delicaey for
himself.

He asks if he is to reduce himself to a
