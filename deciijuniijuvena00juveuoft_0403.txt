SATIRA XV. 353

Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos,

De conducendo loquitur jam rhetore Thule.
Nobilis illc tamen populus quem diximus, et par
Virtute atque lide sed major clade Sag-nutus

Tale quid excusat.

largest of the Shetland lslauds. He says
they were talking of hiring a master of
rhetoric there. Mercatores had no doubt
found their way to Thule: but the Romans
never took possession of that island. There
isanother Thule, which is only known from
fabulous reports. But it was probably part
of the mainland of Europe, much to the
north of Britain.

113. Nobilis ille tamenpopulus] “How-
ever, though that noble pcople we have
spoken of (the Vascones) were no Stoics
and had none of our learning, they and the
Saguntines‚ their equals in courage and
fidelity and worse in their sufferings‚ had
excuse for any such conduct ’'—not ‘⁴ urges
some such plea as this (of necessity): so
‘ez-e. morbum‚’ &c.’' (Mayor.) There is
nothing said about necessity, and the na-
ture of the excuse is left to be inferred.

Saguntus is a form of Ζάκυνθος, from
which island (Zante) the colony originally
eame. The form Saguntus is not so com-
mon as Saguntum. It was a town on the
east coast of Hispania, a mile from the sea.
It was in close alliance with the Romans at
the time when Hannibal was appointed to
command the armies of Carthage in His-
pania, and he made it one of his first ob-
Jects to pick a quarrel with the Saguntinos
and lay siege to the town, which he took
aster a siege of eight months 13.c. 219.
When the inhabitants were reduced to the
last extremity and hard ter-ms of peace were

fbrought them, some of the leading men
without any warning to the others 10st the
senate-house, got together all the silver and
gold they could collect, and made a tire in

1110 markct-place into which they threw the
treasurcs and themselves. thcn Hannibal
entered the town he ordered all the males
of full age to 110 put to death (Livy xxi.
14). Florus tells 1110 story ofthc 111-1· with
additions (ii. 6. ss): ‘⁸ immanem in foro cx-
citant rogum: tum desuper se suosque
cum omnibus opibus suis ferro et igni cor-
1·umpunt;” and Valerius Maximus (vi. 6.
1) says the same: “collatis in forum quae
unicuique erant carissima,'' &a All the
writers attribute their gallant conduct 10
their tidelity to Rome, and Valerius is
eloquent on this point: “ Crediderim tunc
ipsam Fidem humana negotia speculantem
moestum gessisse vultum, perseverantissi-
mum sui cultum, iniquae fortunaejudiciO,
tam acerbo exitu damnatum cernentem?
Augustin has a chapter on the Saguntines
(de Civ. Dei iii. 20) in which he highly
praises their fidelity and wishes it had
been iu a better cause that they might
have won eternal life. He says what
Juvenal appears to have believed, “ etiam
suorum cadaveribus a nonnullis pasta per-
hibetur.'' Silius has a great many rather
tiresome verses at the end of his second
book about the fall and faithfuluess of
Saguntum, which some may think poetical.
In Freinshem's note on Florus», ii. 18,
15 (Duker's edition, Leyden, 1744), is a.
catalogue of towns which defended them·
selves as 011511011101)1 as these that Juvenal
mentions. They are twenty-five in num-
ber, and their collective history would
give such a picture of war as might make
its advocates think differently. ‘Sagun-
tina fames ' came to be a proverb among
the Romans as λιμὸς Μήλιος among the
Greeks from the siege of Melos by the
Athenians. See Thucyd. v. 1145 Aris-
toph. Av. 186; and Erasmus, Adag. p.
564, fol. ed.

115. Maeotide saevior ara] The legend
respecting the Tauri who sacrificcd to their
goddess all strangers that came to their
country is most popularly known through
Euripides' play, Iphigenia in Tauris, which
turns upon the recognition of Iphis-r« nia
and her brother Orestes, she being the
priestess of the goddess and he 11 straus-cr
brought to 110 sacrificed. The Tauri in·
