“ Jam fas 0st; admitte viros.” Jam dormit adulter ;

Illa jubet sumpto juvenem properare cucullo.
Si nihil est servis incurritur.
Servorum, venit et eomluetus aquarius.

Majorem quam sunt duo Caesaris Anticatones

Quaecunque alterius sexus imitata figuram est.

“ Pone seram, cohibe.’'

Sed quis custodiet ipsos

Custodes? Cauta est et ab illis incipit uxor.
Jamque eadem summis pariter minimisque libido :

337. Noverunt Mauri atque Indi,] ‘All
the world knows.’ The ‘psaltria’ referred
to is Clodius, Cicero's profligate adversary,
who in A.U.c. 692 got himself introduced,
dressed as a female musieian, into a room
in Caesar’s house, where the myster-ies of
Bona Dea were being celebrated. His ob-
ject was to keep an assignation with Pom-
peia, Caesar’s wife. The two verses before
this (335, sq.) Heinrich considers spurious
[and they are omitted by Ribbeck]

338. duo Caesaris Anticatones] Cicero
wrote a book in praise of Cato of Utica, to
which Caesar replied in a work in two
books, called Anticato. Suetonius men-
tions it (caes. c. 56), and Gellius quotes
from it (iv. e. 16). Cicero also refers to
the work oceasionally. It seems to have
been very abusive. (“ Ejus vituperationis
quam Caesar scripsit de Catone,” Cic. ad
Att. xii. 41.)

342. Et quie tunc hominum] ‘ Tunc' is
ἱὲῗιῖῗξζῖζ ἳῖὲᾶ εέἔζίῗἛωίἓ 12¹⁰.. 0333152'232-
every altar. ‘Simpuvium' wns a sort of
earthen cup out of which libations were

poured. Another form of the word is
‘ simpulum) ‘ Nigrum catinum' means a
‘ coarse dish of elay‚' of which also the
paterae were made. They are all meant
to represent the simplicity of the ancient
worship. ‘Vaticano monte’ is only a way
of speaking. The clay that made the cup
was got he means in· the neighbourhood,
and a rude native artist made it.

346. olim moneatis amic-22] ‘Olim’ means
that long since his old experieneed friends
had been inclined to advise this course.
All the time he has been going on exposing
the women, they had been saying, ‘⁴ thy
don’t you put loeks upon them, and keep
them under restraint ?’' This seems to be
the meaning. (See S. iv. 96.) [Ρ. aud Rib-
beck have ‘ prohibe' in place of ‘ cohibe.']
The next words, “ Sed quis custodiet ipsos
Custodes,” have a proverbial air. They at
least are so used now, and express a great
deal.
