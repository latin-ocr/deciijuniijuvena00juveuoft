xxxiv . INTRODUCTION.

temporarios, the personages on whom he pours out his indignation are
those with whom he and his contemporaries were well acquainted, and
they are those of whom mention is made by Tacitus, Suetonius, the
younger Pliny, and Martial. In the spurious Satires, on the contrary,
which are 1110 work of a Declamator, as Ribbeck calls him, the few
names which may belong to contemporaries of Juvenal are with some
exceptions totally unknown. These Satires also give 115 little informa-
tion 011 'manners or events 111 Rome, while nearly every line of the
genuine Satires contains instructive matter. The Declamator abounds
in 31111510115 to Greek and Roman history and to mythical legends.
Even Moses is introduced to 115. It is true that the writer of the
genuine Satires shows that he was well acquainted with Greek and
Roman history3 but he handles his matter like a man of sense, who
knows the world, while the Declamator writes like a pedant.

The Declamator, who tells us little about Rome, treats 115 with a great
deal about foreign parts, and in the fifteenth Satire he even takes 115
11110 Egypt3 and yet, as Ribbeck maintains, he does not even know that
Canopus (xv. 44, and the note) is in Egypt.

It has been observed also, 110 adds, that the Declamator has a turn for
philosophy, but the genuine Juvenal scarcely indicates any 13510 for such
speculation. He never uses the word Sapientia, which the Declamator
prizes highly, and, following the Stoic doctrine, declares that Nature and
Philosophy teach the same thing (xiii. 189). He seems also to have
collected some of his philosophical matter from other writers; for
instance, Sat. X. 28, &c., greatly resembles a passage in Seneca De
Tranquillitate Animi, c. 15, ‘ Democritum potius ;’ and the matter of a
passage in Sat. x, 346 may have been derived from Valerius Maximus,
vii. 2, Ext. 1 (see the note on that passage).

From this brief statement the reader may collect the nature of the
general objections to the genuineness of the five Satires which Ribbeck
attributes to an unknown Declamator. He supports his general con-
clusion by an examination of many passages, and he employs a chapter
of three—and-seventy well filled pages in belabouring the unfortunate
Declamator, to whom, as far as 1 11310 observed, he allows no merit at
all, not even to the few lines which may be admired by those who do
not value all the Declamator's 'poetry. Those who will take the pains
to read Ribbeck’s satirica] remarks on the false Satirist, will be amused
and instructed, if they shall not be convinced. In fact he has under—
taken to prove what is osten difficult to prove, and sometimes impossible ;
to show froin a comparison of writingS, attributed to the same person,
that some are genuine and some are not. But he evidently has confi-
dence 1111115 own conclusion, and he presses it so hard that he sometimes
misunderstands or affects not to understand that which others may find
