Quo loquor egregium populus puta-t acquirendi

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

115

Artificem z quippe his crescunt patrimonia fabris ε
Sed crescunt quocunque modo, majoraque fiunt
Incude assidua semperque ardente camino.

Et pater crgo animi felices credit avaros,

Qui miratur opes, qui nulla exempla beati

120

Pauperis esse putat ; juvenes hortatur ut illam

Ire viam pergant et eidem incumbere sectae.

Sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa 3 his protinus illos
Imbuit et cogit minimas ediscere sordes;

Mox acquirendi docet insatiabile votum.

his son, as an instance of the benefits of
thriftiness.

115. putat acquirendi] ‘Atque veren-
dum’ is the reading of some MSS., of
Britannicus and some of the other old
editions, and Achaintre who defends it.
The reading probably arose out of another
‘atque verendi? which is in some MSS.
of repnte, and this seems to be a corruption
of the true reading 111 the text, which the
modern editors, except Achaintre‚ have all
adopted. ‘Artificem' requires a genitive.
It treats the man as a workman diligent
in his calling, which is to make money,
which he gets any way he can (“re1n facias,
rem, Si possis recte, si non quocunque
modo re1n,” Hor. Epp. i. 1. 65), plying
the anvil and working the forge from
morning till night.

119. Et pater eryQ] “The father too,
as Ι said,” another instance of ‘ergo' in
this sense (see x. 54, n.). 1 do not take it
(like Mr. Mayor) to mean because the
people admire therefore the father does.
The young are taken in by the reputation
the miser geta and also they are influenced
by their fathers' example and precept.
P. has the true reading ‘felices ι’ most
MSS. have ‘felicis,' to which, though he
does not adopt it, Ruperti affixes his absurd
“ non male !”

120. Qui miratur opes,] Most MSS.
have the plural for the singular inthis and
the two next verbs. P. has the singular.
All the Paris MSS. being in favour of the
plural, Achaintre has adopted that number
and put a full stop at ‘avaros’ In this
way ‘ qui mirantur ³ and ‘ qui putant ² are
the subject of ‘hortantur.' This makes
the three last lines a feeble piece of bathos
as ever was written. Madvig (Opp. ii. p.
202) would have the plural 111 ‘ mirantur'

and ‘putant,' but the singular in ‘hortatur‚’
by which ‘qui mirantur—putant’ is no
more than a description and a weak 0118 of
‘ avaros! He is not speaking of all fathers,
for some are extravagant, but of the money-
loving father. And so he says the father
thinks the covetous happy, that is, he who
admires wealth and thinks there never was
an instance ofa man who was at once poor
and favoured by heaven3 such a man ad-
vises his sons to go that road and adhere
to that sect (as if they were the only phi-
losophers). ‘ Felices ¹ are happy men ;
‘beati ³ arc those who prosper or are fa-
voured by the gods. ‘Pauper' is not used
for an indigent person, but one of small
means, and such may prosper 3 but this
father thinks not, because the more a man
has the more 118 gets. As to ‘pauper’
see Horace, C. i. 1. 18, 11.; S. ii. 2. 45.

122. Ire viam pergant] P. has ‘per-
agant.’ Jahn and Hermann however have
the right word.

123. Sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa‚-]
He says all vices have their elements as
every science has, and in teaching their
children this vice of covetousness fathers
begin with petty acts of meanneSS, and
aftclerwards teach it them 011 the largest
sca e.

126. Servorum ventres] He here gives
a description of avarice, such as these fa-
thers would furnish examples of, and the
form of the satire changes. He is speaking
of the domestic arrangements of the miser,
in which he punishes himself not less than
his wretched slaires. He serves out their
allowance of corn in a false measure, while
118 starves himself. Theophrastus says of
such a man that he kuocks in the bottom
of the measure and carefully wipes off all
that overtops it (Charact. xi.), where
