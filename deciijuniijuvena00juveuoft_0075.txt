tuted, in two of the old editions (NHrnberg,
1497, and Ascensius of Paris, 1198), ( pu-
teum: probably through inadvertence. But
the word 11115 been taken up by eonnnenta·
tors (Valesius, Graevius, Heiiisius.are men-

tioned by Ruperti) and a new sense giren
to the passage. Cleanthes· is reported to
have earued the means ot' living hy drawino·

water ς aud he is said to have been called
in consequence φρεσίντλης. Wherefore
these critics have supposed Juvenal to have
meant that these 111011 set up images of
Cleanthes to guard their wells, ‘ puteum
servare. ’ More consideration has been
given to this suggestion th· 111 it deserv es.

‘Archetypos' is usually 1¹·eude1ed‘ original)

‘rb’ αρχέτυπον, τὸ πρωτότυπον signify the
model or pattern from which copies are
taken. ‘Archetypum' 1135 the 531110· but
the word 15 not found as early as Augustus.
⁸ I'rototypia' occurs in the Codex Theo-
dos. (see Foreell.), 111 the same sense. The
adjective ‘ archetypus ¹ 15 found only here
and in Martial vii. 11, where he says to his
friend, Aulus Pudens, who had asked him
for a copy of his poems corrected with his
own hand: “ O quam ine nimium probas
amasque Qui vis archetypas hahere nugas. “³”
See also xii. 69. “Sic tanqu un tabulas
scy phosque‚ Paulle, Omnes archetypos habes
amicos!

8. Frontis mdlafides] Some of the
oldest editions and four of the MSS. quoted
by Achaintre, have ‘ fronti‚’ which Ruperti
adopts. Most of the editions, and all the
other MSS. appear to have the genitive.
The difference is not important. ‘Fronti
nulla tides ’ would mean ‘ there is no trust
to be put in the outside ;’ ‘frontis‚' that
the outside has nothing trustworthy in it;
in the one case ‘fides ’ is (11111113 111 the
other that on which saith is exereised. The
expression of the brow represents as much
as any part of the face the working of the
mind, and ‘ frons' appears with every epi-
thet that expresses character and feeling.
But the sace may be tutored and expression
assumed, and the lewdest villain may wear
the most modest brow. μὴ κρίνετε κατ’
ὄψιν, ἀλλὰ τὴν δικαίαν κρίσιν κρίνατε,
ie the divine command.

9. Tristibus obscoenis ?] ‘ Tristihus’ is
here ‘ grave‚' ‘ serious! Horace opposes it
to ‘j<wosus,' S. i. 10. 111 “ Et sermone
opus est inodo tristi saepe ιῙοο050.” The
two adjectives ·11·0 not commonly joined
tog e·.thtr ((5)1)(0111115 signitiesthat which
15 connuon or uncle an. lt is said to con·
111111 the (“ ret-k κοινὸς, which is doubtful.
It 15 applied to things, persons, words, dcc„
ofill omen; but also as here, aud as we
use it, to the lewd.—‘ quum sis ε’ ‘although
¹von are.' Quintilian (lust. xii. 3. 1111.)
throws light upon the subject of this Satire,
when(writing inDomitian‘s time) he speaks
of men “ pigritiae arrogantioris, qui subito
fronte conficta immissaque barba veluti de-
spexissent oratoria praecepta‚paulum aliquid
sederunt in scholis philosophorum, ut deinde,
in publico tristes, domi dissoluti, captarent
auctoritatem contemtu ceterorum. Philoso-
phia enim (he adds) simulari potest, elo-
quentia non potest.'’

10. InlerSocralic-os] The commentators
and translators, old and modern, are divi-
ded as to the meaning of ‘ Socraticos?
The sense is the sanie as in ‘fictos Scau-
ros’ (v. 34, 11.); these 111011 carried on their
vile practices under the disguise of mo-
ralists. The Socratics they would affect to
imitate were Antisthenes and the C) 11105.
They are called Stoics below, v. 65 (500
Int.). Others, like the Scholiast, suppose
that J 11101131 adopted the libel against So-
crates, which made him as bad 111 that re-
spectasthey. Of Socratespersonally Juvenal
speaks with respect (xiii. 185, sq. ). ‘Sota-
dicos' has been suggested as an emendation,
del ived from one Sot· ·1(105, who, according to
Athenaeus and others, 1135 the first 11110
praetised this abomination. But no MSS.
support the 11 ord; nor 113νο any editors, I
believe, adopted it, though it 1135 always
been thought necessary to notice it.

12. atrocem animum. .·] ‘A bold, manly
mind) ‘Atrox' 0011111101111 has the meaning
of a dogged courage‚ as in Horace, C. ii.

“ Et cuncta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis,'’
