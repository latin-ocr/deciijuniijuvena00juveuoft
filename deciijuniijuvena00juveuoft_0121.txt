guests, and he puts them off with a mess of
ineat. ‘ Culina ’ was a portable kitehen in
which the provisions were carried to keep
them warm. Seneca (Epp. 78, sub fin.)
speaks of this sort of thing as lately in-
vented: “O infelicem aegrum 1³³ he ex-
claimS, “ Quare? quia non cirea coenatio-
nem ejus tumultus eoquorum 651 ipsos cum
obsoniis focos transferentium ; hoe eniinjam
luxuria commenta est: ne quis intepescat
cibus, ne quid palato jam calloso parum fer-
veat, coenam culina prosequitur.”

251. Corbulo vix ferret] This may be
any strong man. 'l'he Scholiast says he
was an athlete, or 6156 11 was a sort of ship,
which is mere guess-work. The Roman
general Corbulo (ii. 164 note) is described
by Tacitus as of large stature (Anu. xiii.
8), and his name may have passed into
a proverb in this matter ς but it 15 impos·
sible to say.

254. Longa coruscat Sarraco] ‘ Sarra-
cum ’ was a waggon, and is applied below
to the constellation of the Great Bear,
which we call Charles' lVain (v. 23).

257. qui saxa Liyustica portat] Stone
from the qual-ries of Liguria, that is, from
the Maritime Alps, which bounded that
country on the west, or the Apennines,
which ran through it on the south. The
Carrara marble was formerly called Lu-
nense, from Luna, which was a town near
the present quarries. These arc on the
borders of the ancient ‘Ligurian in the
north of Etruria ς and a large part of the

publiO buildings were made of this stone
in the time of Augustus. ‘Procubuit’ and
‘fudit ' are used like the Greek aorist.

261. IlIore animae] ‘Like a breath’
He goes on to suppose one of these men
hurrying home to his diuner, with his slave
carrying a ‘ sportula’ behind him, when a
great stoue falls on 111111 and a number
of others, and crushes them all to death.
All this time his servants at home, ex-
peeting his return, are washing the dishes,
blowing up the fire, getting ready the ‘stri-
giles‚’ towels, and oil, for his bath ; while
he is shivering on the banks of the Styx,
without a farthing to pay Charon to carry
him across. ‘Domus' is the ‘familia do-
mestica? ‘ Foculus’ was a small xnovable
brazier, as ‘focus' or ‘caminus ' was a
flxture of stone or brick. ,‘ Strigil ' was a
seraper used after bathing: they were oiled
to prevent their hurting the skin. ‘Sonat'
means elatters or rings, for these things
were commonly of metal.· ‘ Guttus' was a
bottle with a long thiu neck, commonly
used for oil. (See Hor. S. i. 6. 118, 11.) ‘ Pue-
ros' are the sanie as ‘ domus?

265. tetrumque novicius horret] ‘No-
vieius,' ‘ novice,' was usually applied to
new slaves not accustomed to their work.
Here only it means a new comer. ‘Al-
