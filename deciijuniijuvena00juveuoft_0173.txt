Et cellam vacuam atque suam. Tunc nuda papillis
Constitit auratis titulum mentita Lyciscae,
Ostenditque tuum, generose Britannice, ventrem.

Excepit blanda intrantes atque aera poposcit,

Et resupina jacens multorum absorbuit ictus.
Mox lenone suas jam dimittente puellas

Tristis abit, et quod potuit tamen ultima cellam
Clausit adhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae,

Et lassata viris nec dum satiata recessit,

Obscurisque genis turpis fumoque lucernae
Foeda lupanaris tulit ad pulvinar odorem.
Hippomanes carmenque loquar coetumque venenum

⁴ Cento' is a coverlid or other piece of patch-
work ς and Heinrich supposes it here means
a eloth hung up before the doors, keeping
the -αἰι- out of the cells and the reeking
moisture in. The Scholiast says on ‘ een-
tenes “ut velo ex pannis facto.'' These
places were named after their inmates, who
were called ‘lupae ' for their rapacity.
(“Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse
rapaci,'’ Hor. Epp. i. 14. 33.) Gifford says,
“ The stews at Rome were constructed in
the form of a gallery, along which were
ranged on each side a number of contiguous
cells or little chambers. Over the door of
each of these was written the name, and in
some cases the price of the tenants, who
stood at the entrance soliciting the pre-
ference of the visitors.'' Therefore Ovid
says, ‘⁸ Stat meretrix certo cuivis mercabilis
aere ’' (Am. i. 10. 21). And Martial has
(xi. 45) “ Intrasti quoties inscriptae limina
cellae.” Messalina had frequented one
chamber so often that it was called hers,
and kept vacant for her. She exposed her
person, as seems to have been usual, and
called herself Lycisca, a common name for
such people, corresponding to their generic
name ‘ lupa.'

122. papillis Constitit auratis]
Ruperti and Heinrich explain, after Botti-
ger, of the gold ornaments on her neck.
But ‘ auratis ' means ‘ gilded: as in v. 48,
‘auratam juvencam ' is ‘a calf with gilded
horns,’ and ‘ papillae ’ does not mean the
neck. The passage quoted by Heinrich from
Ovid (Fast. ii. 310), “ aurato conspicienda
sinu'’ means that the dress was einbroidcred
with gold. Gifl'ord has rightly explained the
words. “The nipples were covered with
gold—leaf, a species of ornament which, how-
ever repugnant to our ideas of beauty, is
used by many of the dancing-girls and pri-

vileged courtezans of the East to this day.
A figure so ornamented is in the curious
cabinet of R. P. Knight, Esq.'’ P. has
‘ prostitit,' and so has the Scholiast. Jahn
[and Ribbeck] have adopted it. Most of
the MSS. have ‘constitit ;' and it is more
likely that the other should have got in as
a gloss than that ‘ constitit ’ should have
been invented. Heinrich says it is
stronger.

124. tuum, yenerose Britannice‚] Bri-
tannicus, the son of Claudius and Messa-
lina, was only six years old when his mother
was put to death, Λα). 48. His father
married Agrippina, mother of Nero, soon
after that event, and through her influence
set aside his son and adopted Nero as his
heir. Claudius was poisoned, and Nero suc·
ceeded, A.D. 54; and next year Britannicus
was poisoned by Nero, in his fourteenth
year. (Tae. Ann. xiii. 15.) He was ‘gene-
rosus ' in respect of his birth.

126. Et resupina] This verse is want-
ing in P„ M„ and most MSS„ having pro-
bably been omitted through the modesty of
the inonks. [Ribbeck also has omitted
vv. 125, 126]

130. [Ribbeck omits this verse]

131. Obscurisquenqenis] That is, dirty.
He says below (v. 145), “fiant obscuri den-
tes,” ‘⁴ let her teeth become black.”

132. ad pulvinar] “Ad lectum mari-
talem '’ is the Scholiast’s note.

133. Hippomanes carmenque]
are love potions audcharius, Hc asks if
he shall go on to speak of the other crimes
of women, such as the administering of love
philtres and chamus, and poisoning step-
children, for bad as their lust is, women
are driven to still greater crimes through
the dominion of their sex, that is, of the pas-
sions that belong to their sex. As to ‘hip-
