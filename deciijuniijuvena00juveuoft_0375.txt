Quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere verpos

Sed pater in causa, cui septima quaeque fuit lux

Ignava et partem vitae non attigit ullam.
Sponte tamen juvenes imitantur cetera, solam

Inviti quoque avaritiam exercere jubentur.

Fallit enim vitium specie virtutis et umbra,

the same hand evidently. The writer of
the last was not a Christian, as Cramer
observoe. He might have added that‘ the
other was a Christian, but not a judicious
one. ‘ Verpus’ is ‘ circumcised.’ Murtial
uses it several times. The Romans might
be forgiven for this interpretation of the
law of Moses when the J ews' own traditions
and teachers told them they must love
their neighbour and hate their enemy ς
and Jew and Samaritan thought it strange
that our Saviour asked for water from a
Samaritan woman and talked with her.
A Christian bishop too (Jeremy Taylor,
Duct. Dub. ii. 2. 4), says¹ “He Jews
might hate their enemim, but Christians
have none. So that by alteration of the
subject matter the old law is become new ;
that is we have a new law.'' This is not
true. “If thine enemy be hungry give
him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty give
him water to drink'’ is Solomon's inter-
pretation of the law, and the parable of the
Samaritan succouring a J ew was in-
vented to illustrate the fundamental rule,
“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy-
selffl’ Gifford has a good note on this
sub'ect.
1³07. Sponte twntenjuvenes] But though
young men are only too prone to imitate,
yet there is one vice of which this cannot
be said; to avarice they are not only not
prone but even averse (‘inviti quoque').
This is true generally but not universally.
Horace (S. ii. 3. 168, sqq.) tells a story of
one Servius Oppidius of Canusium who
had two sons, one of whom carried about
his nuts and his dice in a careless way,
and gave them away to any one who came,
while the other counted his and hid them,
always wearing a serious face. This led
him to think the one had a natural ten-
dency to extravagance and the other to

Adde quod hunc de

saving; and those who have watched the
different characters of children know that
there are some in whom this selfish pro-
pensity exists by nature, and has to be
checked by generous teaching. Juvenal
says that young men are cheated into co-
vetousness by its respectable appearance.
There is a gravity and show of sels-denial
about it. So Oppidius describes his covet·
ous son, ‘⁸ vidi Te, Tiberi, numerare, cavis
abscondere tristem.'’ ‘Fallit enim ' is
eniptical, they are bid and they do as they
are bid, for they are deceived by the ap-
pearance of virtue, though it is but the
shadow, which this vice wears. ‘ Habitu '
is the general appearance, and applies
equally to ‘ vultu' and ¹ veste? See S. ix.
20: “ sumit utrumque Inde habitum
facies-'³ ‘ Frugi ' is always used in a good
sense for ‘ prudent.' See Horace, S. ii. 5.
77, n. ‘Tutela ’ is used for ‘tutor ’ by a
common figure of speech. Horace has
“rerum) tutela mearum Cum sis '² (Epp.
i. 1. 103 .

111. laudatur] [‘ laudetur' Ρ., Jahn,
Ribbeck. If ‘ laudetur ' is preferred, there
must be a comma after ‘severum‚’ and ‘nec
dubie‚' διο. is a continuation of the sen-
tence.]

114. Hesperidum serpens aut Ponticum]
The Hesperides watched the apples and the
serpent Ladon watched the Hesperides, on
J uvenal’s principle ε “ Quis custodiet ipsos
Custodes ? '' Hercules killed him. The
golden fleece of Colchis in Pontus was also
guarded by a serpent, but Medea put him
to sleep aud Jason got the fleece. The
miser watching his treasures is said to
watch better than this. As to the Hespe-
rides see above S. v. 152, n.
