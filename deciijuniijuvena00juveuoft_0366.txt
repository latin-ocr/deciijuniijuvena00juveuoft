PLURIMA sunt, Fuscine, et fama digna sinistra

Et nitidis maculam haesuram figentia rebus,

Quae monstrant ipsi pueris traduntque parentes.

Si damnosa senem juvat alea, ludit et heres

Bullatus parvoque eadem movet arma fritillo. 5
Nec melius de se cuiquam sperare propinquo

Concedet juvenis, qui radere tubera terrae,

Boletum condire et eodem jure natantes

Mergere ficedulas didicit nebulone parente

2. maculam haesuram] This appears to
be the true reading, but it is preserved only
in P. The other MSS. have ‘ac rugam’ or
‘ et rugam‚' which reading Heinrich con—
jectures with great probability the monks
introduced from the Vulgate, where St.
Paul says (Eph. v. 27), “ut exhiberet ipse
sibi gloriosam ecclesiam non habentem ma-
culam aut rugam aut aliquid hujusmodi,
sed ut sit sancta et immaculata.’' Forcel-
lini, whose lexicon is of less service for
Juvenal than for other authors, quotes aud
explains this place thus: “nitidis rebus
maculam ct rugam figere: h. e. res bonas
corrumpere, ut rugae in vultu pulcritu-
dinem oris corrumpunt.'' A similar per-
version, noticed by Bentley, is found in
Hor. C. iii. 18. 12, where “ Festus in prato
vacat otiosus cum bove pagus '' is changed
into “cum bove pardus.'' The Seholiast
quotes Hor. C. iv. 4. 36 ι “ Utcunque defecere
mores Indecorant bene nata culpae.” J u-
venal says there are many habits which
deserve to be evil spoken of and which
fasten a stain upon fair things that will
never leave them. The fair things are the
unspoilt minds of children. These habits
corrupt their minds and get them bad re-
pnte. ‘Figere' and ‘haerere' both ex-
press the lasting mischief these practices
do. ⁶ Monstrant traduntque ' is, they not
only show these practices in their own con-
duct but teach them to their children.
‘ Tradere ' is a common word for teaching,
as above, S. vi. 239, and in Cicero, de
Divin. ii. 1 z “Nulla major occurrebat
quam si optimarum artium vias traderem
meis civibus.'’ As to ‘ alea' see S. xi. 176,
n., and i. 88, n. The kind of gaming here
alluded to is explained in the next verse,
where ‘ arma' means the ‘ tali’ or ‘ tesse-
rac,' and ‘ fritillus ’ was the box from
which they were thrown. Other names
for the box were ‘pyrgus ⁵ (πύργος) or
‘turricula' and ‘phimus ’ (φιμός). See
note on Hor. S. ii. 3. 171, “te talos, Aule,
nucesque,'' and 7. 17, “mitteret in phi-

mum talos.'' ‘ Heres' is equivalent to
‘filius,’ here and in S. xii. 95, since a
man’s children were all his ‘heredes’ if
they were in his power at his death (x.
237, n.). As to ‘ bullatus ' see S. v. 164.
7. qui radere tubera terma] See S. v.
116, n., “tradentur tubera ;'’ and v. 147,
n., ‘⁶ Boletus domino.'' ‘ Juveuis’ is op-
posed to ‘ heres bullatus-¹ ‘ Eodem jure’
is the mushroom sauce, not “ in eodem quo
parens mergebat,'’ as Ruperti says (after
Britannicus). He immediately afterwards
explains ‘mergere' by ‘devorare ς’ “nam
ficedulae totae a gulosis comedi solebant.”
They swallowed them therefore swimming
in the same sauce as their fathers swallowed

them in. Any one will see what ‘mergere’
is. The ‘ficedula' is the ‘beecafico’ of
modern Italy, which is also a regular visitor
of this country, and one of our sweetaet
songsters in spring and summer. Petty·
chaps is the English naturalist's name for
it. By the older English writers it was
called Cyprus-bird, and they speak of it as
a great delicacy (Penny Cyclopaedia). It
feeds upon different fruits, such as the
currant and grape; but its partiality for
the fig is shown by the circumstance that
it is found in England most abundantly on
the coast of Sussex, where that fruit is
finest. Gellius (xv. 8) says that epicures
would not have the whole of any birds
eaten but the ‘ficedula,' “negant ullam
avem praeter ficedulam totam comesse
oportere ’² (not swallowed at a mouthful
as Ruperti's language would lead one to
suppose). Martial makes the second sylla-
ble long ε

“ Οθέθα quae patulo lucet ficedula lumbo
⁰312& Me ῗὲἷῑῗῖὲῗὲρῗξιΐὸ ἒὲῗθ

Perhaps therefore ‘ficedulas' should be
pronouneed as a word of three syllables.

9. nebulone parente] I do not under-
stand Heinrich's explanation “ a patre gu-
loso.'' ‘Discere aliquo' is not Latin, as
