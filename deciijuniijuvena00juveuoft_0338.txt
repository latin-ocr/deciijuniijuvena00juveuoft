Caesaris armentum, nulli servire paratum
Privat03 siquidem Tyrio parere solebant
Hannibali et nostris ducibus regique Molosso
Horum majores ac dorso ferre cohortes,

Partem aliquam belli et euntem in proelia turrim.

Nulla igitur mora per Novium, mora nulla per Histrum
Pacuvium, quin illud ebur ducatur ad aras

Et cadat ante Lares Gallitae victima, sola

Tantis digna deis et captatoribus horum.

Alter enim, si concedas mactare, vovebit

De grege servorum magna et pulcherrima quaeque
Corpora, vel pueris et frontibus ancillarum
Imponet vittas, et si qua est nubilis illi

Iphigenia domi dabit hanc altaribus, etsi

Non sperat tragicae furtiva piacula cervae.

Laudo meum civem, nec comparo testamento
Mille rates : nam si Libitinam evaserit aeger,
Delebit tabulas, inclusus carcere nassae,

Post meritum sane mirandum, atque omnia soli

used in his African triumph by Cn. Pom-
peius (Pliny, H. N. viii. 2). C. Julius
Caesar had forty of them carrying torch-
l)earcrs in one of his triumphs (Sueton.
Julius Caesar, 37). Pliny says, 011 the
authority of Fenestella, that elephants
were first exhibited in the Circus in the
year B.c. 99 (H. N. viii. 7).

111. „Nulla igitur mora per Novium,]
This means that Novius and Pacuvius (who
may be any body, ii. 58, n.) are quite
ready, and the difficulty is not on their part
if it is not done, to offer elephants on the
altar of Gallita’s Lares. As to ‘ mora. nulla '
see vi. 333: “mora nulla per ipsam Quo-
minus imposito‚'' &c.

115. Alter enim, si concedas] ‘ Enim '
means they would not hesitate about an
elephant, for one of them would be quite
ready even to offer human sacrifices for the
life of the rich woman, or even his own
child as Agamemnon did, though he could
not expect her to be delivered and a hind
substituted in her place, as the story is
about Iphigenia. ‘ Tragicae ³ means that
this is the story in the Tragedians, as in
Euripides (Iph. 111 Tau1·is‚28): ἀλλ’ ἐξ·
ἔκλεψεν ἔλαφον ἀντιδοῦσά μοι Ἀρτεμις
Ἀχαιοῖς, where ἐξέκλεψε explains ‘ furtiva'

(v. 120). The offence requiring ‘piacu-
lum' was that Agamemnon had not ful-
filled a vow he had made to Artemis to
offer to her the most beautiful thing that
should be born 111 the year 1115 daughter

was born : he or the Argives had also shot
a hind loved by Diana.

121. Laudo meum civem] So the mas-
ter commended the unjust steward because
he was wise in his generation ε 118 says
ironically the safety of a thousand ships is
nothing compared with a will, for if the
sick man rccovers, he will unmake his will,
caught in the snare of the fisherman.
⁴ Nassa ³ is a snare made of ozie1·, and so
contrived that the fish that got in could not
get out again. Silius (V. 47, sqq.) describes
the way of making it. (See Forcellini.)
The best account of will hunting is in the
5th Satire of Horace’s second Book, where
the ‘ captator ’ appears as a fisherman, as
he does here : “ Plures adnabunt thunni et
cetaria crescent '' (V. 44). As to ‘ Libitina:
the goddess of funerals and all things per-
taining to the dead, see note on Hor. S. ii.
6. 19: “ Libitinae quaestus acerbae-'³
