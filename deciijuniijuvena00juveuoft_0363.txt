SATIRA XIV. 313

Perfidus, et nigri patietur carceris uncum, 2⁴5
Aut maris Aegaei rupem scopulosque frequentes
Exsulibus magnis. Poena gaudebis amara

Nominis invisi, tandemque fatebere laetus

Nec surdum nec Tiresiam quenquam esse deorum.

SATIRA XIV.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS satire contains some golden rules and is throughout written in J uvenal‘s best
style. It exposes one of the mdical causes of the prevailing immorality, which was the
contagious example and bad teaching of parentS, acting from their earliest years upon
their children. In a vicious home nothing but vice can be learnt: the sin of the father
is visited upon the son because the son conti-acts and exaggerates the father's vices : the
gamester begets gamesters ; the licentious beget profligates ; the spendthrift is the
father of spendthrifts and the miser of misers 5 partly from the force of infection and
partly because teaching cannot as a general rule rise above practice, and he who paradcs
hisfaults before his child cannot even reprove that child if he adopts them. There is
not a more pregnant sentence iu any author than that, “ Maxima debetur pueris
reverentia.'’ It is a truth which the better instincta of mankind at once acknowledge‚
and it could not have been better expressed or supported in more dignified language
than Juvenal has here used. It would have been pleasant if his experience or the scope
ofhis satire had admitted of his drawing a picture of a home in which virtue grows
by the same means as vice grows by in othon, and showing us how domestic example
and the influence of a happy home act on the characters of men and the well-being of
society.

The inherited vices Juvenal speaks of are gaming,1uxurious living, violence of temper,
contempt for inferiore, sensuality, extravagance, superstition, and avarice. The greater
part of the satire is taken up with the last, and the love of getting, for the sake of
having or for display, is traced from its earliest impression on the young mind, to which
in general it is not natural, through injustice, selfishness, crime, and danger, to the
miser-able anxiety that waits upon possession aster all has been done to secure it. Once
only he touches shortly on the influence of mothers’ example on their daughters. There
isas might beexpected a reference to the siinplicity of the olden time, and there are one
or two pictura, as of the anxious host (v. 59, sqq.) and the soldier’s family (166, sqq.)

such as Juvenal sketches with peculiar power.

ARGUMENT.

There's many au act of foul report, Fuscinas, leaving its stain for ever on young minds,
which parents teach their children both by precept and example. The old man
gamen, his boy too shakes the dice. What hope is there of him who learns in youth
to season fig-peckers and mmm-omns, taught by his father? Give him a thou·
