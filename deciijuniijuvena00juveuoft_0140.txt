Lucrinum ad saxum Rutupinove edita fundo

Et semel aspecti littus dicebat echini.

Traxerat attonitos et festinare coactos,
Tanquam de Cattis aliquid torvisque Sigambris

Tempora saevitiae, claras quibus abstulit Urbi
Illustresque animas impune et vindice nullo.
Sed periit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus
Coeperat: 1106 nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti.

which is the meaning of ‘alias fames,’ a
second and a third appetite. Ruperti
thinks Herminius is right in explaining
it as “famem Veneris? I think he is
wrong.

141. Rutupinove edilafundo] Rutupiae
is now Richborough near Sandwich‚ on the
Kentish coast. At Richborough there is a
strong Roman wall, which encloscs three
sides of a space of several aeres. The foun-
dation walls of an amphitheatre have also
been discovered here. There is a. note
upon oysters on Hor. S. ii. 4. 32, and ano-
ther on Epod. ii. 49.

147. Tanquam cle Cattis aliquid] In
Aa). 84 Domitian led an army against the
Catti and other German nations without
much success. But when he came back
to Rome he celebrated a triumph, and had
himself called Germanicus. The territories
of the Catti or Chatti lay north of the
Mam, west of the modern kingdom of
Saxony, including the principalities of Saxe
Coburg, Meiningen, and Gotha. The
Sigambri, who were a people on the east
side of the Rbine, north of the Ubii, were
threatened by Caesar, and left their coun-
try for a time with all their goods. (See
Caes. B. G. iv. 18, Long.) They after-
wards with other Germans defeated, in B.c.
16, M. Lollius in Gallia, but they were
subsequently completely subdued by Tibe-
11113, the stepson of Augustus.

148. tanquam diversis} Many MSS. have
‘et’ after ‘tanquam‚' which with others
Aehaintre and Heinrich do well to omit. It
is wanting in many of the old editions, and

among them the Editio Princeps. [Ribbeck
has ‘ 66 diversis.']

149. venisset epistola pentum] The Scho-
liast has the following note: “Antea si
quid nuntiabant consules in Urbem per
epistolas nuntiabant. Si victoriae. nuntia-
bantur laurus in epistola figebatur ; si au-
tem aliquid adversi pinna fig1¹batur.'’ And
Servius (on virgil, Aen. ix. 473, ‘⁸ Interea
pavidam volitans pennata per urbem Nun-
tia fama ruit ’') sayS, that messengers who
bore tidings of war were said ‘epistolas
pennatus afferre? Heinrich and some others
suppose that there is an allusion here to
‘litterae pennatae.5 Casaubon (on Sueto-
nius, vit. Aug. c. 27) (1611163 this, quoting
from Aristides the rhetorician a like ex-
pression with Juvenal's: μικρὸν φθάνουσι
(αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ) γραφεῖσαι καὶ πάρεισιν,
ὥσπερ ὑπὸ πτηνῶν φερόμεναι. There were
soldiers who had to do the work of inform-
ers in the camp, named from their duty
‘speculatores,’ and called by the Greek·
writers πτεροφόροι, but these it appears
were different from the ‘ tabellarii' or letter-
carriers. 1 think Casaubon is right, and
that the Scholiast’s note and that of Ser-
vius are not worth much. [Ribbeck has

‘pinna’

153. gerdonibus (sse timendus] “ When⁴
the noble citizens were all destroyed, and
there were none left but the lowest sort for
him to practise upon,’' is the Scholiast's
explanation. Vs'hat Juvenal means is, that
he had murdered the noblest citizens with
impunity; but when he began to praetise
upon the vulgar, they got rid of him. He
