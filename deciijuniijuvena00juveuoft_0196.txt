D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Dicendi genus, aut curtum sermone rotato

Torqueat enthymema, nee historias sciat omnes :
Sed quaedam ex libris et non intelligat.

450
Odi

Hanc ege, quae repetit volvitque Palaemonis artem,
Servata semper lege et ratione loquendi,
Ignotosque mihi tenet antiquaria versus,

Nec curanda viris opicae castigat amicae
Soloecismum liceat fecisse marito.

Verba.

455

Nil non permittit mulier sibi, turpe putat nil,
Quum virides gemmas collo circumdedit et quum
Auribus extentis magnos commisit elenchos.

Intolerabilius nihil est quam femina dives.

460

Interea foeda aspectu ridendaque multo
Pane tumet facies, aut pinguia Poppaeana
Spirat, et hinc miseri viscantur labra mariti.

449. eurtum sermone rotato] He calls
an enthymema ‘curtmn‚' ‘cui-tailed,'beeause
it is a syllogism with one of the premiscs
understood. The commentators quote in
illustration of ‘ sermone rotato Torqueat '
ν. 193 of the next Satire, “Felix orator
quoque maximus et jaculator ;'' and Mu-
retus (Var. Lect. viii. 21) quotes Plato
(Protagoras, p. 342), where, speaking of
the Lacedaemonians and their brevity of
speech, he says, ἐνέβαλε ῥῆμα ἄξιον λόγου
βραχὺ καὶ συνεστραμμένον ὥσπερ δεινὸς
ἀκοντίστης. [For ‘ curtum ’ Ρω, Jahn and
Ribbeck have ‘ curvum.']

451. et non intelligat] There is irony
here. “ Let her even not understand some
things in all the books '' in the world 3 let
it be possible she may be ignorant of some
few things.

452.repetitvolvitquePalaemonisarteom]
“Goes over again and again Palaemon’s
trade.” He was a grammarian, and ‘the
Scholiast says he was Quintilian's teacher.
She poises and measures her sentences by
strict rule, has by heart old poeti-y, corrects
the mistakes of her friend, such lnistakes
as not even men would notice. As to
‘ opicae‚' see S. iii. 207, n.

456. soloecismum liceat] ‘⁴ Let a man
have liberty to make a mistake before his
wife. at any rate.'’

457. Nil non permittit] The women
come next who spend large sums of money
in ornaments and dress to plcase their ad-
mirers, while they neglect their persons at
home. Necklaces were much worn by Ro-
man women, and eineralds were a favourite

stone for setting them off. Pearl carrings
also were fashionable. Pliny describes the
‘ elenchus ' as a long kind of pearl, ‘ fasti-
gata longitiuline,’ tapering to a point. He
adds, “hos digitis suspendere et binos ac
ternos auribus faeminarum gloria est.'’ (H.
N. ix. 35.) Seneca, among other extrava-
gances of luxury, says, “ video uniones non
singulos singulis auribus comparatos (jam
enim exercitatae aures oneri ferendo sunt) z
junguntur inter se et insuper alii binis su·
perponuntur. Non satis muliebris insania
viros subjecerat nisi bina ac terna patri-
monia auribus singulis pependissent.'' (De
Benefic. vii. 9.)

460. Intolerabilius nihil est] Heinrich
considers this verse spurious [and Ribbeck]
Those that follow have been variously
arranged by the editors. I do not find
that the MSS. vary, but 461-463 may,
perhaps, be better after 464-466, as Jahn
has placed them [and Ribbeck] ‘ Interea’
otherwise is not very intelligible.

462. Pane iuirzetfaeies‚] We have seen
how Otho covered his face with moist
bread to soften the skin. That seems to
have been a common practice, the bread
being dipped in asses' milk. Poppaea Sa-
bina, the wife of Nero, who was a beautiful
woman and took care of her beauty, bathed
in asses’ milk, as Pliny tells us (H. N. xi.
41. xxviii. 12), and Dio (62. 28), τήν τε γὰρ
ὥραν καὶ τὴν λαμπρότητα τοῦ σώματος
λαμπρῶς ἐσπουδάκει. She may have in-
vented some plaster for preserving the
skin, and which is here called ‘pinguia
Poppaeana.'
