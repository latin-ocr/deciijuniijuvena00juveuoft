SATIRA ΙΙΙ.

Helleborum frustra cum jam cutis aegra tumebit
Poscentes videas : venienti occurrite morbo:

Et quid opus Cratero magnos promittere montes?

05

Discite, io miseri, et causas cognoscite rerum,
Quid sumus, aut quidnam victuri gigniinur; ordo
Quis datus, et metae qua mollis flexus et unde3
Quis modus argento, quid sas optare, quid asper

Utile nummus habet; patriae carisque propinquis

Quantum elargiri deceat ; quem te Deus esse
J ussit, et humana qua parte locatus es in re.
Disce, neque invideas quod multa fidelia putet

63. Helleborum frustra] This is the
golden rule, ‘principiis obsta? We lose
sight of the young inan now, and go ou to
general topics. As to ‘helleborum ’ see S.
i. 51,n. Craterus was a physieian ofCicero’s
time, and attended Atticus’ daughter.
Persius uses his name for any eminent
man of his profession, as Horace does
S. ii. 3. 161, “Craterum dixisse putato.”
¹ Magnos promittere montes ' is a prover-
bial hyperbole, ‘ auri ' being understood.
See Juvenal, xii. 129, “ montibus aurum ex-
aequet.'’ In Sallust (Cat. 23) Q. Curius is
said to promise Fulvia scas and mountains
of money : “ Repente glorians maria mon-
tesque polliceri coepit.” In Terence (Phor-
mio i. 2. 18), we have “modo non montes
auri pollicens.” Passow and Jahn have a
comma at ‘morb0,' and connect that sen-
tence with the following : “ Meet the dis-
case as it comes and then what need of a
doctor ?'’ The rest of the editors have the
punctuation of the text, and it appears to
me right. He says, “Meet the disease
when it begins, or you may find it is too
late. Besides, what is the use of promising
monntains of gold to Craterus ?'’ that is, of
throwing away your money as well as risk-
ing youghlifei Orelli reads ‘ecquid ² on his
own an on y.

66. Discite, io miser-22] These verses
have been much quoted. They will be
found in Augustin, de civ. Dei, ii. 6, and
John of Salisbnry, Nugae, dne. iii. 2. Bar-
thius (Adv. xlii. 5) is the first to quote
them with the opening ‘ Discite, io miseri?
The reading of most MSS. is ‘discite, o
miseri‚’ and all the editors but Heinrich
have that reading or ‘discite et.' Some
years ago Ι corrected Augustin's quo-
tation from ‘ o ’ to ‘ io‚’ and 1 believe that
is the right form. The exhortation goes
ou, “Learn then, ye sufferers, and get
wisdom.” ‘Discite ’ is used absolutely,

as in 73. ‘ Causas rerum ' arc herc the
principles not of natural, but of moral
philosophy. Casaubon oempares Juvenal,
viii. 84: “ Et propter vitain vivendi per-
dere causa5.” ‘ Quid sumu& ‘ what we
are,' our nature as rational beings; ‘quid-
nam victuri gignimur,’ ‘ with what prospects
we were born,’ that is generally, as men and
women. Casaubon quotes from Marcus
Antoninus (viii. 52) ε ὁ μὴ εἰδὼς πρὸς ὅτι
πέφυκεν οὐκ οἶδεν ὅστις ἐστίν. ‘ Ordo’ is
our place, as the chariots at starting were
placed according to lot. This refers to the
relations of rich and poor, high and low,
and so forth. The turning of the ‘ meta ’
was a matter of difficulty, and here accord-
ingly it represents any critical point in the
race of life, which it behoves us to foi-esee
and be ready to meet. The way of turning
easily. and the point from which the prepa—
ration should begin‚ are matters (he means)
for nice consideration. The driver who
should bring his chariot hcadlong up to the
goal would break down as he turned it. He
must take a sweep and judge accurately
where the bend should begin. ‘Quem te
Deus esse jussit’ is different from ‘quid
sumus ;' as the latter refers to our general
condition, the other to the particular des-
tiny we are called upon to fulfil, according
to the position God has given us in the
world. There is emphasis therefore in ‘ te.’
73. Disce, neque invideas] He says
learn and do not envy those who have
slaved for country clienta and got their
larder stored with such quantities of pro-
visions as they can never eat. ‘ F idelia ’ we
have had above, 22. ‘ Putet' means that
there is so much that it gets bad before he
can eat it. Juvenal describes the same sort
of payment given to advocates, vii. 119:

“ Quod vocis pretium? siccus petasuncu-
lus et vas
