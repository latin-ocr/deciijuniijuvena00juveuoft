2. sedem figere Cumis] The town of “Sumne probus, sum lepidus civis, qui
Cumae was not so much frequented by the Atticam hodic civitatem
Romans as Baiae and the towns that lay Maxumum majorem feci, atque auxi-cive
within the Sinus Cumanus (the bay of faemina?”
Naples). Juvenal calls it ‘vacuis' Horace
speaks of ‘vacuum Tibur' (Epp. i. 7. 45),
and ‘vacuas Athenas' (Epp. ii. 2. 81), where
he means ‘idle.' Juvenal has “pannosus
vacuis aedilis Ulubris” (x. 102). He says
Umbricius is gone to give one Roman citizen

4. Jamca Baiarum] Cumae was about
four miles north-west of Baiae, and six from
the headland of Misenum. It was not
situated on the pleasant bay (‘ amoeni se-
cessus’) that bore its name, but the Via Do-

to the Sibyl, which shows the town was but
little frequented. The supposed residence
of the Sibyl at Cumae was a large artificial
cave which existed till the middle of the
sixth century, when it was destroyed by
Narses, the Roman general who expelled
the Goths from Italy. Virgil describes it
as ‘antrum immane’ (Aen. vi. 11), and the
rock out of the face of which it was hewn
‘ Euboica rupes‚’ the Chalcidians of Euboea
and the Cymaeans of Aeolis being the re-
puted founders of Cumae. Ovid mentions
it as ‘vivacis antra Sibyllae? There are
some remains of such a cavern still, and it
is supposed to have been the Sibyl's.

3. unum civem] Plautus (Persa iv. 3. 5)
has a like passage:

mitiana, which had lately been coustructed,
and which was a branch of the Via Appia
from Sinuessa, led to Cumae, from whence
there was an older road that led to the
prineipal towns on the hay, round which it
passed to Surrentum, on the opposite pro-
montory. Hence it is called ‘janua Baia-
rum.³ See note on Hor. Epp. i. 15. 11,
“non mihi Cumas est iter aut Baias.'’ Mi-
senum, Bauli, Baiae, Puteoli, Neapolis,
were all favourite resorts of the wcalthy
Romans lying on this ‘gratum littus‚’
which was so thickly studded with houses
that, according to Strabo, they looked like
one, town (v. 247).

island (now called Procida) of volcanic for-
