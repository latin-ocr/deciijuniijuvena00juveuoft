67. laxare seminia] The MSS. are not
all agreed as to the reading, and the Scho-
liast has a note of which the reading and
sense are doubtful. Most MSS. have ‘ sa-
ginis;’ Jahn reads ‘saginae‚’ with no au-
thority. He under-stands therefore the
meaning to be, ‘hasten to relieve your sto-
mach, to make way for the fish,' which was
not an uncommon practice. Other editors
take it the same way. I agree with Hein-
rich, who reads ‘saginis' with nearly all the
MSS„ and explains ‘laxare ’ to mean that
he was to distend his belly with good
things. ‘ Sagina’ is used for any good dish.
[Ribbeck has ‘sagenisss

69. Ipse capi voluit] Τ119 man declares
the fish wanted to be caught, to have the
honour of being caten by the emperor.
What could be more glaring? But the
great man swallows it, and his feathers rise
at the flattery. Ruperti says this inter-
pretation will not do. The fishermau says
“ Quid apertius ?” “ What is clearer than
that the fish wanted to be caught ?'' But,
says Juvenal, the fish puts up his back
with indignation, by way of rcfuting the
complimeut. It appears Ruperti has
found somebody to approve of this.

71. dis aequa potestas] Suetonius says
that Domitian caused all letters to his pro·
curatores to begin with “ Dominus et Dens
noster sic fieri jubet ;” and that after he
had established this practice he was always
addressed so. Martial has (v. 8) “Edictum
Domini Deique nostri.’' Aurelius Victor
(de Caes. c. 39) says of him, “ More Cali-
gulae Dominum sese Deumque dici coe-
git.” ‘ Diis aequa' however is only (as the
commentators say) an adaptatiou of the
Greek ἰσόθεος.

75. Liburno] 'rhe praeco who summoned

the senate was a Liburnian slave (iii. 240).
He eries out that the emperor has taken
his seat, and Pegasus snatches up his
‘abolla’ and runs to attend the meeting.
Pegasus was a jurist of eminence in this
and the preceding reigns. The Scholiast
says he was the son of a trierarch (which
would imply that he was a Greek), and got
his name from the figure-head of his father’s
ship; and that he had such a remarkable
memory he was called ‘ liber,' a book ε that
he discharged several offic-es, and was finally
appointed ‘praefectus Urbi,’ as we see here.
'l'here are difficulties in the Scholia, but
they are not important in this place. Cra-
mer and Schopen (Heinrich’s edition, p.
366) have discussed them sufficiently.
From ‘abolla’ the commentators derive an
allusion to the man’s being a. Stoie. But
see note in 111. 115.

77. attonitaepositusmodo villicus Urbzl]
The office of ‘praefectus Urbi ' under the
emperors was different from that in the
earlier days of the republie. It was in-
stituted by Augustus for the purpose of
maintaining order in the city, and grew to
be the first magistracy 111 power and 1111-
portance. It might be held for many years.
‘ Positus ' is used for ‘appointed,’ as ‘ prae-
positus ' usually is. ‘ Attonitae ' means
‘ stupefled,’ which Heinrich says expresses
the state of the whole Roman world. ‘Vil-
licus' is explained on iii. 195. Juvenal says
that the ‘ praefecti Urbi ' in those days
when Pegasus was appointed (111 Vespasian's
reign) were only stewards of the emperor.
Ruperti adopts Manso's explanation of ‘at-
tonitae‚’ which he says expresses the asto-
nishment of the city at getting a ‘villicus'
when they expected a praefectus, because
‘villici' were slaves. This is hardly worth
