D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid refert? Vendunt nullo cogente Nerone,
Nec dubitant celsi Praetoris vendere ludis.

Finge tamen gladios inde, atquc hinc pulpita pone :

Quid satius? Mortem sic quisquam exhorruit ut sit
Zelotypus Thymeles, stupidi collega Corinthi?
Res haud mira tamen citharoedo Principe mimus

of the ‘ludi publiei’ were under the manage-
ment of the aediles. Under the empire the
aediles had inferior functions, and the office
fell into disrepute. The public games and
theatrieal representations were thencefor-
ward managed by the praetors. The praetor
sat on his curule chair, raised above the
other seats. aud he is therefore called
‘celsi.' Below (x. 36) Juvenal speaks of
the praetor as “curribus altis Exstantem, et
medio sublimem in pulvere Circi.'' Many
editions have Celsi as if it were a proper
name, and so the Scholiast understood it.
In vi. 380 the singer was spoken of as
‘ vocem vendentis praetoribus? See S. xiv.
257 : “ Nulla aequare queas praetoris pulpita
lauti.” According to Dion, Augustus caused
a law to be passed forbidding senators to
become gladiators or actors, but he allowed
equites to gointo the arena. (See also Sueton.
August. e. 43.) Nero (Sueton. Nero, c. 12)
“ exhibuit ad ferrum etiam quadringentos
senatores sexcentosque equites Romanos et
quosdam fortunae atque existimationis inte-
grae: ex iisdem ordinibus confectores quo-
que ferarum et varia arenae ministeria :''
where the numbers may be corrupt. This
is what Juvenal refers to in ‘ nullo cogente
Ncrone.' [Ribbeck omits v. 194]

195. Finye tamen gladios] He says,
suppose this choice were given you of the
sword or the stage, who would hesitate be-
tween death and degradation Ρ As to ‘ pul-
pita' see iii. 174, n. Jahn has ‘poni' from
P. Ruperti conjectured the same 3 [and
Ribbeck has it.] ‘ Pone ³ is better. Thy-
mele the ‘mima ³ has been mentioned be-
fore, with her partncr Latinus (i. 36).
Zelotypus (S. v. 45, n.) is the jealous hus-
band in the play, as ‘ stupidus ³ is the
bloekhead who got knocked about. Corin-
thus seems to have been famous in this
part. Nothing more is known of him.
Ncro's pride in his musical attainments is
well known from Tacitus Suetonius, Dion
Cassius, and other authors. ‘ Mimus ³ and
‘planipes' (v.191) are the same. Unlike the
Greeks, from whom the word is borrowed,
the Romans gave the name to the actor as

Haec ultra quid erit nisi ludus? Et illud

well as to the play, as to the nature of which
see note on Horace, S. i. 10. 6 : “ Et La-
beri mimos ut pulcra poemata mirer.”

198. mimus] N early all the MSS.have
‘natus' and many of the old editions. It
is hard to make sense of it, and ‘ mimus ’
is the true reading. It is in P., and the
Scholiast had it, as his explanation shows:
‘⁶ N on est turpe nobilem mimum agere cum
ipse imperator citharoedus sit et in scena
cantaverit.”

199. Haec ultra qnid erit nisi ludus ?]
He says, ‘After this (if we go on in this
way) what shall we have at Rome but
shows Ρ ' ‘ Ludus ³ 01· ‘ res ludicrae ’ in-
cluded theatrical and gladiatoria] and all
other shows. ‘ Illud' refers to what follows,
which is an instance. ‘ Et ³ is used in this
way, introducing an illustration. “And here
you have a disgrace to the town.'' Most
Mss. have ‘illics [and Ribbeck has it.]
But ‘illud ³ is better, though ‘ illie’ would
do, not in the sense Ruperti gives it, ‘in
arena,' which he says “durius est,” but
‘in this too? Gracchus with a. ‘fuscina'
(or trident) and tunic as a ‘ retiarius ' has
been mentioned before (ii. 143, where see
note). The especial disgrace of the >person
referred to under this name is, that he
preferred fighting as a ‘retiarius' whose
arms and dress gave him no disguise‚
since he wore no helmet or shield, aud
nothing but a cap (galerum, v. 208) and
short tunic, so that every body could see
and recognize his face. The ‘ mirmillones ’
were also called Galli, being armed like
the Gauls with a helmet, short sword, and
oblong shield covering the greater part of
their body. The Sanmites (so called after
the people of that name, whose armour
they wore) were armed like the ‘mirmil-
lones,' the only difference being in the shape
of the helmet. The Thraces also had shields‚
helmets, and swords, but the shields were
round. Representations of these may be
seen in Smith’s Dict. Ant„ ‘ Gladiatores’
(see note on vi. 255). ‘Falce' means a
‘short sword 3' and ‘ supina,' ‘upturned.’
Heinrich says it is ‘inem-va? I am not
