with the toilette, were called generally
‘ox-natrices? This Psecas was one. Itis
the name of one of Diana's nymphs in
Ovid (Met. iii. 172). Her impatient mis-
tress has pulled the poor girl's hair and
torn her tunic from her shoulders, and
lias the lash (taurea) or cow-hidc laid on
her for not arranging her curls as she
wishes: that is to say, she blames her

, maid for her own ugly nose, which defies

all the arts of hair-drEEsing. Another
slave arranges the left side of the head,
and an old woman of long experience and
others of less are called in to give their
opinions. ‘ Crimen facinusque' make one
sub'ect.
4¹97. materna admotaque lanis] The
common reading is ‘matrona,' but the
Scholiast and Pithoeus’ Ms. and some
others have ‘materna,' which the Scho-
liast explains, “quae fuerat matris,” a
slave who had belonged to the woman's
mother. Heinrich, Jahn [and Ribbeck]
adopt this reading, which is also in the
editions of Rigaltius (Paris, 1613) and
Pithoeus (1585). She had 01100 practised
with the crisping-pin (acu), but was dis-
charged (emerita) from that duty, and was
made ‘ lanipendia‚’ the woman who super-
intended the spinning department.

500. Censebuut,] ‘ Sententiass ‘censere'
are words taken from the senate, which is
expressed in ‘ consilio?

502. Tot premit ordinibu³‚] “With so
many layers she loads her head, with so
many stories, another and still another
(adhuc), she builds it up.'’ From this de-
scription of the hair Achaintre confirms

satire was written in the time of Trajan.
He says that the medals representing the
J uliae, Agrippinae, and Domitia show the
hair loosely flowing 011 1110 head and tied
behind 3 while those of Plotina, Marciana,
and Matidia, the wife, sister, and niece of
Trajan, of Sabina, Hadrian's wife, and the
two Faustinae, show it piled up as Juvenal
describes. This remark may be verified
so far as regards the ladies before and
during the reign of Trajan, by referring to
their names in Smith's Dict. Biog. The
fashion described by Juvenal seems to
have been a little moditied in Hadrian's
reign, and a good deal altered after that.
Achaintre got his remark from Valesius,
who adds that the fashion was first con·
demned by Faustina, wife of Antoninus.
She wore her hair plain„ as her medals
show.

503. Andromachen a fronte videbis,]
Andromache appears to have been prover-
bial for tallness. Ovid says (A. A. ii.

“ Omnibus Andromache visa est spatiosior
aequo:
Unus qui modicam diceret Hector erat.’'

Martial describes a dwarf thus:

“ Si solum spectes hominis caput, Hectora

Sint‘iiiiltbein videas, Astyanacta putes.”
(xiv. 212.)

‘come tell me.' See S. xiii. 210, and Pers.
