SATIRA XVI. 359

does not amount in my opinion to sufficient evidence against the anthenticitv of the
satire. The only MSS. from which it is distinctly said to be absent are the two
Copenhagen noticed by Heinrich, who does not mention their ages. What Lnbinns
says is only repeated from others, whom he does not mnne, while if Scaliger renlly said
to Lubiu'us what he attributes to him, his opinion must he allowed great weight. lf hc
did not, then Lubinus' word is worth nothing. The date of the principal Scholinm is
uncertain, and the observation it contains makes no reference to MSS.; and though
the Scholium shows that the satire. was by many not thought to be Juvenal’s, it does
not say on what grounds they “ exploded ’' it. An opinion founded only on the merits
osa work like this would not be worth more in the third century than now.

That the poem is complete no one can say, whether it bc Juvenal's or another’s‚
and one who had set himself to imitate Juvenal, and had the ability to do it as wellas
this writer, is not likely to have published a fragment or a composition so defective in
order and integrity as this. I do not think with Heinrich that it is begging the question
to say it is only a fragment. It seems to me impossible to view it in any other light
than that of an unfinished poem, and I think it may very well have been a posthuinous
publication of ·J uvenal’s. I cannot otherwise account for its publication at all, for as a
whole it is without point ς while nevertheless it contains some good writing worthy of
Juvenal, and might have been expanded, if the author had finished it according to his
design, into a very amusing satire. thoever the writer was, it is to be regretted for
historical purposes he did not finish his work, for it relates to a subject, Roman military
life, which is full of interest.

Heinrich is right in saying that to judge of the authenticity of a work by the style
and manner and language is unsafe, that the valne of such judgment depends on the
capacity of the critic, and that it requires peculiar skill and natural instincts‚ which are
not common. But iu this instance, where it is not denied by those who think Juvenal
may be the author that the work is not in the state in which if he had finished it we
should now have had it, this sort of sagacity is not wanted. The satire is in a con-
‚dition in which no author of so much capacity would have given it to the world who
wished to gain reputation by it, and no author of reputation would have published it in
his lifetime, though he might have made it known to his friends. The person who
wrote v. 7 (which Heinrich rejects without good reason) must have intended to write
more on the subject that verse introduces, and he who should bring in a single exam-
ple by an exordium plainly intended for several and not see thatqhe was bungling, could
never have written the verses in which that example is set forth.

1 do not think then there is sufficient reason for supposing the fragment spurious, or
the partial rejection of it in early times to have proceeded from any other cause than its
imperfect character.

The satire is in the form of an epistle like the last, and it professes to set forth the
advantages of a military life, looking at it as a young man might when tired of a.
civilian's restraint& Of these advantages the wm'ter instances the liberty of the soldier
to assault a civilian without any fear of an aetion for damages, for the soldier can only
be tried in camp, and if a townsman eomes there for redress he may get a rude sort of
justice from a court-martial, but the whole camp will make him rue his revenge. Then
justice in civil courts is attended with many delays, while in the camp it is prompt
and decisive. Besides which a father has no power over his son’s military earnings, and
the soldier can make a will of his own.

This is literally the whole of the satire. It is as much a satire upon the camp as the
town, and so probably it would have been carried ont in a variety of comparisons
between the soldier and civilian. Assuming Juvenal to be the author of the satire we
need not imagine (as the old commentators did) any particular circumstances having
given riso to it. The subject is one that might have suggested itself to any one, and
