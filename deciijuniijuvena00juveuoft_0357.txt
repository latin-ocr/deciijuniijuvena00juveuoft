157. eustos Gallicus Vrbis] Rutilius
Gallicus was Praefectus Urbi in the reign
of Domitian. Respeetiug that office sec
note on S. iv. 77. Statius wrote a poem
in honour of him (Silv. i. 4). Juvenal
says in his house his friend might hear
such a catalogue of crimes as would teueh
him a little more of human nature than he
was yet aequainted with. After spcuding
a few days there (‘ibi' may be inferred
from ‘ illinc’) he would hardly venture to
call himself a miserablc man. As to ‘ quota
pars ’ see S. 111. 61, 11. z “quota portio
faecis Achaei ?” The name of Domitian’s
Gallicus is used for the Praefectus Urbi of
the day, whocver he waS, if the date appu-
rently pointed out by v. 17 be the true one.

162. Quis tumidum quitur] This is the
diseasc known as goitre, or by medical men
as bronchocele. There is an article on the
subject under the latter name in the Penny
Cyclopaedia. The suffer-ers were called ‘ gut-
turosi.’ As to the sweued breast in Meroe
nothing is known. The country is men-
tioned in vi. 528. Some commentator-5
suppose Juvenal speaks from observation.
As to his supposed residenee in Egypt see
Introduction. Tacitus says of the Ger-
mane, “ habitus corporum quanquam in
tanto hominum numero idem omnibus;
truces et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae, mag-
na corpora et tantum ad impetum valida”
(Germ. e. 4, where Lipsius has a long
note on hair). Horace speaks of “ fera
caerulea. Germania pube ’' (Epod. xvi. 7).
Ruperti has given a large supply of refer-
enceS. ‘ Germanum ' must be supplied for
‘ torquentem?

166. ,Nempe quod haec illis] Heinrich
rejects this verse. I think it necessary to
thc argument. ‘Nempe quod' assumes
that the auswer to the foregoing questions
is ‘NemQ' and liis meaning is that as
some one feature runs through each of
thcsc different pcopleS‚ and therefore no-
body is astonished when hc sees it among
them, so it is at Rome where villainous
characters abound, and nobody is surprised
to find them ; any more than among the
pigmies any body laughs at the ridiculons
fights between those little people and the
cranes. Thc point of the illustration is in
the last linc, the size of the people. They
arc allone height, and so they are not re-
markable. It is a curious thought. Some-
thing that does not appear may have sug-

ested it.

g 167. Ad subitas Thracum volueres]
These are the cranes of which Threiciae,
Strymoniae, are perpetual epithets. The
pigmies have been referred to before (vi.
506). Their home the fable leaves uncer-
tain. The cranes' crookcd talons have
scandalized some connncntators- I dare
say Juvenal believed they had talons. It
answcred his purpose at any rate to repre-
sent them SO, and he thought nothing
more about it. In the East the sudden
appearance of clouds of birds, no one cun
tell where from, when any prey is to be got,
is very surprising. This is cxpressed in
‘subitas.’ The cry of the crane is such
that the floek may be heard very high
up in the air after it has passed out of
sight.
