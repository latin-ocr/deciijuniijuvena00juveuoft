means any person of good family who was
reduced to aeting on the stage in a low
farce of Catullus (see S. xiii. 111, n.).
‘Siparium' is properly a stage curtain:
herc it stands for the theatro. The name
of the ‘ mimus' is the (most, and it was
probably full of coarse, nois-y sun. ‘In-
famia’ was a consequence of appear-ing on
a public stage as an actor. Laureolus was
the title of another ¹ minius ' by the same
author, and Lentulus is another patrician.
The name belonged to the Cornelia gens.
This play was celebrated. Laureolus, the
principal character, was erueitietl for some
delinquency. Josephus says he was a rob—
ber (Ant. xix. 1). Juvenal says the man
who acted him, vigorously and even well,
ought to have been hanged in reality.
Martial speaks of a parricide who was
condemned to act Laureolus, and was torn
in pieces by a bear as he hung on the
cross:

“Nuda Caledonio sic pectora praebuit urso
Non falsa pendeus in cruce Laureolus.'’
(Speet. vii.)

Suetonius speaks of this play as acted before
Caligula (Calig. c. 57).

190. triscurria patriciorum] This word
‘ triscurria ’ is not found elsewhere. The
Scholiast, whose note is corrupt, has been
mended in various ways. According to
Heinrieh's reading it is “triscurria patri-
ciorum : jocos, tres cursus nobilium fabulas
agentium: dietum quia tres simul exeunt
quamvis aliquid quaerentes.'' “Quamvis
pro valde, eupide,'’ says Heinrich, but
perhaps it should be ‘quasi‚' as Sehopen
suggests. This interpretation derives the
word from ‘eurro,’ as if the men in the
play ran off the stage and on again, back-
wards and forwards, for nothing. But the
more likely derivation, according to which
the Scholiast’s note has been altered from
‘ tres cursus' to ‘ tres scurras‚’ is from
‘scurra' and ‘ triscurria' are buffooneries
of the lowest kind, ‘tri' having, asin several
other words, an intensive meaning (see
Porcell.). Britannicus quotes Plautus (Ru-

Quanti sua funera vendant

dens, iii. 4. 29): ‘⁴ Tune, trifurcifer, mihi
audes inclementer dicere ?'’ and again
(Bacch. iv. 6. 15), “ ut pergraecetur tecum,
trivenetice.” Ifthe word were compounded
of ¹ curr0,’ it would be ‘ tricurria,' for ‘ tris ’
is Greek, as Heinrich observes. All the old
commentators take it this way, except oue
or two, who alter and spoil the text.

191. Planipecles audit Fabios‚] As to
the Fabii see v. 14. ‘ Planipedes ’ were
actors in ‘mimi,' so called because they
wore nothing on their feet. The Mamerci
were a family of the Aemilia gens, patri-
cians. As to ‘ alapas,' see S. v. 171 : “ pul-
sandum vertice raso Praebebis quandoque
caput,’' and note.

192. Quanti suafunera vendant] “ How
much they sell their lives for, what matter Ρ
They sell them compelled by no tyrant, nay,
they sell them without hesitation at the ex·
alted praetor's games.'' Lipsius (Saturn.
ii. 3) shows from various sources how pa-
tricians and equites hired themselves as
gladiators, and that is what Juvenal is
now come to (S. ii. 143). Frecmen who
sold their services for this purpose were
called ‘auctorati’ (see note on Hor. S. ii.
7. 59 : “ auctoratus eas ”). For ‘ funera’
Dobree suggests ‘ munera ' (Adv. ii. p.
387) ; [and Ribbeck accepts it.] ‘ M u-
nera* is never used in that sense. ‘ Munus
edere ' is said of the person who gives the
show. Madvig (followed by Mr. Mayor)
has a strange explanation for ‘ sua funera :'
they sell not themselves, for they (the no-
bility) are extinet through their own mis-
conduet, but the dead remains of their
order. Manilius (lib. iv. quoted by Lipsius
l. e.) says of these ‘ auctorati,’ “ Nunc
caput in mortem vendunt ct funus arenae,’'
and Lactantius (lib. v. c. 9) complains of
the wic-kedness of priests (see note on 207).
“ qui nee vitae quidem suae parcant, sed
extinguendas publice animas vendant.” It
would seem impossible to mistake J uvenal’s
meaning. Seneca says, “Aspice illos ju-
venes quos ex nobilissimis domibus in are-
nam luxuria conjecit !’' extravagance drove
them to it. In the time of the republic most
