Pectora vestra duas non admittentia curas?

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

65

Magnae mentis opus nec de lodice paranda
Attonitae currus et equos faciesque deorum
Aspicere et qualis Rutulum confundat Erinnys.
Nam si Virgilio puer et tolerabile deesset

Hospitium, caderent omnes a crinibus hydri ;
Surda nihil gemeret grave buccina.

Poscimus ut sit

Non minor antiquo Rubrenus Lappa cothurno,

founded it. Crissa was the original seat of
the worship of Apollo, afterwards trans-
ferred to Delphi in its neighbourhood3 and
in this way Cirrha came to be associated
with Apollo, who is the ‘ dominus Cirrhae '
here referred to. Nysa is a name given to
several places where Bacchus was wor-
shipped, having originally belonged to that
(wherever it was) which reared him as a
child. The locality of the original Nysa is
generally placed by the pocts in the Pun-
jaub. ‘ Feruntur ' are carried away, borne
headlong ; as “ quin per mala praeceps Fer-
tur, uti pulvis collectus turbine '³ (Hor. S. i.
4. 30). The word is used for madness or
(as here) inspiration or other strong excite-
ment. (See Burmann 011 Ovid, Her. xv.
140.) P. and many MSS. and the Scho-
liast have ‘ vestra? Ruperti has edited from
others ‘nostra.' M. lias ‘voces' for ‘curas,'
with that word in the margin. There is one
other MS. (Kulenkamp's Ruperti calls it)
with this reading, which is that of Cal-
derini's editions, 1475, &c., and no others.
Calderini does not notice the word.

66. lodice paranda Attonitae] ‘ Lodix,'
a blanket or other bed-covering‚ is used
before, S. vi. 195. He uses ‘attonitae ' for
‘ perplexed‚' as the word belongs to the sub-
ject. It is equivalent to ἐμβρόντητος, and
represents 0118 inspired, as in Horace, C.
iii. 19. 13:

“Qui Musas amat impares
V Ίὲ811105 181· cyathos attonitus petet
a 85.’

68. Rutulum confundat Erinnys] This
is Alecto, whom J uno moved to inflame
Turnus with jealousy when Latinus gave his
daughter Lavinia to Aeneas. See Virg. Aen.
vii. 420, sqq. In vii. 450 he says, “ geminos
erexit crinibus angues Verberaque insonuit
rabidoque haec addidit ore ;'' and else-
where 110111 1118 top of a rock she sounds a
blast upon her horn with which the for-ests
and rivers are startled, mothers press their
babes to their bosom, and all the country
people are roused to arms ε

“ Tum vero ad vocem celeres qua buccina
signum
Dira dedit raptis concurrunt undique

Indblrliiiti agricolae‚'' &c. (519, sqq.)

All this roaring and snake-lifting the poet
would not have been able to invent if he had
not been in easy circumstances, if he had not
had a slave or two and a pretty good house.
Virgil had a good deal more than this. He
had property, as 15 well known from his first
Eclogue, 111 1115 native place; and he got
liberal presents from Augustus and others,
with which he bought a house near the gar-
dens of his friend Maecenas on the Esqui-
line. Horace refers to Augustus' liberality
in his epistle to the emperor (ii. 1. 245,
sqq.) :
“At neque dedecorant tua (18 se judicia
atque
Munera, quae multa dantis cum laude
tulerunt
Dilecti tibi Virgilius Variusque poetae?

On this passage one of the Scholiasts says
that Augustus gave Virgil and Varius each
a million sesterces. (See note 011 Hor.
S. i. 5. 40.

69. tolegabile deesset] M. and most
MSS. have ‘ (185113 P. has ‘ deesset‚' which
the modern editors have done well 10 adopt.
Most old editions have ‘ desit?

71. Surda nihil yemeret grave buccina]
‘ Surdus’ is used for one dumb as well as
deaf. Propertius applies it to the lyrez
“ Istius tibi sit surda sine aere lyra ” (iv. 5.
56). See Forcellini, and below, xiii.194. The
‘ buceina' or ‘ bucina’ was the oldest wind in-
strument, and was a ruder sort of ‘ cornu.'
ovid (Met. i. 335) describes it as a very
noisy one and spiral, bulging out at the end.
There are two woodcuts representing ‘ buc-
cinae ’ in Smith's Dict. Ant. s. v.‚ where
further information may be got. ‘Gemeret ’
15 like ‘nullo gemit hic tibicina cornu.'
He applies the word to any loud discordant
sound. Virgil calls it ‘ Tartaream vocem’
(Aen. vii. 514).
