Memnon, the son of Eos 31111 Tithonus,
was a Greek adaptation from the name of
several Egyptian kingS, phamenoth or
Amenophth. The priests' jugglery may
have ariscn out of the fabulous birth the
Greeks attributed to Memnon as son of the
morning. These and other particulars will
be found in most books on Egyptian an-
tiquiticS‚ and a plain account is given in
ΜΓ. Long’s work on that subject, Vol. i.
p. 258, sqq.

6. Atque vetus Thebe] The notion that
ancient Thebes had a hundred gates was
derived from Homer, and was received like
other poetical fables by the Greeks and
Romans without much inquiry. Diodorus,
however, the only ancient writer who has
left a description of Thebes (i. e. 45, sqq.)‚
treats it as a fable. Thebes was perhaps
the most ancient town of Egypt, and was
originally the metropolis and residence of
the kings whose tombs are among the
astonishing ruins that remain to this day.
The Persians under Cambyses about Rc.
520 pillaged and partly destroyed the tem-
ples and burnt the private dwellingS. The
city never recovered its magnificence‚ and
was never afterwards the seat of govern-
ment. Its downfall was completed about
B.C. 85, when the inhabitants, having rc-
volted from Ptolemy Lathyms, it was
taken after a three years' siege and pil-
laged. At that time it was known by the
Greek name Diopolis. Strabo, in the
place quoted in the last note, describes it
as in his day a city of ruins eovering a
space of eighty stadia (ten miles) in circuit,
while the inhabitants occupied, as they do
still, a few villagcs on each side of the
river. The effect of the ruins is usually
described as overpowering. One sentence
of Belzoni’s expresses this effect: “ It ap-
peared to me like entering a city of giants,
who after a long conflict were all destroyed,
leaving the ruins of their various temples
as the only proofof their former existence’'

is the Grzeel 11 ord foi a cat (αιλουρος). This

animal was chiefly worshipped in the city
of Bubastis 011 thc Pelusiae branch of the
Nile. It was sacred to the goddess Pasht,
corrupted by the Greeks into Bubastis, and
identified by them with Artemis (Herod.
ii. 59, 137). Pasht was represented with a
cat's head, as may be seen in Plate 35 a.
Vol. i. p. 382 of VVilkinson's Ancient
Egyptians At Bubastis catis were ein-
balmed and buricd (Herod. ii. 66, 67).
Diodorus (i. 83) tells an anecdote of a
Roman soldier accidentally killing a cat
and being put to death by the populace in
a state of great excitement‚ so that neither
the remonstranccs of their magistrates nor
fear of the Romans could prevent them
from this abominable murder. Diodorus
says 110 saw this himself. W ilk 1115011 says
it is considered by many of the modern
Egyptians wrong to kill cats or to ill-
treat them (Α110. Eg. iii. p. 44). Dogs
they now count unclean.

Herodotus mentions thc eel and a scaly
fish of the Nile which he calls λεπιδωτὺς
as held sacred by the Egyptians. A still
inore general object of reverence was the
oxyrhy nehus (mentioned below on v. 35),
which gave its name to a town between
Memphis and Thebes. According to Plu-
tarch (Is. et Os. c. 7) the priests abstained
from fish of every kind. He also says the
people of Syene do not eat the Phagrus
(ecl), because it comes when the Nile over-
fiows, and so is the messenger of good
tidings. The town Phagriopolis in the
Delta was called after this fish. Strabo
(p. 812) mentions the Latus as worshipped
at a town near Thebes which the Greeks
called after it Latopolis. Another fish
called the Maeotes was worshipped at Ele-
phantine according to Clemens Alexandri·
nus (Orat. Adhort. p. 17, referred to by
WVilkinson, Anc. Eg. ii. 253, 21111 Series).
Small mummy fish have been found in
tombs according to the Arabian traveller
(of the 12th century) Abdallatif (Long’s
Egyptian Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 165), wbo
also found skeletons of dogs, which Hero-
dotus says were buried in sacred tombs in
the various cities of Egypt (ii. 67). Dog
munnnies have been found, and there isa
head of 0110 in the British Museum. A
dog's head was generally said to be the
symbol of Anubis (S. vi. 534, n.), who was
particularly worshipped at Cynopolis, the
town of Dogs, between Thebes and Mem-
phis. But Wilkinson denies this (Ano.
