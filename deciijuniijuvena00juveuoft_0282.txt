D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Clausit et egregias Lateranorum obsidet aedes
Tota cohors : rarus venit in coenacula miles.
Pauca licet portes argenti vaseula puri,

Nocte iter ingressus gladium contumque timebis

20

Et motae ad lunam trepidabis arundinis umbram z
Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.

Prima fere vota et cunctis notissima templis
Divitiae, crescant ut opes, ut maxima toto

Nostra sit arca foro.

Sed nulla aconita bibuntur

knew his enemies were successfully con-
spiring against him (Tac. Ann. xiv. 53, 54).
Within four years of Nero’s accession he
was said 10 have amassed “ ter millies ses-
tertium '' (Ann. xiii. 42), 300,000 ses-
tertia, which is more than two and a half
million sterling. He was returning from
Campania and had stopped at his villa
four miles from Rome when Gavius Silanus,
tribune of the praetorian cohort, was sent
by Nero to obtain his answer 1ο the charge
on which his life depended. The tribune
entered while Seneca was at dinner with
his wife and two friends, having first placed
a guard round the house (Ann. xv. 60),
which Juvenal here refers to. Plautius
Lateranus, like Seneca, was put to death as
a party to Piso's conspiracy against Nero.
He was consul designatus, He had been
condemned to death and pardoned, but de-
graded from the Senate by Claudius for an
intrigue with Messalina. Nero had re-
stored him to his rank (S. viii. 147). Ju-
venal applies to all three what only belongs
properly to Seneca. Nothing at any rate is
said elsewhere about the houses of the other
two being surrounded with soldiers, who,
he sayS, are seldom sent to ‘ coenacula' (S.
iii. 166, 268, 11.). The Laterani had a pa-
lace on Mons Coelius, the name if not the
site of which is preserved in the Lateran.
19. aryente' vascula φανὴ] This is re-
peated from ix. 141. ‘ Argentum purum ¹
is silver without any figures or chasing.
Τ herefore Cicero says the Haluntini, after
Verres had taken off all the ornamental
work from their vessels which were then
returned to them, “excussis deliciis cum
argento puro domum revert untur'’ (In Verr.
ii. 4. 23 z see also c. 22, and Long's note).
Riches, be they ever so small, keep a man
in fear of his life: if 0118 goes abroad with
but a small cup or two he is afraid of ‘the

robber’s sword and pike, and trembles at
the shadow of every reed that moves in the
moonlight, while the traveller whose hands
and purse are empty sings carelessly in the
very face of the robber. [In v. 20 Jahn
and Ribbeck have ‘ umbras.']

23. Primafere vota] “The first and most
familiar prayers in all the temples are for
money, that our wealth may grow and ours
may be the largest 811851 111 all the forum.''
He is not talking about the love of power,
but the love of money. ⁴ Opes' therefore
here is simply wealth. Ruperti and Mr.
Mayor distinguish them, quoting Cicero
(de Am. 8. 6); “Expetuntur divitiae ut
utare, opes ut colaris, honores ut laude-
ris.'' ‘Ut maxima toto nostra sit arca
foro ³ means that each wishes to have the
largest balance in his banker's hands. The
‘argentarii ' carried on their business in the
forum. Those who had considerable depo-
sits with them, it appears, had each their
own cash-box.

27. Setinum] See above, S. v. 34, n.
‘ Ardebit ² applies to the brightness of the
wine, not its spirit, as Mr. Mayor says. It
corresponds to φλέγειν (Heinrich).

28. Jamne igitur laudas,] “ Do you not
after this think it well that of the sages
one‚'' &e The laugher was Democritus of
Abdera ; the weeper, Heracleitus. Con-
cerning the former, who flourished at the
beginning of the fifth century 13.c.‚ see
notes on Hor. Epp. i. 12. 12; ii. 1. 194:
‘¹ Si foret in terris rideret Democritus.”
Heracleitus flourished a little before Demo-
8111115, at Ephesus. ‘¹ He is represented as
being of a gloomy and melancholy tem-
perament, which seems to have been the
source of 1118 bitter censures he passed
upon the most illustrious of his fellow-citi-
zens, and of his contempt generally for the
business and pursuits of men⁷' (Ritter's
