2. Crocodilon adorat] Herodotus (ii.
69) mentions particularly the people of
Thebes and those who lived near the lake
Moeris as worshippers of the crocodile,
while the people of the island Elephantine
(near Syene) did not think it sacred, and
even ave the flesh. The town which after
the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus bore the
name Arsinoe, in ancient times was called
the city of crocodiles. It was situated be·
tween the lake Moeris and the Nile. Strabo
(p. 811) speaks of a crocodile kept by the
priests in a pond near this place. The
animal was worshipped at Coptos (28) and
at Ombi (35). Herodotus describes the
ibis (ii. e. 75, 76), and he says the
Egyptians honoured it because it destroyed
the flying snakes that carne over from Ara-
bia, and it came to be generally believed
that this bird fed upon snakes. Cicero
says so (de Nat. Deor. i. 36) : “ibes maxi-
mam vim serpentium eonficiunt; volucres
angues ex vastitate Libyae vento Africo
invectas interficiunt atque consumunt.”
But the ibis is not capable of eating
snakes, and this is as fabulous as the
winged snakes themselves. It is supposed
the Egyptians reverenced this bird because
it came to the country about the time of
the rising of the Nile. It was not anative
of Egypt. There are mummies of the ibis,
and it is very common on Egyptian monu-
ments. It is identified with a bird now
called by the Arabs Abou—Hannes (Father
John), perhaps because it arrives about St.
John’s day. Cuvier describes it as about
the size of a hen ; in other respects his
description is not materially different from
that of the second sort mentioned by Hero—
dotus. Its worship was universal in

t. Cuvier has shown that the ibis is
not the Tantalus of- Linnaeus as Ruperti
says it is.

4. cercopitheci] The cynocephalus or
dog-headed ape was sacred to Thoth the
god of letters, whom the Greeks identified
with Hermes. He was worshipped in par-
ticular at Hermopolis in Middle Egypt.

The cercopithecus was a long-tailed ape
(κέρκος, πίθηκος), aud such have been found
embalmed.

5. Dimidio vnayicae resonant] The most
remarkable remains of Thebes on the west-
ern side of the Nile arc two scated colossal
figures. One is covered with ancient in-
scriptions cut by visitors, which show it to
be the famous statue of Memnon, from
which it was believed that sounds proceeded
at the rising of the sun produced by the
iinpression of his rays. Strabo (p. 816)
mentions them, but says that part of one
had fallen owing to an earthquake, and
that from the part that remained in its
place a sound such as might proceed from
a blow was heard once a day. He himself
heard it, but where it came from he pro-
fesses to be ignorant, but he is not inclined
to believe it issued from the stone. Pau-
sanias, who visited the statue, found it
broken as Strabo described it, and says it
was supposed to have been broken by Cam-
byscS. He compares the sound to the
snapping of a harp-string (i. 42. 3). Strabo
wrote during the life of our Saviour, Pausa-
nias at least a hundred and fifty years
after Strabo. Juvenal may have seen the
statue about half a century before Pausa-
nias. In his time, however, the statue
which has since been restored was muti-
lated, which is the meaning of ‘ dimidio,'
as below v. 56, “mltus Dimidios? and
viii. 4, “Curios jam diinidios.’' ‘Mag-icae
chordae ' implies that Pausanias described
the sound according to popular notions.
It is generally supposed to have been a
trick of the priests executed by some sim-
ple mechanical contrivance. The statue
supposed to be that of Memnon sho'ws evi-
dent marks of having been restored, the
body from the waist upwards being of
several pieces and of a different stone from
the legs and pedestal, which arc a monolith.
When this restoration took place is un-
known. It is attributed by Heeren to
Septimius Severus, who restored some of
the Egyptian monuments. His reign was
