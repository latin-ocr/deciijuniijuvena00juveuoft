SATIRA 111.

Viscera magnarum domuum dominique futuri.
Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo

Promptus et Isaeo torrentior.
Esse putes? quem vis hominem secum attulit. ad nos :

Ede quid illum

Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes,

Augur, schoenobates, medicus, magus : omnia novit.
Graeculus esuriens in caelum jusseris ibit.

Ad summam, non Maurus erat neque Sarmata nec Thrax

Qui sumpsit pennas, mediis sed natus Athenis.

Horum ego non fugiam conchylia ἶ) me prior illc
Signabit? fultusque toro meliore recumbet
Advectus Romam quo pruna et cottona vento?

72. Viscera magnarum domuum] ‘Do-
mus' has its dative and ablativc singular,
and genitive and accusative plural, of the
second or fourth declension. The other
cases are of the fourth. See Servius onVirgil,
Aen. ii. 445: “ Turres ac tecta domorum.”

74. Isaeo torrentior] This Isaens was a
rhetorician of great eminence who lived in
J uvenal’s time. Pliny the Younger (Epp.
ii. 3) says of him, “Summa est facultas,
copia, ubertas‚'' that he always spoke ex-
tempore, but just as if hc had written his
speechae; with much more in the highest
strain of praise. ‘ Torrens’ is repeated in
the same connexion in S. x. 9 and 128. It

ξ l5il)‹e Horace’s description of Pindar (C. iv.

“ Monte decurrens velut amnis imbres
Quem super notas aluere ripas

Fervet immensusque ruit profundo
Pindarus ore.'’

Ede quid illum] ‘ Come tell us what
you think-he is (that is, what is his par-
ticular accomplishment). Why, he is every
thing or any thing you please.’ Heinrich
reads, on his own conjecture, ‘esse jubes!
But the evidence of all the MSS. is in fa-
vour of ‘ putes.¹ Heinrich says the indica-
tive is wanted aster ‘ede‚' as below (v. 296),
‘ede-in qua te quaero proseucha ς’ but he
leaves out ‘ ubi consistas‚' which corre-
sponds more nearly to this place. ‘Quaero’
does not depend on ‘ ede.' By ‘ illum ' is
plainly meant any one of these Greeks.
They were ready to open schools for gram-
mar or rhetoric or geometry or drawing
or wrestling ; to tell the will of heaven or
to dance upon the tight-ropc; to administer
medicines or charms, it was all the same
to them. It must be remembered that the
Grammatici and Rhetorici, or teachers of

grammar and rhetoric, were mostly fo-
reigners and freedmcn. These subjects
formed the regular teaching of a Roman
boy, till he put on the ‘ toga virilis,' and
rhetoric he continued afterwards ‘Aliptes ’
seems to mean ‘ a trainer,’ the name being
taken from the ‘ceroma ' with which the
wrestlers were greased (v. 68). The Latin
for ‘ schoenobates ' was ‘ funambulus.’
These persons were very expert. (See
below, xiv. 266, and Dict. Ant.) The
professional physicians at Rome were
chiefly Greeks ς the first, according to
Pliny, having been one Archagathus, a
Peloponnesian, who arrived in Rome A.U.c. ’
535. But the chief ‘ medici ' were either
slaves or freedmcn living in families.

78. Graeculus esuriens] ‘The starve-
ling Greek, bid him fly up to the skies and
he'll do it ' (or try). This seems to have
been a proverbial way of speaking. Horace
says, “Caelum ipsum petimus stultitia ''
(C. i. 3. 38). Juvenal adda ‘ In short (if
you doubt me), it was no other than a Greek,
born in the heart of Athens, who put on
wings and flew.' Daedalus was generally
reputed to have been an Athenian. ‘ J us-
seris ' is ‘ suppose you bid him,' on which
construction, see Key's L. G. 1227 b, and
note on Hor. S. i. 1. 45. Johnson has
given this verse a turn which changes its
meaning, and is not saved by fidelity from
the charge of coarseness.

80. [Ribbeck has ‘ pinnas.']

81. suffiam conchylia ?] Their fine
clothes dyed with purple, the juice of the
shell-fish purpura and murex. Pei-sons of
most consideration would naturally sign
wills and so forth as witnesses before their
iuferiors, and lie upon handsomc sofas with
fine coverings (‘ stragulae vestes? See Hor.
S. ii. 3. 118, n. .

83. quo prunlz et cottona vento ?] Pliny
