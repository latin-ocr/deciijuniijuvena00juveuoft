D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Carpento rapitur pinguis Lateranus, et ipsc,
Ipse rotam adstringit multo sufflamine Consul ;
Nocte quidem, sed luna videt, sed sidera testes

Intendunt oeulos.

Finitum tempus honoris

Quum fuerit, clara Lateranus luce flagellum
Sumct et occursum nunquam trepidabit amici

J am senis, ac virga prior annuet atque maniplos
Solvet et infundet jumentis hordea lassis.

Interea dum lanatas torvumque juvencum

More Numae caedit J ovis ante altaria, jurat
Solam Eponam et facies olida ad praesepia pictas.

his whcel with his own hands. ‘ sufflamen ³
is a drag to lock the wheel. The word is
used in a derived sense in S. xvi. 50. The
only other place where it occurs is an in-
scription quoted by Forcellini. The verbal
adjective ‘ sufflaminandus' is used by Se-
neca, also in a metaphorica] sense (Contr.
iv. Praefat.). No doubt the word was in
common use, and the note of F. Didot
quoted by Ruperti, that perhaps Juvenal
coined it from ‘ sub ' and ‘ flare,' from
whence the French made their ‘ souffler,'
and that it represents very satirically and
well the panting and blowiug of the man
as he locked the wheel, is ridiculous.

147. pinfflcis Lateranus,] Most MSS.
have here aud in 151 Damasippus. The
Scholiast had Lateranus, which is also in
P. Damasippus is mentioned as a variant
by the Scholiast on V. 167. Lateranus was
a cognomen of the Claudia gens, of the
Sextia, and Plautia (see Dict. Biog.). J u-
venal speaks of ‘ egregias Lateranorum
aedes ² below (x. 17). Damasippus is the
only reading in v. 185, where a different
person is referred to.

153. Jam senis,] ‘Jam' is only em-
phatic, like ἥδη. The coachman is not
ashamed to meet his friend, though quite
an old man, whom he ought to have blushed
to meet. He recognizes him first and sa-
lutes him with his whip, as we see drivers
do now, turning up the butt end as they
pass an acquaintance. Dion Cassius (77.
10) says of the Emperor Caracalla, who was
given, among his idle and profligate habits,
to driving, προσεκύνει αὐτοὺς κάτωθεν τῇ
μάστιγι, meaning by αὐτούς the specta-
tors. Like J uvenal's ex-eonsul, he was not
ashamed to drive ‘clara luce :’ καὶ ἔλεγε
κατὰ τὸν ἥλιον τῇ ἅρματηλασίᾳ χρῆσθαι
καὶ ἐσεμνύνετο ἐπ’ αὐτῇ. ‘Maniplos’ are

the hands of hay. He goes through all the
dirty work of a groom.

155. Interea dum lanatas] All this
time whenever he goes to offer sacrifice to
Jove, he only swears by Epona, the mule-
drivcrs' goddess, the Scholiast says, and
other divinities patronized and invented by
the same sort of people, who hung daubs
of them about the stableS. Plutarch says
Epona was the offspring of a man and a
mare, and that she looked after horses (Pa-
rall. Graec. et Rom. c. 29). ‘More Numae'
is ‘ after the institution of Numa 3' not ‘like
a pious man,' as Ruperti says: nor is it ne-
cessary to suppose, as some persons do (so
Achaintre says, and Ruperti quotes him
again without correction or remark), that
Juvenal means satirieally to touch Numa
because he was a hypocrite, as the Chris-
tian writers describe him. Lipsius (Epist.
Quaest. ii. 9) supposes Juvenal had in his
eye the oath of Phidippides and his father’s
answer, in Aristophanes (Nubes 83) z

νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ τουτονὶ τὸν ἵππιον.
Μή ’μοί ’γε τοῦτον μηδαμῶς τὸν ἵππιον.

The Scholiast gives an outlandish word,
‘ robum,' for ‘ torvum ' in 155, and explains
it ‘robustunn rufum? Jahn [and Rib-
beck] adopt it ; and Mr. Mayor says “the
word is arehaie (more IVumae).”

158. Sed quum pervigiles] ‘ But when
he chooses to visit the eating-houses,’
which are called ‘ pervigiles ’ because they
were kept open all night for the benefit of
such people. Horace has in the same sense
gqgges 11116ρέ1135 Ρέἔΐετ 1111 1110911ιὲ (Ogglii.
