early death, but nge much worse than death. The steps ure these. Money is bor-
rowed first and spent nt Rome ; but when the usui-er begins to trouble them, then
off they go to some nice country town. To run away from the forum is no worse
than froin Suburrn to migrate to Esquiliae ε they only care that they must 1058 the
games: they never think of blushing: Modesty is laughed at as she flies the town,
and few men care to stay her.

'. 56. T0·day‚ my friend, you'll see whether 1 practise what Ι preach, or praise plain
fure but call sor rich. You'll find in me Evander, you shall be Hercules or Aeneas,
Now listen to your dinner. A young kid froin my sarm, and wild roots gathered by
my gurdener's wife; fresh eggs warni in the nest, and heus that laid them ; grapes
fresh as when first plucked, the finest pears and appleS‚ the crude juice dried from
out them.

'. 77. Such was the (11111181 of our senators when first they grew luxurious. The herbs
he gathered in his little garden, such as a diteher now turns up his nose at, Curius
would boil with his own hand. The flitch hung up to dry in former times they kept
for holidnys, and lard for birthdays for their blood relations and part of the victim’s
meat. The great man who had thrice been consul, dictator too, went to such feasts
stalking along with spade upon his shoulder. Iu the strict Censor’s days no one
would ask what sort of turtles might be found in the sea, to ornament the rich man’s
couch : they were content with a rude ass's head. Their food and house and furni·
ture were plain alike.

V. 100. Unskilled in art, the cups they got for plunder the soldiers broke to ornament
their harness or their helmets. The only silver that they had adorned their arms.
Their homely fare was served in earthenware. If yon're inclined to envy, you might
envy those good times. The gods were nearer unto men ; they warned the city of
the Gauls’ approach, such care for Rome had Jupiter when made of clay. The tables
then were made of home-grown wood. But now the richest vinnds have no flavour
except on a round table with a carved ivory stem ς a silver oue to them is rude as an
11011 ring upon the finger.

V. 129. I'll have no guest then who despises povertys 1 have not an ounee of ivory in
all my house ; the very handles of my knives are boue ; and yet they do not spoil the
meat, or cut the worse for that. And I've no carver taught by first-rate artist, who
teaches them to cut up all fine dishes. My man's a novice too, and cannot filch
except in a small way, a chop or so. 1¹ve only a rough boy in woollen clothes to
offer you my vulgar herbs, no eastern bought for a vast price from dealers. VVhatever
you may ask for ask in Latin. They all are dressed alike, their hair eropped straight,
oombed out to-day in honour of my guest; boys from the farm, modest as those
should be who wear the purple, not trained to lewdness. One shall bring you wine
grown on his native hills. Look not for wauton dancing girls (such as your married
ladies gaze at with their husbands at their elbow) to tickle lust: though women care for
this more than the men. But this is not for humble houses. We leave the click of
metanetsand songs too lewd for brothels and all the tricks of lust for those who void
their rheum on marble floors. We make allowances for wealth, only the poor are
shamed by gambling and adultery: the rich who do such things are nierry gentle-
men. You'll find with me a different sort of sportis: we'll read what Homer wrote
and his peer Maro. It matters not what voice recites such verses.

V. 183. But come, put care away and take a rest. We’ll have no word of debts or
jaalon: thoughts; before my door you must put off all this, home and its troubles,
slaves and their breakuges, and worse than all the ingratitude of friends. Τ118 great
