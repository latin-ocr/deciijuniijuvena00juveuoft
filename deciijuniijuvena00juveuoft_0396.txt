D. JUNII JUVENALIS‘

Fingentem immanes Laestrygonas atque Cyclopas ’ἓ
Nam citius Scyllam vel concurrentia saxa

Cyanea, plenos et tempestatilms utres

Crediderim, aut tenui percussum verbere Circes

Et eum remigibus grunnisse Elpenora porcis.

Tam vacui capitis populum Phaeaca putavit ?''

Sic aliquis merito nondum ebrius et minimum qui

De Corcyraea temetum duxerat urna 3

Moretum, v. 95, there is “Spargit humi
atque abicit.'' Lachmann quotes from the
Medea of Seneca, v. 257 ι

“ ΗΞΞ adice, Colchos, adjce (adiice) Aeeten
ucem‚'

where the second syllable is long and short
in the same verse. The compounds os
‘ iacio ' were not always written ‘ iicio‚' for
in Lucretius we have “ eiecit omnes,'' where
‘ eiecit’ is the present ς and Lachmann
refers to the Lex Servilia of Glaucia (ed.
Klenze, p. 62), where there is “ quo iou-
dices sorticolas conieciant.'' It appears
however from Gellius (iv. 17) that it be-
came common to omit one of the 2⁴5 in such
words as ‘ obiiciehatss and it was supposed
that ‘ ob ' became a long syllable; but
Gellius explains that such words as ‘ obii-
cere‚’ ‘ coniicere,' are properly written with
ii, for they are formed fr0m ‘iacio,' and
the a is changed into i in the compound
verbs. He correctly remarks that the
firsti in ii has the force of a consonant.
‘ Obicibus ruptis ' (Virg. Georg. 2. 480), as
it appears, was also sometimes written in
the time of Gellius, but hc remarks that
the complete form is ‘ Obiicibus? The
form ‘ abicit ³ in this passage is irregular,
but it is not the only example, as we have
seen.] Ulysses iu the course of his story
tells how Circe described Scylla and Cha-
rybdis to him (xii. 73, sqq.). The Laestry-
gonian cannibals he speaks of inv x. 81, sqq.
They were claimed by the inhabitants of
Formiae as their ancestors (Hor. C. iii. 16.
34, n., and Introd. to iii. 17).

19. Nam citius Scyllam] The speaker
says he might perhaps more readily swal-
low his stoi-ies about the rocks and the
winds and his erew turned to pig-s, though
these are mere lies (as he implies inv. 17).
But did he think the I'haeacians such
fools as to believe about the giants that
ate nien Ρ

230. Cyanam] This is an emendation of

Dausqueius (on Silius xiv. 515) upon the
common reading ‘ Cyanes? Heinrich adopts
it, and I (lo so without much confidence.
If it is right, the caesura and two conso-
nants following will account for the ‘a'
being long. Ruperti has adopted ‘ Cyaneas ’
from one MS. commonly appealed to by
R. Stephens, but there is reason to think
the readings were sometimes his own. P.
has ‘ Cyaneis‚' and some others. Jahn,
Hermann, [and Ribbeck] have that form,
and Mr. Mayor says it is the ablative of
place, which would require us to translate
it “ the clashing rocks in Cyaneae,” which
has no meaning. Cyaneis is only another
form of Cyanes, the accusative. But that
is corrupt. The rocks Juvenal means are
the Symplegades at the entrance of the
Thracian Bosporus from the Euxine, to
which the epithet κυάνεαι was commonly
applied (Eurip. Med. 2). The Scholiast
asks quietly “numquid ad haec Ulixes ac-
cessit ?” But Juvenal has confounded
these with other rocks in the Sicilian Sea,
which Circe advised Ulysses to avoid.
Homer (OdysS. xii. 61) calls them Πλαγκ-
wi, ‘ the Wanderers‚' for the same reason
that the others are called Συμπληγάδες,
‘ concurrentia saxa.’ then Ulysses was
leaving the island of Aeolus, the king gave
him a lcathern bag containing all the
winds. His companions let them out of
the bag, and the consequences were dis-
astrous (x. 19, 46). Elpenor was one of
Ulysses’ companions, whom Circe turned
with a stroke of her light rod (‘ tenui ver-
bere ') into swine.

25. De Corcyraea temetum] The Phae-
acia of Homer, which is a fabulous place,
was identified in after times with Corcyra.
‘ Temetum ³ is an old word for wine. Ho-
race uses it, Epp. ii. 2. 163, where see
note and see Porcellini. As to ‘ urna’ see
vi. 426, n. ‘ Minimum ' is used adverbially,
‘ minimum duxerat‚’ as “ Et multum lacri-

mas verba inter singula fudit‚” Aen. iii.
348 (Heinecke, Obs. p. 105).
