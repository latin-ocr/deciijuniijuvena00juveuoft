SATI RA X. 2:39
Egregios equites et castra ‹loun-stiva. Quidni 95
llaec cupias? et qui nolunt occidere quenquam
Posse volunt. Sed quae praeclara et prospera tantum
Ut rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum Ρ
Hujus qui trahitur praetextam sumere mavis,
An Fidenarum Gabiorumque csse. potestas lto

Et de mensura jus dicere, vasa minora.
Frangere pannosus vacuis Aedilis Ulubris? x
Ergo quid optandum soret ignorasse fateris
Sejanum: nam qui nimios optabat honores

ligentior, quippe addictus mathematicae
plenusque persuasionis cuncta fato agi '' (c.
69). Superstition and vice grew upon him
together ; a common case.

— Vis certe pila, cohortes] He says, no
doubt yon like promotimx, and why should
you not? Men who have no mind to kill
their fellows like to have the power to do
so. He takes different grades of military
rank to illustrate his meaning, which is
that the desire for promotion is universal
and natural, and yet when the highest
rank is gained what does it lead to? The
steps he takes are ‘primipilus eenturio,'
‘ praefectus cohorti‚’ ⁴ eques egregius: and
‘praefectus praetorio? As late as the time
of Polybius the infantry of a Roman legion
were formed into three bodies, ‘hastatis
‘ principes‚’ and ‘triarii ' or ‘pilani,' as
they were sometimes called, because they
carried a pilum or short javelin. Each of
these divisions was subdivided into ‘ mani-
puli‚' and the centurion of the first ‘ mani-
pulns' of the ‘triarii,' who were veteran
tmops, was called ‘primipilus’ See xiv.
197: “ Ut locupletem aquilam tibi sexage-
simus annus Afl'erat.'' ⁶ Pila ' here stands
for ‘ primipili ’ (see Forcellini). In antl after
the time of caesar the legion was divided
into ten eohortS, each of which consisted of
three ‘manipuli.' The commander of a co-
hort was ‘ praefectus? ⁴ Equites egregii ’are
explained by Lipsius on Tac. Ann. xi. 4.
The distinction, he says, was confined under
the republic to such ‘ equites ' as were re-
markable for their birth, wealth, or cha-
racter. But Augustus formed a separate
class of those who had the fortune of a
senator, or were entitled by their position
to hope for the Senate, and these he al-
lowed to wear the ‘latus clavus ’ or broad
stripe on the tunic (which was the mark
of senatorial rank). Tacitus calls them
· illustres ’ (Anu. ii. 59; xi. 4), and
“equites Romani dignitate senatoria ''
(xvi. 17) ; and he opposes to them “ modici

equites Romani '' (i. 73). Cicero speaks
in a general way of ‘⁴ equites Romani
non obscuri neque ignoti, sed honesti et
illustres ’¹ (In Verr. ii. 3. 24). By ‘do-
mestica castra ' he means the command of
the ‘praetoria eohors’ (see S. i. 58, n.).
These troops were quartered in various
parts of the city till Sejanus had command
of them, when they were all placed in per-
manent quarters near the Agger of Servius
Tullius. See note on S. v. 153.

97. Sed quae praeclara] “ But what are
great distinctions and high prosperity if wo
hold them only on the understanding that
the measure of our sufferings is propor-
tioned to our success ?'’ The reading of
most MSS. and some of the best is ‘ tan·
tum ;’ P. has ‘ tanti,' which nearly all the
editors have adopted, except Heinrich. 1
prefer ‘ tantum?

100.AnFidenarum Gabiorumque] These
towns have been associated before, vi. 56.
See also note on iii. 192: “Simplicibus
Gabiis.” Ulubrae Horace mentions as a
small unimportant town (Epp. i. 11. 30) :
‘⁴ Quod petis hic est, Est Ulubris, animus
si te non deficit aequuS.'’ It was in La-
tium. ‘ Potestas ¹ is the modern ‘podestaf
‘ Vacuis’ is ‘empty‚’ ‘ unfrequented‚’ as in
S. iii. 2: “Laudo tamen vacuis quod sedem
figere Cumis? As to the mnnieipal aediles
see S. iii. 179. They were police magis-
trates, and looked after the market. On
great occasions, he says a white tunic was
a dress good enough for them3 here he
speaks of them in rags. Persius refers to
the country aediles just in the same way
(i. 129, 130): “ Sese aliquem credens, Italo
quod honore supinus F regerit heminas
Arreti aedilis iniquas.’'

103. Eryo quid oplandum] ‘ Ergo ' car-
ries us back to v. 54, where the general
assertion is made of which Sejanus was a
notable illustration. ‘ignorasse fateris'
implies that the answer is that which good
sense suggests.
