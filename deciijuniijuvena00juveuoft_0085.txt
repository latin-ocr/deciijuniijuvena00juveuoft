SATIRA ΙΙ.

Et curare eutem : summi constantia civis

Bebriaci campo spolium affectare Palati,

Et pressum in facie digitis extendere panem :
Quod nec in Assyrio pharetrata Semiramis orbe,
Moesta nec Actiaca fecit Cleopatra carina.

Hic nullus verbis pudor aut reverentia mensac;

Hie turpis Cybeles et fracta voce loquendi

right Ι think in his notion of its meaning.
He says in these lines “ we havc the
original of the mock heroic so much ad-
inired in the Rape of the Lock :''

“ Whether the nymph shall break Diana's
Or sciffig’frail china jar receives a flaw ;
Or stain her honour or-—her new bro-
Ἐοτςὲἲάὴοὲι· prayersor miss—a masque·
Or losstlxeer beart or—necklace at a ball.’'

This sense is given in the Argument. Sue-
tonius (l. c.) says: “Quin et faciem quotidie
rasitare, ac pane madido linere consuetum,
idque instituisse a prima lanugine ne bar-
batus unquam esset.'' Horace speaks of
the Phaeacians as “In cute curanda plus
aequo operata juventus ’' (Epp. i. 2. 29),
and of himself as “pinguem et nitidum
bene curata cute ” (Epp. i. 4. 15).

106. Bebriaci campo] Otho was pro-
claimed emperor in Rome on the 15th of
January, ΑΔ). 69, and in March following
he led an army into Cisalpine Gallia against
Vitellius, and in less than a month his
troops were defeated with immense loss
about twenty miles from a smalltown called
Bebriacum, or Bedriacum, which lay be-
tween Verona and Cremona. He imme-
diately afterwards destroyed himself. Al-
though the battle was fou'ght so far from
Bebriacum, it got its name from that town,
owing to Otho’s army being encamped there
before the battle and pursued thither after
it. All the MSS. of Juvenal are in favour
of Bebriaeum ς those of Tacitus are divided.
Τὶιε form that the editors adopt is Bedria-
cum; Ruperti does so, though in this place
he has the ‘b‚’ and according to him the
greatest number of MSS. have the same
in Tacitus. (See Rup. on Tac. Hist. i.

1)08. Quod nec in Assyrio] Semiramis,
the mythical queen and joint founder of
Nineveh, was reported to be as voluptuous
as she was great and brave. See Ovid. Am.
i. 5. 11: “Qualiter in thalamos formosa
Semiramis isse Dicitur et multis Lais amata

viris.” The Assyrian world represented in
its day what the Roman world did after·
wards, all the civilization of the earth.
[Ribbeck omits vv. 108, 109.]

109. Moesta nec Aeliae-a] The battle of
Actium was fought B.c. 31, and Cleopatra's
fleet fied before the battle began. Horace
(C. i. 37. 16) represents Augustus pursuing
her

‘¹ ——ab Italia volantem,
Remis adurgenS, accipiter velut
Molles columbas——

——quae generosius
Perire quaerens uec muliebriter
Expavit eusem,'’ διο.

Heinrich thinks the reading should be
‘ moecha,’ and that the monks altered it to
‘moesta.’ All the MSS. have ‘moesta.'
Sec iii. 108, n.

110. Hic nullus verbis pudor] He goes
back aster the digression about Otho to the
scene at the mock rites of Fauna. They
had no shame as to what they said, nor any
regard for the decorum of the table, in
respect to which Grangaeus quotes Syne-
sius, Epist. 57, τράπεζα μὲν ἱερὸν χρῆμα
δι’ ἧς ὁ θεὸς τιμᾶται φίλιός τε καὶ ξένιος,
and Claudian (in Ruffin. i. 228), “J urata
Deorum Majestas teritur, nunquam reve-
rentia mensae,” which seems to be copied
from Juvenal. The daily offering to the
Lares at the principal meal gave it in theory
a sacred character 3 and on the same prin·
ciple Horace says (C. iv. 15. 25, sqq.):

“Nosque et profestis lucibus et sacris
Inter jocosi munera Liberi
Cum prole matronisque nostris,
Rite deos prius apprecati,
Virtute functos more patrum duces
(canemus).’'

111. Hic turpis Cybeles] If this be
the true reading ‘ Cybeles ' and ‘loquendi ’
must both depeud ou ‘turpis libertas3’
‘Cybele’s foul licenee and the liberty to
speak iu feeble voice? One MS. has ‘turpis
Cybele est! I do not think that mends
the matter much. T he worship of Cybele
or Rhea, the mother of the gods, as she is
