D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Tuccia vesicae non imperat ς Appula gannit

Sicut in amplexu3 subitum et miserabile longum

Attendit Thymclc; Thymele tunc rustica discit.
Ast aliae, quoties aulaea recondita cessant

Et vacuo clausoque sonant fora sola theatro
Atque a plebeiis longe Megalesia, tristes

Personam thyrsumque tenent et subligar Acci.

lascivious Bathyllus danccd the pantomimic
Leda.'’ We had the participle χειρονομῶν
above (S. v. 121). This is the adjective
χειρονόμος. The Latin phrases for dancing
were mostly taken from the motion of the
armS, as ‘ brachia jactare, deducere, ducere,
dare, mittere, moverc,' &c. See Hor.
C. ii. 12. 20, n. Ovid (Rem. Am. 334)
comes still nearer the Greek word: “ Fac
saltet, nescit si qua movere manum.'’ And
(Met. xiv. 520) : “In numerum motis ma-
nibus duxere choreas.’' The ‘ pantomimus '
Bathyllus, the freedman of Maecenas, and
one of the most celebrated dancers of his
day, is here put for any dancer (see Hor.
Epod. xiv. 9, n.). Horace uses ‘saltare'
in a transitive way ε “Pastorem saltaret uti
Cyclopa rogabat '' (S. i. 5. 63, n.).

66. Attendic Thymele ;] This passage
has caused a great deal of trouble. It may
be corrupt. The general sense seems to
be that while the actor is expressing sudden
emotions, and sighing, the girl from the
country is eagerly and long watching him,
and learns to imitate what she sees. P. has
‘ subito,’ which Jahn couples with ‘ain-
plexu.' [Ribbeck has the line pointed
thus:

‘Sicut in amplexu subitum et miserabile,
longum,’

which is perhaps betten] Thymele is the
name of an actress mentioned in i. 36.
But this is a country girl. Gifl'ord has a
useful note here on the ‘ pantomimi? The
extreme wantonness of the Roman basset,
as Juvenal describes it, was of later growth
than Bathyllus' day. He and Pylades appear
to have improved greatly on the old mimes‚
and to have given grace to dancing.

67. aulaea recondita cessant] When
theatres are slmt up and cease. ‘Aulaea' was
the curtain, similar to ours, except that it
was raised from below the stage instead of
being let down from above (see note on
Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 189 : ‘⁶' Quattuor aut plures
aulaea premuntur in horas ’'). ‘ Aulaea'
is here put for the theatre. The ‘ludi

plebeii ' was a festival instituted perhaps after
the secession of the ‘ plebs ' to Mons Sacer
(A.U.C. 260). It was held in the middle
of November, and the Megalesia or games
of Cybele (see above S. ii. 111, 11.) took
place in April. It appears there were no
plays acted during these five months ; and
the only noise, Juvenal says, was heard in
the fora, where actors ranted on a different
sta e.

7go. Personam thyrsumque] The ladies
are dull in this long interval, and amuse
themselves with private theatricals, wherein
they put on the mask themselves, and
flourish the thyrsus like the Bacchantes on
the stage, and wear the aetor's drawers.
‘ Subligar' is another form of ‘ subligacu-
lum‚' drawers‚ or something worn for de-
cency under the tunic. Cicero (de Off. i.
35) says, “ Scenicorum mos tantam habet a
vetere disciplina verecundiam ut in scenam
sine subligaculo prodeat neme, verentur
enim ne, si quo casu evenerit ut corporis
partes quaedam aperiantur, adspiciantur
11011 decore.” Tacitus mentions how Nero
established a private theatre, at which
young men and women of good family
acted, and which encouraged the lowest
depravity among them (Anu. xiv. 15). Who
Accius may have been is unknown. He was
a player. The Seholiast has this note,
“Subliyar Arne.- vestem tragoedi ;'’ and
Jahn accordingly edits ‘subligar acne‚’
which is in P. But these amateurs did
not get up tragedies. [Ribbeck has ‘ sub-
ligar Hagni.']

71. Urbicus exodio] Urbicus is the
name of a comic actor. Nothing more is
known of him. As to ‘exodium‚' see S. iii.
174, n. The Atellane plays were so named
from Atella, a town in Campania, in the
dialect of which part of Italy (the Oscan)
they were written. They were comedies
of five acts with a regular plot. They were
refined, it appears, compared with the
mimes or broad farces, which superseded
them in a great measure, but the ‘ exodia ’
between the acts seem to have supplied all
