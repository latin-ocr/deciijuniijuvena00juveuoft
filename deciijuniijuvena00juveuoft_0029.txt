LIFE OF JUVENA L. xxiii

institution of a hanghty people‚ but now obedient to the wantenness of
a tyrant who mocked its wcukness and pluycd with its servility‚ is
amusingly shown in the fourth Satire. '11¹⁰ fifth exposes a disti-rent
sort of servility, that of pan-amites, who sels *their indepeml1fnce and
accept contempt sor flie'sake osa meal grudgingly given, a low lum-tice
which'was more systematized at Rome, if it was not much more common,
than it is in our own country. The neglect of literary men has a Satire
to itself (the seventh); aristot-ratic pride has another (the eighth). The
cunning of will-hunters is hit off at the end of the twelsth‚ which is not
among the most interesting of these compositions. It relates chiefly to
the arrival of a friend after a dangerous voyage, and is more of the
nature ofa familiar letter than of a Satire. The dishonesty of the age
is described in the thirteenth Satire, which contains some of Juvenal’s
finest verseS, and shows him in the best character. This also is in the
form of an epistle to a friend, and so is the eleventh‚ which contains an
invitation to dinner, and contrasts the poet's own plainness of living with
the luxurious habits of his contemporaries. Thus Juvenal goes through all
the great scandals of his day, and treats them unsparingly. The crimes
and criminals of former reigns are freely introduced by way of illustra-
tion, but this is because the vices of one reign represented those of
another, and the names of the dead could be more safely used than of
the living. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all
brought up from time to time to point a moral or illustrate some aspect
of crime.

The most celebrated of ‚Juvenal’s poemS‚ the tenth, has more of the
declamatory character, which some of his critics attribute to all. It is
on the vanity of human wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historical
exampleS, and the poem has not much bearing upon the particular
character of his times. It is the finest specimen of that sort of com-
position that I am acquainted with. The fifteenth Satire is connected
with a scene of little general interest, an Egyptian squabble, Juvenal’s
own interest in which can only be accounted for by his having been in
the country where it happened. The last Satire, if it had been com-
pleted, would have furnished a sketch of military life, sarcastic but
good-humoured, from which a good deal of information might have been
derived.
