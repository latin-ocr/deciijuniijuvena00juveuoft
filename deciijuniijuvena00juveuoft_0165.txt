Tempestate paras, jamque a tonsore magistro
Pecteris et digito pignus fortasse dedisti.
Certe sanus eras ε uxorem, Postume, ducis?
Dic qua Tisiphone, quibus exagitare colubris?

Ferre potes dominam salvis tot restibus ullam,

Quum pateant altae caligantesque fenestrae,
Quum tibi vicinum se praebeat Aemilius pons?
Aut si de multis nullus placet exitus, illud
Nonne putas melius quod tecum pusio dormit,

Pusio qui noctu non litigat, exigit a te

tiele ‘obligationes ’ in Smith’s Dict. Ant.
Here the marriage contract is intended,
‘sponsalia' raepecting which see S. ii. 119,
iii. 111, and Dict. Ant„ Art. ‘Marriage.’
It seems from v. 27. that one of the cere-
monioe on that occasion was that of the
man putting a ring on the woman's finger,
which was the fourth of the left hand as
with us. See note on Hor. S. ii. 7. 9.
Juvenal says, in spite of the profligacy of
the age men still go on contracting mar—
“ . ‘A tonsore magistro Pecteris ’
means that the man gets his hair dressed
by a first-rate barber to show himself off
before his betrothed.

were once in your senses: are you now
going to marry Ρ What Fury has driven

hair of the Fui-iezi, as may be seen in au the
works of art representing them. ‘¹ Intorti
capillis Eumenidum recreantur angues ''
(Hor. C. ii. 13. 35). As to the ablative

on S. iii. 91.

30. Ferre potes dominam] ‘ Domina’
is used for a wife (see note on Hor. C. ii.
12. 13: “ me dulcis dominae musa Licym-
niae’') or a mistress. But here it means a
tymnt. He asks if Postumus can submit
to any woman-tyrant while there are ropes
in the world to hang himself with, or high
windows and bridges to thr-ow himself from.
Porcellini says the windows are called ‘cali-
gantem’ because they are so high they make
the eyes blind or dizzy to look down from
them. ‘Aemilius pons’ was a stone bridge
built by M. Aemilius Scaurus in his ceu-
sorship, ΔΑΜ). 645. It was the first bridge
aelon the Tiber going up the. river, and
was opposite to Mons Aventinus. It has

been consounded with Pons sublicius,
which was higher up.

34. quod tecum pusio domm] ‘ Pusio’
is the reading of the MSS. It is a little
boy, connected with ‘pusus,’ ‘pusillus,’ &c.
Cicero uses the word in the same filthy
connexion as here (pro Caelio, e. 15):
“tecum semper pusio cum majore sorore
eubitavit.’' Jahn [and Ribbeck] have
adopted Valla’s conjecture, ‘pugio‚' arising
out of the scholium, which he gives thus:
‘¹ PUNGIO afacto nomen.'' Remmius, Cra-
mer, Heinrich, have it ‘pusio’ in the Scho-
liast’s lemma ; but from his explanation
it does not seem as if he had that word.
Forcellini gives ‘pusio :' ‘pugio' has the
support of one Paris MS. of the tenth
centul-v.

35. Exigit a te] Jahn has ‘ exigit ex te‚'
with bad taste and against the MSS.

38. Sed placet Ursidio lea: Julia :] Ur-
sidius (Postu'mus) is satisfied with the
“lex Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus,'’ or
as it is otherwise called, “lex Julia et
Papia Poppaea‚” which was enacted about
A U.c. 736, and named aster Augustus. In
Ad). 9 it was amended, in the consulship of
M. Papius Mutilus and Q. Poppaeus Se-
cundus, and their names were added to it.
Horace calls it Lex Marita (C. S. 20).
Its object among other things was to pro-
mote marriage, with which view it imposed
penalties on those men who remained single
after a certain age. As to ‘tollere’ for
rearing children, see Horace, S. ii. 5. 46. n.:
“Validus male filius in re Praeclara sub—
latus aletur ;'’ where it is explained that
the word is used from the old practice of
fathers taking up in their arms at their
birth such of their children as they wished
