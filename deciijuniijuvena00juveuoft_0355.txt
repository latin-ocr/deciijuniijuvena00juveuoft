SATIRA XIII.

Et majore domus gemitu, majore tumultu
l'languntur nummi quam funera.

Nemo dolorem

Fingit in hoc casu, vestem diducere summam
Contentus, vexare oculos humore coacto.
Ploratur lacrimis amissa pecunia veris.

Sed si cuncta vides simili fora plena querela,

Si decies lectis diversa parte tabellis

Vana supervacui dicunt chirographa ligni,
Arguit ipsorum quos littera gemmaque princeps
Sardonychum, loculis quae custoditur eburnis,

Te nunc, delicias, extra communia censes
Qui tu gallinae filius albae,

his breast and his cheeks as much ns he
pleases, for when a great loss has been sus-
tained it is right to shut- up the house. The
loss of money, he continues is even more
loudly lamented than the loss of friends,
for the tears in the one case are real, iu the
other they may be forced. ⁴ Hoc’ (v. 132)
does not refer to the latter clause, but
to that which is most prominent in the
writer’s mind. See x. 326, and notes on
Hor. S. ii. 2. 29, 36. The reading ‘in
occasu’ iu several MSS. and editions, and
approved by Achaintre, is abominable.
Heinrich puts a full stop at ‘damno.’ In
that case ‘ et ' which follows must be con-
strued ‘even.’ He is not content to tear
only the top of his tunic instead of rending
it from top to bottom and to torment his
eyes with forced tears (crocodile’s tear-s).
‘ Deducere ’ has no meaning here. Hein-
rich considers v. 134 feeble, and that it
had better perhaps be away. Ι think he is
wron .

135g. Sed εἰ cuncta vides] ‘Sed' goes
back to v. 129, after what Heinrich calls
a Juvenal-like digression. ‘ Sed' is com-
monly used after digressions. See note on
Hor. S. i. 1. 27 : ‘⁴ Sed tamen amoto quae-
ramus seria ludo ’' (S. xv. 38, n.). As to
‘ cuncta fora ' see S. ii. 52, n.

136. Si decies lectis] This is a difficule
sentence. ‘Decies’ seems to be put for
any large number of times, and ‘diversa
parte ’ in different parts of the town. The
meaning then would be, “if it often hap-
pens, not here or there but in various places
(in all the fora), that debtors when their
acknowledgments are read over to them say
their bonds are void, and the tables they
are written upon are worthless, though their
own writing and their own choicest scal

conviet them, do you think you, my fine
geutleman, are to be placed beyond tho
common pale of suffering Ρ ” ‘ Chirographa’
aud ‘ syngraphae ’ were used in later times
as equivalent words for bonds, notes of
hand, or agreemeuts. In Cicero's time
‘ chirographa ’ had not this legal sense, but
See Long's note on

‘syngraphae' had.

wooden waxed tablets (tabellae) 011 which
they wrote. The very writing convicted
the man, his acknowledgment of the depo-
sit (Hor. S. ii. 3. 69, n.: “ scribe decem
Nerio ’'). It was scaled with his own seal,
the chief of gems, which he carried about
in a little ivory purse. As to ‘sardony-
chum’ see vi. 382, n. It is the genitive
plural. Most MSS. have ‘sardonicus’ or
‘sardonichus,’ or with a ‘y.' But that
form is not found elsewhere. P. has ‘ sar-
donichum,' and one Paris MS. of the 9th
century. As to ‘loculi ' see above, xi. 38,
n. As to ‘delicias ³ see vi. 47: “de-
lieias homiuis.” It is an ironical exclama-
tion. “ Perhaps however del. means rather
presumption '' (Mayor). How would he
translate it Ρ [‘Teno delicias ' Ρς. Jahn
and Ribbeck accordingly have ‘ten ο deli-
clas.'

Mi. Qui tu gallinae—filius albae,] 'I'he
eggs of a white hen, it appearS, were held in
higher estimation than others. Columella
says white hens do not lay often. The bird
must have been more or less rare, or tho
distinction would not have arisen. Not
much more to the purpose can be said
about it. ‘ Qui ¹ is ‘ how.' Most MSS.‚
followed by Jahn, Hermann, [and Rib-
beck,] have ‘ quia‚' which requires the (Ρ)
after ‘ponendum ’ to be removed. Hein-
rich proposes ‘ quid.’
