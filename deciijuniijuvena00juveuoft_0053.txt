SEMPER ego auditor tantum ⁸? nunquamne reponam

1. Semper eqo auditor tantum ?] See In-
troduetiou. In the time of Augustus it had
become common for all sorts of writers, but
particularly poem, to recite their productions
iu public places, baths, colonnades‚ and so
forth3 or to get their friends and acquaint—
ance together to hear them in private houses
or rooms hired for the purpose. The prac-
tice was adopted by literary men of character
as well as the inferior sort; the example
having been first set, as is said, by Asinius
Pouio, the friend and patron ofHorace and
others. Horace refers to it familiarly, and
many of the authorities are quoted on S. i.
4. ¹73. It was considered a nuisance in his
day ; and the last ot' his poems ends with a
stroke at those reciters :

“ Indoctum doctumque fugat recitator acer-
Quenli, ligioni-ripun tenet occiditque legendo,
Non missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hi·

rudo.” (Α. Ρ. fin.)

Pliny the younger, writing about the time of
this satire, speaks with a good deal of indul-
gence of the practice, and regi-ets that the
reciters are not encouraged by larger audi-
ences. He says he attended them all and
made friends with them (Epp. i. 13).

2. Theseide Codri 2²] The Seholiast writes
Cordi,and P. has the same. Servius on Virg.
xi. 458, aa well as all the other MSS„ lias
Codri. Cordus is a Roman name. Codrus
is used below, S. iii. 203. 208, and is so
written in the same MS„ except that a later
hand has introduced Cordus. Codrus is used
by Martial, ii. 57; v. 26, and by virgil, Ecl.
v.113; vii. 26. It isin every case, as here, a
fictitioua name ; though Servius on the latter
place says, “Codrus poeta ejusdem temporis
fuit ut Valgius in Elegis suis refert.'’ Cor-

of Horace’s Iarbitas (Epp. i. 19. 15). The
story of Theseus furnished subjects for epic
poenis and tragedies, and this may have been
either, probably an epic, as comedy‚ elegy‚
and tragedy come after.

3. Impune erqo mihi] ‘Impune’ reminds
us of Horace's “ Obturem patulas impune
legentibus aures'' (Epp. ii. 2. 105), and
“ nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor ’³
(Epp. i. 19. 39). He paid his friends in
their own coin. This is expressed in ‘repo-
nam,’ which means ‘to repay! Pliny, in the
epistle quoted above, has a good-humoured
sentence which illustratos this : “ Possum
jam repetere secessum et scribere aliquid
quod non recitem, ne videar quorum recitati-
onibus afl'ui non auditor fuisse sed creditor.
Nam ut ceteris in rebus ita in audiendiofficio
perit gratia si reposcatur.” ‘Togatae’ were
comedies with Roman plots and characters,
as opposed to ‘ palliatae,’ which were Grecian.
See Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 57, n.; and as to ‘ele-
gos' see A. P. 75, n. Heinrich adopts from
one MS. ‘cantaverit’ for ‘recitaverit‚'which
appears in every other MS. and edition.
Juvenal uses ‘cantat’ below, x. 178, and
might have used it here.

4. ingens Telephus] Telephus, king of
Mysia, was a son of Hercules, and a fertile
subject for tragedy. (See Hor. A. Ρ. 96, ιι.)
His strength is said to have approached that
of his father, and no doubt was magnifled
by the poets Juvenal refers to. ‘Ingens’
Ruperti, Heinrich, and others correctly refer
to the length of the poem ς others to the
prowess of the man.

5. summi plenajam margine libri] This
is meant to show the length of the poem.
The back of the papyrus, or parchment
(membrana), was not usually written upon,
but stained ; whence Juvenal speaks below

dns is said to have been the Roman name of “ croceae membrana tabellae '’ (vii. 23).
