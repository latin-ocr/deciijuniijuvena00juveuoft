SATIRA V Ι.

Haec dabit affcctus; ille excludatur amic-us

Jain senior, cujus barbam tua janua vidit.

'Pes-tandi quum sit lenonibus atquc lanistis
Libertas et juris idem contingat arenae,
Non unus tibi rivalis dictabitur heros.

Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio longa ost?
“ O demens, ita servus homo est ²? nil fecerit, esto:
Hoc volo, sie jubeo, sit pro ratione wiluntass’
Imperat ergo viro ε sed mox haec regna relinquit
Permutatque domos et flamca conterit t inde 225

214. Haec dabit affectus, ·‘] ‘She will
appoint 3ou your regirdS. She will bid
3our old friend be refused admittance to
3our house, him whom 3011 have known
from his youth.'’ His friend was now get-
ting old, and he had known him when he
wore a beard, that is in early manliood.
Accio translates this,

“—— Dalla tua casa,
Che ne vide spuntar la prima barba,
Per lei s’ escludera quel vecchio amic0.'’
Holyday takes it iu the same way. Gif-
ford's translation is wrong:

“ Shuts out the ancient friend whose beard
Ihhgvgssgem its downy to its hoary state.”

Middle-aged men did not wear beards ex-
cept such as affected philosophy: ἐκ πώγω-
νος σοφοί, πωγωνοτρόφοι. See Horace, S. ii.
3. 35: “Sapientem pascere barbam.” ‘Ex-
cludatur’ is ‘orders to be excluded.'

216. Testandi quum sic] The power of
making a will belonged only to those citi·
zens who were patresfamilias· See Long's
Art. ¹ Testamentum ' in Sinith's Dict. Ant.
Slaves could not make a will. But free-
men engaged themselves as gladiators,
wrestlers, δια, whom Juvenal means by
‘ arena? (See note on Horace, S. ii. 7.
59: “auctoratus eas.'') As to ‘lanista,'
see S. iii. 158, n. ¹ Juris idem' is the same
extent of privilege. He says the man will
not be as free to make his will and choose
his own heirs as one of these low people,
for his wife will force him to make it as
she pleases, and what is more, will obligo
him to make some of 1113 rivals his ‘ heredes!
As to ⁸ rivalis‚' see above, v. 115.

219. Pone crucem serva] The wife

K

orders the cross to be put up to hang a
slave who has offended her. The husband
remonstrath and hints that inan's life is
sacred, and the slave must not be hung till
some crime is brought home to him. She
calls him a fool for counting a slave a man,
and insists that her will is reason enough
for hang-ing the wretch. The theory of
slavery gave a man power over his slave's
life, aud 110 law prevented him from exerting
this power. His own humanity or inter-
est, or other consideratione, might make
a man cai-efuL but 110 doubt the caprice
or passion of the master was occasionally
fatal to slaves· It was not until the time of
Antoninus (Gaius, i. 53) that this power was
limited by law. See Cic. pro Cluentio,
e. 66, Long's note. Holyday quotes from
Florus (Hist. iii. 20) a lemark woryth of
this virago: ‘nam ct' ipsi (servi) per for-
tunam 111 onmia obnoxii, tamen quasi
seeundum hominum genus suntf’ Gitford
advises every husband to get translated
and hung over liis parlour chimney the
following piece of advice from the sayings
of D. Cato: “Nil temere uxori de servis
crede querenti.”

220. quis testis adest? quis detulit Ζ]
Compare S. x. 69: “Sed quo cecidit sub
crimine? quisnam Delator? quibus indi-
ciis? quo teste probavit?” ‘Audi’ is
‘ hear what 110 has to say?

222. ita servus homo est ?]
slave a inan ?'’ ‘ Ita ’ 111 this way is used
for a question accompanied by surprise.
A few MSS. have ‘ Sic volo, sic jubeo.’

225. flamen conterit .·] “ She wears out
one vcil after another, and after all comes
back to her first husband? As to ‘fla-
meum' sce note on ii. 124. “Conterit
autem, exterit saepe nubendo.’' (Schol.)
