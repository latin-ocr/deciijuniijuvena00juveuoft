SATIRA III.

Sic inde hue omnes tanquam ad vivaria currunt.
Qua fornace graveS, qua non incude, catenae?

Maximus in vinclis ferri modus, ut timeas nc

Yomer deficiat, ne marrae ct sarcula desint.
Felices proavorum atavos, felicia dicas

Saecula, quae quondam sub regibus atque tribunis
Viderunt uno contentam carcere Romam.

place to Terracina. This plain forms a
basin, of which a part is below the level of
the sea. Several small stu-emus flow into
it, and the subterranean drainage os neigh-
bouring basius os greater clevation pours a
great deal of water into the Pomptine plain.
In the early period of Roman history it
was fertile and populous ; and when Appius
made his road across it, about 13.st 310, the
soil must have been firm. The character
of the country must have changed at no
great distance of time aster Appius, for in
B.c. 160 the first attempt to drain the
Pomptinus Ager was made by the consul of
that year, Cornelius Cethegus. Augustus
is said to have taken up the same work,
which was again tried soon after this Satire
was written successively by Nerva and Tra-
jan. The neglect of the middle ages made
the marshes worse than they ever were
in the Roman period. Various popes did
something towards correcting the evil, the
last of whom was Pius Vl„ whose works,
begun in 1778 and continued over a space
of sixteen years, are those to which the
present drainage is due. The plain is almost
entirely uninhabited, but has good pastu-
rage‚and supporta a large number of horned
cattle. The reader is referred to the article
on the Pomptine Marshes in the Penny
Cyclopaedia for further information-

Τ11ε Gallinaria Silva lay on the coast of
Campania between the mouth of the Vul-
turnus and Liternum. It is still called
Pineta di Castel Volturno, though the pine
trees that formerly grew in it and gave it
that name are no longer there.

308. Sic inde huc] ‘ Sic ’ means ‘as we
see? ‘ Vivaria ’ are preserves of game. The
robbers went to Rome as a gentleman goes
to his preserves to shoot. Horace uses
the word in the same sort of way about
will-hunters: “ Excipiantque senes quos in
vivaria. mittant? (Epp, i. 1. 79.)

811. marrae et sarcula] ‘ Mattocks and
hoesss He says so much iron is wanted for
chains for these robbers that there is danger

lest enough be not left sor tools. ‘ Marrn ’

seems to have been an instrument like the
¹ sarculum: but largcr, and used sor heavier
work.

312. Felices proavorum atavam] ‘ Proa-
vus ’ was an ancestor in the third degree, a
great·grandthther‚and ‘atavus’ in the fifth,
so that ‘ proavorum atavi ’ would be eight
generations back. (See note on Hor. C. i.
1. 1 ε “ Maecenas atavis edite regibus.’')
The expression here is general. Ruperti
approves a blunder of some M SS. which he
has not seen, ‘pravorum atavos,' which he
explains by “hominum nuuc male viven-
tium majores.’'

314. uno contentam carcere] This was
the Carcer Mamertinus, which was said to
have been built by Ancus Martius, and en-
largcd by Servius Tullius, under the Capi-
toline Hill. (Hor. Epod. vii. 8, n.) Appius
Claudius the decemvir built a second just
outside the city walls at the entrance of the
ninth region. In this prison happened that
case of tilial piety recorded by Pliny (RN.
vii. 363 Pers. i. 49. n.)‚ a daughter keeping
her mother alive by food from her own
breast; in memory of which a temple was
erected to Pietas near the prison. As Ap-
pius Claudius was put to death in his own
prison 13.c. 44⁴9, J uvenal's golden age lay a
long way back. But he is speaking loosely.
There were other prisons, but there is
nothing particular recorded of them, the
Carcer Mamertinus being always the prin-
cipal one. It was sometimes called Lau-
tumiae, from the prison at Syracuse, which,
being formed in a stone quarry, bore that
name. ‘ Sub regibus atque tribunis ' means
‘ under the kings and the republic.’ ‘ Tri-
buni plebis’ existed under the empire, but
their power, like that of all other magis-
trates of the republican period, was of no
importancc.

315. His alias poteram] There is some
diffcrcnce between ‘ poteram ' and ¹ possem
suhnectere.’ The latter would mean ‘ 1
could have added ifI had had time' (Key's
L. G. 1257) : ‘ poteram ' means ‘ I had
many other reasons to add (or I had it in
