plebeian ‘gens' Popilia. The rich lady he
calls Aurelia. and represents her as selling
as much of her presents as she did not
want. This is the meaning probably. The
Scholiast says Aurelia was the fishwoman.
Ruperti takes it so. But there would be
no point in this.

99. Virroni muraena clatum] The rich
man gets a lamprey for his dinner, which
was a great delicacy, found chiefly in the
Sieilian waters. (See Hor. S. ii. 8. 42, n.)

102. temeraria lina] That is, ‘liuorum
magistri,’ as he calls the fisherman above,
iv. 45.

104. Tiberinus] Perhaps a ‘ lupus' such
as Horace speaks of—

“Unde datum sentis lupus hic Tiberinus an
Cagtiis hiet, pontesne inter jactatus au

amnis

Ostia sub Tusci? ”
(S. ii. 2. 31, where see note.)

The poor guest was put off with a frost-
bitoen, mangy fish, the home-born slave
(vernula) of the river banks, fat with the
filth of the sewers. ‘ Crypta' was used for
any vault or closed passage. Here it means
a sewer. As to the Saburra, see iii. 5, n.
By ‘crypta Suburrae’ Juvenal means a
branch of the Cloaca Maxima (as to which
nee S. iii. 31, n..) Topenetrate so far, the
flsh must swim nearly a mile through all
the fflth of the town. [Ribbeck has‘ tor-

pente cloaca,’ no improvement. ]

107. Ipsi pauca velina] These verses to
113 arc parenthetieal, for he returns to the
dinner in 114. [Ribbeck has not put them
in his text.] “ I should be glad to speak a
word or tw'o to the master himself, if he
will listen to me? He goes on to ay that
no one expects from him the hbm a11t3 ofa
Seneca, a Piso, or a Cotta, for in foimer
times it was eounted mole noble to be
gener ous ‘chan‘ gl eat 3 all that w as w anted of
him was to dine as ιι citizen, not as a king;
and theu hc may give or not give, and do
what he likes with his money. Both the
Senecas, father and son, were rich ; the
younger, Nero's teachcr, was unusually so.
Martial mentions him wi'th others funous
for liberalit3 *- “ Pisones Senecasque Mem-
miosque Et) Crispos mihi redde” (xii. 36).
C. Piso is he who formed ιι conspiracy
against Nero, for which he and Seneca lost
their lives. His wealth he inherited from
his mother according to the Scholiast, who
speaks of his magnific-cuce and generosity,
of which and his great popularity Tacitus
speaks in his Anu-als (xv. 48). lt is quite
uncertain what Cotta Juvenal means.
Tacitus mentions one Aurelius Cotta who
had been rich and had squandered his
money, and got ιι pension from Nero (Ann.
xiii. 3-1). The commcntators take this for
Juvenal's man. (Sec vii. 95.)

110. titulis] See i. 130.
