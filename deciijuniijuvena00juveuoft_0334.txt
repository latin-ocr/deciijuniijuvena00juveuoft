55

Praesidia afferimus navem factura minorem.
I 1111110 et ventis animam committe dolato
Confisus ligno, digitis a morte remotus
911311101- aut septem, si sit latissima taeda.

Mox 011111 reticulis et pane et ventre lagenae

60

Aspice sumendas in tempestate secures.

Sed postquam jacuit planum mare, tempora postquam
Prospera vectoris fatumque valentius Euro

Et pelago, postquam Parcae meliora benigna

Pensa manu ducunt hilares et staminis albi

Lanificae, modica nec multum fortior aura
Ventus adest, inopi miserabilis arte cucurrit

“per obstantes catervas Explicuit sua
victor arma.’'

57. Inane et ventis animam committe]
As to ‘I nunc' see x. 310, n. ‘Dolato
ligno' is not a smooth plauk as Mr.
Mayor says, but rough—hewn with a
dolabra. (S. viii. 248.) A ‘digitus' was
one-sixteenth of an English foot: four or
seven is a conventional way of speaking.
See xiv. 289. Heinrich refers to the say-
ing ascribed to Anacharsis by Diogenes
Laertius (i. 103), μαθὼν τέτταρας δακτύ-
λους εἶναι τὸ πάχος τῆς νέως, τοσοῦτον,
ἔφη, τοῦ θανάτου τοὺς πλέοντας ἀπέχειν.
Ruperti has abundance of quotations on
the terrors of the deep, which Horace
sums up in xvoful ternis in the third
ode of the first book. ‘Taeda' is the
generic name for the trees yielding tar,
including several varieties of the ‘pi11us,’
of which many were used 111 ship-build-
ing: for which reason ‘pinus' is fre-
quently used for a ship, though ‘taeda’
only here.

60. Mox cum reticulis] ‘After you
have thought of that, then look at what
xou have to take xx 1tb 011 101 the voyage,
a bag of bread, a big lagena, and hat-
chets,' which makes a ludicrous climax.

‘Reticulis et pane' 15 the same as ‘reti-
culum panis' in Hor. S. i. 1. 47. ‘Reti-
culum' is a netted bag, commonly used it
seems for this purpose. The ‘lagena’
was the same as the ‘amphora‚’ and
‘ ventre lagenae ' is like ‘ Montani venter‚’
‘the big-bellied Montanus,’ S. iv. 107.

62. tempora postquam Prospera vee-
torz's] ‘But when the passenger’s lucky
time arrived, and fate more mighty than
the wind and sea ς’ that is, when the day
came back and 1115 fate began to prevail

over the eleinents, where ‘fatum ' is used
as in S. xi. 105, “ferae mansuescere
jussae Imperii fato,’' and “fortuna ipsius
et- urbis Servatum victo caput abstulit '³
(x. 285). As to the Parcae and their
spinning see S. iii. 27, n.; xiv. 249.
Their spinning white threads was a good
sign. See Martial iv. 73:

“Ultima volventes orabat pensa sorores,

Ut traherent parva stamina pulla
mora,”

where the threads are black and life cotn-
ing to an end.

67. inopi miserabilis arte] ‘The wretch-
ed ship with beggarly shifts goes on, with
clothes spread out and foresail, the only
sail that's left. ' ‘ Inopi arte’ means
such poor means as the storin had re-
duced her to. They spread clothes for
sails, the only 0110 that xxas left being
that xx hich ran out from the 110115. Taci-
tus describes 5111115 returning after a storm
‘intentis vestibus ' (Ann. ii. 24). The
foresail was called ‘dolo :' it was a fore
and aft 5311 of small size. Livy mentions
it (xxxvi. 44, 45). The rig of the Roman
sailing ships however seems not to be very
well understood. There was 3, 5311 called

‘artemQ’ which some think was the main-
sail. So our translators render it in St.
Paul's voyage (Acts xxvii. 40). It seems
doubtful whether that can be right.
They would be more likely under the cir-
cumstances to hoist the foresail or jib, as
we call it, if they had one. The Scholiast
says the ‘artemo ' is meant here. The
larger ships had two square-rigged masts.
‘ Prora’ is used generally for the ship and
particularly for the fore part ‘ with its own
sail.’
