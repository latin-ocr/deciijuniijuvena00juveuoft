SATIRA XI.

INTRODUCTION.

JUVENAL invites his friend, whom he calls Persicus, to dinner, and prepares him for
plain fare by observations on the conduct of those who with small means affect the
indulgences of the rich, and who squander the little they have upon their belly. This
extravagance he associatos with self-ignorance, and takes occasion to commend that
golden rule of life, KNOW THYSELF. He gives a simple account of his own table and
establishment, comparing his own way of living with that of the worthies of former
days, and contrasting it with the display and profusion of modern times, in respect to
furniture, servants, and foml, as well as the wanton entertainments with which the
fashionable dinners of his day were accompanied.

The time is that of the Megalesian festival in honour of Cybele, that is in April, and
Juvenal was not young when he wrote. The composition is in Horace's style, without
any appearance of imitation. The subject is not large, and there is no great variety of
treatment. But as a picture of domestic manners and of a household of the better sort
the satire is pleasing. If further historical evidence were needed than is abundantly
found elsewhere 111 respect to the sels-indulgence of the rich and their way of living, this
satire would supply it. The principal commonplace is sensibly put, the simplicity os
the olden time is described in a graphic way, there is heartiness in the invitation, and
the occasion is marked with dramatic distinctness in the concluding lines.

ARGUMENT.

If Atticus lives well he's reckoned generous ; if Rutilus, a madman. All men laugh
to see a pauper epicure, and so all talk of Rutilus. He's young and stout enough
for the warS‚ and yet (with the prince's leave) it's said he means to train for the
arena. There's many a man who lives but for his palate, for whom his creditor looks
out at the entrance of the market. The poorest live the best, just on the verge of
bankruptcy. Meanwhile they search the elements for daintieS, regardless of the
price, or in their hearts preferring what is dcarest. For men so reckless it is not
hard to get the money. They'll 5011 their dishes or their mother's image, to season
for four hundred sesterces a glutton's crockery. ’Tis thus they come to gladiators'
fare.

V. 21. That then which riches make respectable is wanton luxury in the poor. The
man of learning who knows not the difference between a cash chest and a little
purse Ι (10 well to despise. That rule came down from heaven, “ KNOW THYSELF.'’
Remember it when you think of marrying or entering the Senate (Thersites did not
seek Achilles' armour in which Ulysses made a. doubtful figure) ; or if you aim at
pleading some great cause, think who you are, whether a migbty speaker or mere
mouther. In great things or in small take your own measure. Buy not a mullet if
