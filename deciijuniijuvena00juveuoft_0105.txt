SATIRA III. 55,

Nec tamen Antiochus, ncc crit mirabilis illic
Aut Stratocles aut cum molli Demetrius Haemo :

Natio comoeda cst.

Concutitur3 flet si lacrimas conspexit amici,

Nec dolct; igniculum brumae si tempore poscas,
Accipit endromidem ; si dixeris, aestuo, sudat.
Non sumus ergo pares : melior qui semper ct omni

Nocte dieque potest alienum sumere vultum,

A facie jactare manus, laudare paratus

Si bene ructavit, si rectum minxit amicus,

Si trulla inverso crepitum dedit aurea s undo.
Praeterea sanctum nihil est et ab inguine tutum :

man! The mask is put for the man
who wore it. ‘Palliolum' was a small
square eloth worn over the head to protect

H. But yet methinks it is very sultry
and hot for my complexion.
Ο. Exceedingly, my lord‚ it is very sultry

titutes, to hide the face. Men only wore
it when they were sick, wherefore Ovid re-
commends the lover to wear it (A. A. i.

733, sq.) ι

“Arguat et macies animum; nec turpe
putaris
Palliolum nitidis implicuisse comis.’'

For ‘nullo’ Jahn has adopted the conjec-
tui-al word ‘pullo.’ All the MSS. have
“nullo ;’ and Priscian quotes the verse with
that word (iii. 7. 41). The note explains
the force of ‘nullo-³

98. Nec tamen Antiochus‚] ‘And yet
there (in Greece) even Antiochus Stra-
tocles, Demetrius, and Haemus would not
be thought much of, for they are a nation
of comic actore? Stratocles and Demetrius
are mentioned by Quintilian (xi. 3. 178).
Haemus is referred to in S. vi. 199 with

phorus3 he and Antiochus are not
found elsewhere.

103. Accipit endromidem ;] This was a
thick Gaulish blanket, worn in cold wea-
ther, οι· when a man had heated himself by
running, from which the name is derived.
Martial has an epigram upon it describiug
its various uses (iv, 19). The diminutive
‘igniculum’ is osten used by Cicero in a
metaphorica] sense; there is no particular
force in it here. Gifford quotes Hamlet's
dialogue with Osric:

“ Ο. 1 thank your lordship‚ ’tis very hot.
H. No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the
wind is northerly.
Ο. It is indifferent cold, my lord‚ indeed.

The Scholiast quotes from Terence (Eun.
ii. 2. 19) Gnatho’s speech: “Negat quis,
nego ; ait, aio: postremo imperavi egomet
mihi Omnia assentari.'’

104. Non sumus erqo pare-s· 5] This verse
Jahn marks as spurious [and Ribbeck also].
It is hard to say why. The MSS. all have
it, and John of Salisbury quotes it (Nugae,
ἃς. iii. 4). See v. 108, n.

106. A facie jactare manua] Bringing
the hand to the lips and kissing it, to throw
the kiss towards a person by way of respect,
as (iv. 118) “ Blandaque devexae jactaret
basia rhedae.’' (See also vi. 584, n.) In
Phaedrus (v. 7) a musician, in return for
the applause of the audience‚ which he
supposes is meant for him, kissae his hand
by way of acknowledgment:

“ In plausus consurrectum est. J aetat basia
Tibicen ; gratulari fautores putat.’'

Tacitus says of Otho, “Nec deerat pro-
tendens manus adorare vulguS, jacere os-
cula, et onmia serviliter pro dominatioffess'
(Hist. i. 36.) ‘Adorare' is derived from
this custom, which is of Eastern origin.
With us it implies more familiarity than it
did with the ancients. The old commen·
tators have mistaken the passage, except
Holyday‚ who thinks this may be its mean-
ing. It can be nothing else. Gifford’s
translation, “At deeds of shame their hands
admiring raisc‚’' is quite wrong. Dryden
speaks of ‘⁶ the panegyrick hand.”

108. Si trulla inverso] ‘Trulla‚' which
is connected with the Greek τρύβλιον, is
