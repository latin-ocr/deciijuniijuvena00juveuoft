SATIRA XVI.

365

Vivo patre datur: nam quae sunt parta labore
Militiae placuit non esse in corpore census,

Omne tenet cujus regimen pater.
Signorum comitem castrorumque aera merentem
Quamvis jam tremulus captat pater.

Ergo Coranum
55
Hunc labor aequus

Provehit et pulcro reddit sua dona labori.
Ipsius certe ducis hoc referre videtur
Ut qui fortis erit sit felicissimus idem,

Ut laeti phaleris omnes et torquibus omnes-—

peculium.' This. as Heinrich says, is an
argument in favour of the satire having
been written before the time of Constantine,
A.D. 306 (see Dict. Ant„ Long's article
‘ Patria Potestas '). Both were strictly the
property of the ‘ paterfamilias? ‘ Non esse
in corpore census ' means that it was not
part of the property which was under his
father’s control. Forcellini quotes from
the Digest “ corpus patrimonii '’ (iv. 2. 20)
and “omnia corpora maternae haeredita-
tis” (xxxi. 77, 20). ‘ Placuit’ means only
that it is settled law. The legal word for
‘ regimen ' is ‘ potestas.’

54. Ergo Coranum Signorum comitem]
Horace (S. ii. 5. 55, sqq.) refers to the story
of one Nasica, a fortune-hunter, who was
laughed at by one Coranus. The name
Coranus seems to have become proverbial
in this connexion. This man, because he
has got money of his own which he has
the power to dispose of, is courted by his
own father, trembling with years, in hopes
he may survive his rich son yet, and get
something by his will. ‘Captare' is the
common word in this sense. See v. 98, n. 3
vi. 40; x. 202; xii. 114. Heinrich thinks
it should be ‘captat socer,' ‘pater’ occurriug
just in the same place two lines above. If
so, the man wants to get him for his
daughter. But there is no authority for
this change. ’

56. Hunc labor aequus] There is no
sense in this. Jahn [and Ribbeck] have
adopted a. conjecture of Ruperti’s, who
thinks ‘labor ’ should be ‘favor.’ Heinrich
fflffl‘ssffsssffusss ⁰133. *i‘e'ssssssi'dffssp'fssssissefffi
Speratum meritis? ‘ b ’ and ‘v ' are
and if the
word ‘favor' were written ‘fabor-,⁹ the
transition to ‘labor’ is easily accounted
for. This is the only conjecture that has
thrown light on the passage. ‘Pulcro
labori' is the same as ‘labore militiae’

above (52). ‘ Hunc ' does not refer ‘t
the latter of the two persons, a commo
usage.

58. ducis Ῐιοσ referre videtur] This us
of the genitive with ¹ referre ' is easily un
dei-stood by resolving ‘ referre ’ into it
parts, ‘ rem ferre ;’ where ‘ rem ’ is ‘ the in
tercst ’ of a person or something which con>
cerns him (Key's Lat. Gr. ξ 910, note)
Here it is said to be for the interest of the.
commander himself that he who is bravc
should also be most fortunate, that all (who
deserve them) should be made happy with
decorations, which were as much prized by
Roman soldiers as by our own. They were
confer-red in a way to enhance their value.
In the presence of all the troops such men
as had distinguished themselves by particu-
lar acts of gallantry were called up before
the Commander-in-chief and by him pre-
sented with decorations varying according
to their exploits.

60. Ut laeti phaleris omnes] Lipsius (de
Mil. Rom. v. 17) treats ‘phalerae’ and
‘ torques ’ as nearly alike‚ ‘ phalerae ' being
collars that hung down on the obest, and
‘ torques ’ fitting close to the neck. Poly-
bius (vi. 39, Bekker) speaks of ¹ phalara '
as rewards given to cavalry soldiers,
which has led many to suppose they werc
part of the trappings of a horse (Dict. Ant.
‘ Phalera '). The word is commonly used fo·
the ornaments on the harness and for th«
harness itself (xi. 103). But it appears
also to have been a decoration worn by sol-
diers round the neck, as Lipsius shows.
‘ Torques ’ probably included armlets and
bracelets as well as collars for the neck.

The repetition of ‘omnes’ shows either a
corrupt text or an unfinished and uncor-
rected fragment. No imitator would inten-
tionally write such a verse, much less one
who could imitate as well as this writer. 1
prefer treating it as a fragment abruptly
stopping in the middle of a sentence.
