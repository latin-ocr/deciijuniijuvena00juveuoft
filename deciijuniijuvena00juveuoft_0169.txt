that was wanting’ m the play of the coar δἐι
character of the old Atellanes.

72. Geslibus Autonoes· ‚·] With the
gesticulations of Autonoe, who was the
sister of Cadmus, and who, as one of the
Bacchantes, helped her sister Agave to
destroy Pentheus. This story, though
tragic enough, must' in some way have been
got into an Atellane play, probably as a
travestie.

74. Chrysogonum cantmmevetent ·] Clu y
sogonus is a fictitious name for a singer.
By forcing the man to acts of lewdness
they spoilt his voice.

75. ut Quintilianus ametur ἲ] Juvenal
had a great respect for Quintilian, who was
his contemporary, and some say his master
in rhetoric. “Do you suppose (says he)
any one would fall in love with a Quin-
tilian? Tbese ladies look for something
more to their purpose.”

77. choraules] The man who played the
‘tibia’ to the singing of the chorus. The
‘citharoedus’ played upon the ‘cithara’ as
an accompaniment to his own voice or
without singing. The names here men-
tioned are unknown, except that of Gla-
phyrus, who was awell- known flute- -player‚

‘tibicem’ This performer, unlike the‘ cho-
raules: played solo pieces. There are two
very complimen'tary epigrams to this Gla-

phy rus by Antipater of Thessalonica, in
Brunck's Anthobgy, v. ii. p. 116, one of
which begins,

Ὀρφεὺῖ θήρας ἔπειθε, σὺ δ’ Ὀρφέα· Φοῖβος
'’effuga-yn, σοὶ δ’ εἴκει μελπομένῳ, Γλοί-

φυρε.
Martial mentions him with one Canus (Ep.
iv. 5), ‘Plaudere nec Cano plaudere nec
Glaphyro,” from which epigram and others
it appears these people made a great deal

of money (see' iii. 4 and 31).
78. figamus pulpita vicos‚] These‘ pul-

pita,' which he tells him to ercet along the
streets, are connected with the marriage
festivities, but the commentators differ in
explaining the word. Forcellini says they
were stages erected for the purpose of
exhibiting some show. Grangaeus and
Achaintre say much the same. Valesius,
quoted by Ruperti with approval, says the
poets built stages on which they recited

‘epithalamia ' composed on the occasion of
any great wedding. All this is guess-work.
Heinrich is probably right in supposing the
‘pulpita' to be scaffolds on which spectators
stood to sce the marriage processioa. The
streets of Rome, till a late period of the
Empire, were very narrow and inconve-
nient.

79. Ornentur postes] This is repeated
from v. 51. See also xii. 91, ‘⁶ longos
erexit janua ramos,'' &c.

80. Ut testudineo]
gauze curtain, and here is used for a bed
which has such. It is commonly used in
hot countries for keepin g off the mosquitoes
and flies. As to the form of the word, see
note on Hor. Epod. ix. 15 :

‘Conopeum ' is a

‘⁶ Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol adspicit conopium‚'’

where the allusion is to Egypt, and the
form is different, as it is in Propertius, iii.
11. 45: “Foedaque Tarpeio conopia ten-
dere saxo.” It was common to inlay fur-
niture with tortoise-shell. Martial speaks
of tables so inlaid ε “ Et testudineum men-
sus quater hexaclinon ’¹ (ix. 60), aud
“Accipe lunata scriptum testudine sigma.'’
He calls his friend Lentulus here. It was
the name of a high patrician family of the
gens Cornelia.

81. Euryalum mirmillonem] Euryalus
is unknown. ‘Mirmillones' were one of
the many kinds of gladiators who were
distinguished by the arms tliey carried.
The origin of the name ‘mirmilloncs’ is
