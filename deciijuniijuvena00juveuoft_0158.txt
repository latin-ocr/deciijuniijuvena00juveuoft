108 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

among us? And then 110 wants a wif'e of the old stamp! Blced him, ye doctors.
A pretty fellow! Go give a calf to Juno if your wife 15 chaste: there are but few
01111 touch the crowns of Ceres, few whom their fathers would not loathe to kiss.
well, go and wreathe the flowers about your door3 your wife will with one husband
be content,—-nay sooner with one eye. ch’vc heard, to bc sure, of one who lived
chaste at her father's country-place. But let her live so in the country-town: or I
grant you at her fathcr's seat3 but who can tell what goes on there? Arc Jupiter
and Mars so old?

V. 60. 111 all the porticoes and theatres can you see one whom it were 511ἲο to wod? See
how they melt at the lascivious dance, and catch each sigh aud learn it! Others
when theatres arc closed get up their private plays. One likes the faree player‚
one the comic, one the tragic actor, another spoils the singer's voice. What, do you
think any would love Quintilian? You marry that musicians may beget your
children, or your babe may show the face of the mirmillo in his own. Hippia, the
senator's wife, went off to Egypt wit-h a player 3 and e’en Canopus cried shame on our
morals. Forgetful of her home, the wretch‚ and country, her sponse, her sister, and
her 50115, yea even games and Paris she abandoned. Nurtured iu luxury, she
‹lespised the sea ; her character she had despised before—-a trifling loss among these
melting dames. Yes‚ she bore the dangers of so many seas 3 but when ’tis duty calls
them, then they tremble. They're bold enough for sin, but if their husbands bid them
go on board, 'tis hard ; such nasty smells, they're siek, the skics go round,—their
stomach's strong enough when ’tis their paramours they follow. One vomits on her
husband, while the other dines with the sailors, wanders about the deck, and pulls
the ropeS. that was it charmed our Hippia so, that she could bear to be called a
player’s wife? Sergiolus was no boy, his face was ugly, his forehead scarred‚ a wen
upon his nose‚ his eye for ever dropping. But he was a gladiator3 this was his
beauty, 'twas for this she gave up all. They love the steel z let Sergius take the rudis,
and he's no better than her husband.

V. 114. Why care for private houses? Look at the rivals of our gods, and hear what
Claudius had to bear. His strumpet wife stole from his bed, covered her head, and
with one slave girl went and took her stand by the brothel door, exposed her person,
told her price, and took whoever came, sad only when the time came round that she
must go.

V. 133. Why should Ι speak of charms, philtres‚ and poisoned step-children P When
their sex’s madness drives them, lust is their smallest fault.

V. 136. But why’s Caesennia virtuous, by her husband's showing? She brought him a
round 511111, that’s what his testimony’s worth : 'twas not the bow or torch of love that
won him, her money is the torch, her d—qs the arrows. He buys what liberty he has ς
the greedy man's rich wife is as a maid 3 before his face 5110 110(15 1111(1 writes to her
lover. Why does Sertorius love Bibula? Because she’s pretty. Three wrinkles, a
black tooth, a drier skin, and then, “ Paek up your bag-gage and beg0ne‚'' he cries 3
“ I'm tired of you, besides you wipe your nose. Off with you! there’s another coming
with dry nose.'' Till then she's a hot tyrant3 asks for the finest wools and wines—
nay that's but little—whole prisons full of slaves. thatever's to be had she buys ς
goes to the fair, takes up the finest crystals, porcelain‚ diamonds‚ such as Agrippa
gave his sister.

V. 161. But of so many is there not one good? Let her have beauty, grace, weasth,
fertile womb, ancestors, chastity3 be she a bird as rare as a black swan, who could endure
a wife with every virtue? I had rather, yea I'd rather have a country girl than the
mother of the Gracchi, if with her great virtues she’s to bring a pride as great, and
count her triumphs in her portiont away with Hannibals and SyphaxeS‚ and all your
Carthage put together. “ Spare my boys, Paean, spare, Diana3 slay their mother, for
