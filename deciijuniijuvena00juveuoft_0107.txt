SATIRA III. 57

Discipulumque senex, ripa nutritus in illa
Ad quain Gorgonei delapsa est pinna caballi.
Non est Romano cuiquam locus hic, uhi regnat

Protogenes aliquis vel Diphilus aut Hermam-us,

Qui gentis vitio nunquam partitur amicum,

Solus habet.

Nam quum facilem stillavit in aurem

Exiguum de naturae patriaeque venenO,

Limine summoveor ς perierunt tempora longi
Nusquam minor est jactura clientis.

Servitii.

Quod porro officium, ne nobis blandiar, aut quod
Pauperis hic meritum, si curet noete togatus
Currere, quum praetor lictorem impellat et ire
Praecipitem jubeat dudum vigilantibus orbis,

Ne prior Albinam et Modiam collega salutet?

Divitis hie servi claudit latus ingenuorum

supporta the reading of all the MSS. against
a conjecture of Ritter's adopted by ΜΓ.
Mayor [and Ribbeck] ‘discipulam’ (Tac.
Hist. iv. 10. 40). See note on S. i. 33.

117. ripa nutritus in illa] The Scholiast
says this was the city of Tarsus, which was
situated on the banks of the Cydnus in
Cilicia, and was supposed to have been
founded by Perseus· Pegasus, who is said
to have sprung from the blood of the Gorgon
Medusa, when Perseus slew her at Tartessus
in Spain, is supposed to have dropped a
hoof here (ταρσός), and thus to have given
its name to the city. But this is not what
Juvenal says, and it is impossible to say
what place h'e means,

120. Protogenes aliquis] All these are
Greek names representing pmasites, who
contrived to monopolize their great friends
as only Greeks were wont (‘ gentis vitio ²).
The Scholiast calls them μονοφιλεΐς. What
follows is bitter enough. As to ‘ summo-
veor' see S. i. 37, n.

125. jactura clientis] It must be re-
membered that the word ‘ eliens' is used to
express a totally different relation between
patron and dependant from what it ex·
pressed in the earlier times of the republic.
At this time it did not involve a legal and
pontica] distinction, and meant no more
than a humble friend, a dependant who
looked to another for support, counsel, and
so forth. ‘Jactura' is explained by For-
cellini as “ ἀποβολή quod ex navi in mare
jacitur in tempestate, ejus exonerandae
causa.” ‘⁴ ¹ .Ῐ acturam facere ' is to throw a

thing away it seems to save the rest.'’
(Long on Caesar, B. G. vi. 12.) ‘ To throw

a person overboard ' is a common conversa-
tional phrase with uS, meaning to get rid
of him.

126. Quod porro [fficium] He here
enters upon a subject we have had before
(S. i. 101, n.). He says ‘ what is the good
of the poor inan’s service and attentions if
his betters are to become his rivals, and
when he takes pains to run before daybreak
to pay his duty to the rich, he finds a prae-
tor has got there before himP' ‘Porro’
means ‘to proceed,' ‘in the next plaee.'
‘ Ne nobis blandiar’ is another way of say-
ing ‘ to speak the truth.' It seems like a
conversational idiom, as ‘si verum admit-
timus' below, v. 171. As to ‘togatus‚’ see
S. i. 96. There were at this time eighteen
praetors in the city (Dig. 1. tit. 2. s. 34).
Eaeh praetor had two lictors allowed him.
‘ Ire praecipitem jubeat' is a common ex-
pression of haste. ‘Orbus' was the legal
word for a married person who had no
children. The speaker means to say these
rich ladies have long been up waiting for
their visitors, and the praetor is in a fright
lest one of his colleagues should get to the

house before him.
131. Divitis hic servi] ‘ Claudere latus ’

means in effect to give a man you are walk-
ing with the wall. See note on Horace,
S. ii. 5. 17. “ Ne tamen illi 'ru comes ex-
terior si postulet ire recuses. Utne tegam
spureo Damae latus ?’' Ulysses asks indig-
nantly. The ‘ servus' is now a freedman,
and the young gentleman is glad to wait
upon him. ‘ Ingenuus ' is one born of free
parents (see Hor. S. i. 6. 6, n.). ‘ Alter ’
means the freedman, and what follows is
