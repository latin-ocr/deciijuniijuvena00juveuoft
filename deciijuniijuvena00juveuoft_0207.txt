SATIRA Y-I. 157
Stat Fortuna improba noctu 605
Hos fovet omnes
Hos amat, his se

Quod desipis inde ost,

Et furere incipias, ut avunculus ille Neronis,

prets the former ‘tmnsi.’ The joys and
vows are those of the husband, who has
been wishing for a son. As to ‘lacus,'
which were the public tanks from which
the poorer people drew water who could
not afford to have it laid on at their
house& see note on Hor. S. i. 4. 37. They
are called here ‘ spurc05,’ ‘ muddy,' which
such placeS, trodden by many people at
all hours with water-pots) would always
be. The Pontifices were the principal reli-
gious college at Rome, fifteen in number
at this time, and formed the supreme
court in matters relating to religion. The
Salii formed two other college-S, one con-
nected with the worship of Mars, the other
of Quirinus. The Pontifices might be
plebeians, but the Salii were chosen from
the patriciam, which makes the case worse.
As to the Scauri, who are here as before
put for any noble family, see note on S.
ii. 35.

603. Ad spurcos] [In this verse Ribbeck
has ‘saepe inde ς’ and in v. 606 he has
‘ ulnis' for ‘omneS.’]

608. Secretumque sibi mimum parat]
“ Makes herself a private farce‚'' as Horace
says (C. iii. 29. 49) :

“ Fortuna saevo laeta negotio et
Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax.”

Juvenal calls her ‘improba,' ‘sly‚’ like
Horace’s old woman of Thebes, “ anus im-
proba Thebis Ex testamento sic est elata ’'
(S. ii. 5. 84). This picture of Fortune
donting and chuckling over her found-
lings, and presenting them to the great
people as their own, and amusing herself
throughout their career with the secret
of their birth, laughing at the homage

paid to their blood and at the unconscious
contamination the exclusives are incurring,
is a tine pieee of satire. ‘ Fortunae filius ’
(Hor. S. ii. 6. 49) and παῖς τύχης (Soph.
Oed. R. 1080) were ordinary phrases. ⁴ His
se ingerit' means she heaps her favours
upon them.

610. Hic magicos affert cantu-sn] The
next vice dealt with is the administer-ing
of love-potions, the common effect of which
was madness. Ovid says (A. A. ii. 105) :

“Nec data profuerint pallentia philtra
Plfilltklzlhfiocent animis vimque furoris
a ent.'’

There is a story that Lucretius was driven
mad by a philtre. Thessalian witches,
drugS‚ charms, were proverbial. See Hor.
C. i. 27. 21: “quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis poterit deus? '¹ Epod.
v. 45. Epp. ii. 2. 209.ι Juvenal says that a
man is lueky if he only becomes a drivel-
ler, lets his wife beat him with her slip-
pers, and so forth. ‘ Furere ’ and ‘ furor '
apply to insanity with violence. ‘ Desipis’
and ‘gessisti’ are addressed to any hus-
band so victimized. I say this because
Ruperti says it is au “apostrophe ad
maritum vel Postumum,'’ which is nou-
sense.

615. avunculus ille Neronia-l Caligula
was the brother of Agrippina, mother of
the Emperor Nero. They were the chil-
dren of Germanicus Caligula married
Milonia Caesonia (Dion, 59. 23) after hav-
ing· lived in adultcry with her. Suetonius
(Calig. 50) says, “Creditur potionatus a
Caesonia uxore amatorio quidem medica-
mento scd quod iu furorem vertit.” His
