and bladders full of storms and comrades turned to swine were not so hard to swallow.
He had no witness to support him 3 but my story, a crime not known in all the trage-
dies, was acted publicly the other day.

V. 32. Two neighbouring peoples, Ombites and Tentyrites, have long fallen out with
deadly hatred‚ only for this, that each maintain there are 110 other gods bnt those they
worship. It was a holiday at 0111111, a fit occasion sor the enemy, who were resolved
to spoil their seven-days' sport (for these barbarians vie with the infamous Canopus in
good living) : and they expected easy victory when they were drenched with wine. On
0110 side there was dancing‚ flowcrs‚ perfumes 3 on the other, hatred and an empty belly.
First they begin abusing with hot courage ; this is the trump of battle. Then they
charge with mutual shout : their weapons are their fists ; scarce any cheeks were left
without a wound, or any nose unbroken. Faces contused you’d see throughout the
host, checks burst and bones all starting through the skin, fists reeking with the blood
of eyes knocked out. But this is child's play ε what use is such a crowd of combatants
if none are killed Ρ So they grow fiercer and throw stenes, not such as Turnus, Ajax,
or Tydides threw, but such as men can wield in these degenerate days, when all are
bad and puny, so that heaven laughs at men and hates them.

V. 72. But to return. One party reinforced get bold and ply the sword and bow, the
other fly and Tentyra pursues. One slips and falls in his haste ; they take him pri-
soner and cut him up and eat him raw. How lucky they profaned not the holy ele-
ment 1 I’m sure you must be happy it escaped 1 But they who ate had never amore
pleasant meal. Don't think it was the first taste only that was sweet; the last man
when the carcase was all gone seraped up the blood and lieked it from his fingers.

V. 93. The Vascones they tell 115 lengthened life by food like this: but that was for-
tune’s spite and war’s extremity, a long blockade and famine. Such cases we should
pity, when after all their food is gone to the last blad'e of grass, men eat each other,
as they would themselves : these gods and men may pard0n‚ as the ghosts would do
of those they’ve eaten. Zeno may teaeh us all things must not be done even for life;
but how should they be Stoics, and that in old Metellus' time ? Now all the world
have got our learning and the Greek too. Gaul teaehes Britain how to plead and
Thule talks of hiring soon a rhetorician. But yet that noble people and Saguntum had
some excuse sor what they did. But Egypt was more savage than the Tauric altar 3
for there (if we’re to trust the story) the goddess only sacrificed the men and nothing
more. What led these people to their 0111110, what accident, blockade, or famine?
Suppose the Nile had left the country dry, what greater insult could they show the god Ρ
The Cimbri, Britones, and Scythians were never yet so savage as this useless cowardly
herd, who swarm upon the river in their painted boats. No punishment is hard
enough for those whose passion is as bad as famine.

V. 131. Nature has given soft hearts to men, as tears will prove. She bids us weep for
friends in sorrow, for the poor wretch on trial for his life, or boy that brings his
fraudulent guardian to justice, whose weepiug face and streaming hair might be a
girl’s. She bids us weep when a young maiden dies or little babe. What good man
and true but counts all human miseries his own Ρ ’Tis this distinguishes 115 men from
beasts ; for this we've minds to take in things divine and exercise all arts 3 and sense
from heaven, which they have not who look down on the earth. They've breath but
we have spirit, so that sympathy bids us seek mutual help, join in communities‚ and
quit the woods our fathers lived in, build 11011505, join our habitations for mutual
safety, stand by each other and proteetsshe fallen, fight altogether at one signal, share
the same walls and towers. But now the snakes are more harmonious than we are;
the wild beast preys not on his kind : but as for man 'tis not enough to have forged
the fatal sword, though the first smiths knew only to make tools. But now we see
whole peoples not content with killing in their passion, but they must eat each other-
