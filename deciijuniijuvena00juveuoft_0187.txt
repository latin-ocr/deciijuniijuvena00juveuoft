SATI RA VI.

1:37

Nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis ex quo

Paupertas Romana perit : hine fluxit ad istos

Et Sybaris colles, hine et Rhodos et Miletos

Prima peregrinos obscena pecunia mores
Intulit, et turpi fregerunt secula luxu

Divitiae molles.

295

Atque coronatum et petulans madidumque Tarentum.
Quid enim Venus ebria curat? 300

Inguinis et eapitis quae sint discrimina nescit,
Grandia quae mediis jam noctibus ostrea mordet,
Quum perfusa mero spumant unguenta Falerno,
Quum bibitur coneha, quum jam vertigine tectum

305

Ainbulat et geminis exsurgit mensa lucernis.

Hoc paces habuere bonae, ventique se-
cundL”

‘ Luxuria incubuit (orbi) ' is like Horace’s

“ Et nova febrium Terris incpguit {oggrjn
s. 1. . .

295. hinc fluxit ad istos] ‘Hinc’ is
‘ from this time! ‘Istos ' is a conjectural
reading of some antiquity. Most MSS.

have Histros or Istros, from which the
reading of the text has been derived. P.
has Indos, and Jahn has adopted it. What
Indos can have to do here 1 cannot say. As
to ‘perit‚’ see v. 559. [Ribbeck, v. 295 :
‘hinc fiuxit Aminsos Et Sybaris sollcrs,
&c.’

2536. Et Sybaris eolles‚]
dated with truth the deterioration of their
morals from their first intimate intercourse
with the Greek colonies. (See note on Hor.
Epp. ii. 1. 156, “Graecia capta ferum vic-
torem cepit.'') Τ110 conquest of Sicily, and
its annexation to Rome as a province, gave
the first heavy blow to the severity of the
olden time. And when the 011105 of Magna
Graecia were reduced, and 51111 more when
the kingdom of Attalus became a Roman
province, the habits of luxury, for which
the Ionian Greeks in particular were noto-
rious, were imported with the wealth re-
quired for their indulgence. On this subject
and the evils that flowed into Rome from
Eastem Asia through the province of Syria,
we have a good deal in the 3rd Satire,
v. 58, sqq. On 1110 condition of the pro-
vince Asia and its relations with Rome, see
Long’s Excursus, Cic. Orat. vol. ii. p. 285.
Cicero speaks of it as “tam corruptrice
provincia,'' Ep. ad Qu. Fr. i. 1. 6.

Τ110 ancient Greek town of Sybaris, near
the Gulf of Tarentum, had ceased to exist
long before 1110 Romans had crossed 1110

Τ110 Romans

Apennines. It was founded 13.c. 720 by
Achaeans and Troezeniuns, 01111 was de-
stroyed in a civil war, nc. 510. But in
two centuries the people had established a
name which is a proverb 10 11115 day. The
town of Thurii rose in its place, and was
the Sybaris of Juvenal's time. Rhodes
was not a part of the Roman Empire till
the reign of Vespasian, who made it and
the islands of the Aegean into a Provincia
Insular1nn3 but the Rhodians formed an
alliance with Rome as early as the war of
Attalus with Philip 111. (n.C. 197), in
which the Romans gave the King of Per-
gamum their help. Its celebrity for works
of art, statues and pffintings, surpassed
that of any other place. Miletus contri-
buted the finest woollen manufactures to
the luxury of Rome. The character of the
Tarentines was not less notorious than that
of their neighbours of Sybaris. Their life
was one holiday. Their calendar is said to
have contained more festivals than there
are days in the year. Sec note on Hor. S.
ii. 4. 34, “ molle Tarentum.” Elsewhere
he calls it ‘imbelle ' (Epp. i. 7. 45).

304. Quum bibitur eoneha‚] “ When
the drunken wretches pour the wine into
1110. 011 cup and drink out of that, and (lon’t
know the difference,'' which is F orcellini's
explanation. ‘ Concha. ' was a shell-shaped
vessel of various kinds, and used for various
purposes. Horace has ‘⁴ concha salis puri '’
(S. i. 3. 14), 01111 “ funde capacibus un-
guenta 110 conchis '’ (C. ii. 7. 22). Pliny
(H. N. xiii. 3) has some good remarks upon
the extravagant use of perfumes, which he
says are the most superfluous of all luxu-
ries, and adds, ‘⁴ At, hercule, jam quidam
etiam in potus addunt ; tantique amaritudo
est ut odore prodigo fruantur ex utraque
parte corporiS.'¹
