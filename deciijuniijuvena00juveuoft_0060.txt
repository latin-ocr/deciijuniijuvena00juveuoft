1). JUNII JUVENALIS

Quadrivio‚ quum jam sexta cervice feratur,

Hinc atque inde patens ac nuda paene cathedra

Et multum referens (10 Maecenate supine,
δίς-1111101· falso, qui se lautum atque beatum
Exiguis tabulis et gemma fecerat uda ’τ’
Occurrit matrona potens, quae molle Calenum

simply ‘ cerae.’ ‘ Quadrivia’ were the
erossings of two streets, ‘ compita? where
numbers of passengers would be found ; and
he says it is enough to make a man take out
his tablets in the public streets, to note the
shamcless proceedings of these people.

64. sarta cervice seratum] This thief was
carried in a ‘ cathedra? borne by six slaves,
¹ hexaphoron 3’ the sides were thrown open,
by the drawing back of the curtains by which
they were usually closed in. This represents
the impudence of the man, who ought to
'nave been ashamed to show his face, and
his laziness, in which he is said to look
very much like Maecenas. The character
of Maecenas, in this respect, is mentioned
in my note on Hor. S. i. 2. 25, ‘⁵ Maltinus
tunicis demissis ainbulat,'' where authorities
are quoted. See also below, S. xii. 39. ‘ Mul-
tum referens de Maecenate' is, literally,
‘ representing much of M aecenas.' So virgil
has “ Invalidique patrum referunt jejunia
nati ’⁵ (G. iii. 127). ‘ Supino' means 110 more
than lying lazingly on 1115 back. The ‘ cathe-
dra' was so constructed that the person half
reclined and half sat. In the ‘ lectica' he lay
at full length ; and in, the ‘ sella’ he sat up-
right, as 011 an arm-chair. ‘ Cathedrae’ were
chiefly used by women, and were considered
effeminate carriages for men. “ Cujus apud
molles minima est jactura cathedras '³ (vi.
91). Its shape and furuiture are described in
ix. 52 : “ Strata positus longaque cathedra.''
They were all carried by a single pole in
front, and another behind, resting 011 the
bearers' shoulders. The Indian ‘ tonjon’
represents the ‘ sella,' and in some instances
the ‘ cathedra?

67. Siynatorfalso,] This is the puuc-
tuation of most editions. Ruperti puts the
stop after ‘ signat0r,' which Madvig says is
right, or else Juvenal wrote ‘ signato falsos
which 1100110 I think will adopt (Op. i. 40).
¹ Signator falso' is one who has put forged
seals and signatures to a false will, or has
got knaves like himself to witness such a
will with him. A ‘ testamentum’ required
five witnesses, who put a seal and their
names 011 the 011151110- of it (see Dict. Ant.

‘ Testamentum’). The common way of
writing wills was on waxed tablets (exiguis
tabulis), whence come the expressions ‘ cera
p1·i1na‚' ‘secun(la,’ ‘ima,'(see Hor.S.ii.5.53,
n.). ‘ Gemma uda' is a 5031 moistened before
the im pressiori was made. ‘ Lautus' is ‘fine3'
and ‘beatus' ‘ well to do'(Hor. C.i. 4. 14‚n.).

69. molle Calenum] The wine of Cales
(Calvi) in Campania was among the best in
Horace’s time. It seems to have been one
of the milder wines, from this epithet. This
woman, who is represented as a person of
family (Ruperti says Agrippina is meant,
which Madvig (i. 40) rightly denies), J uve-
nal says, when she was going to hand her
husband some wine, mixed poison with it ς
and being well skilled in such matters,taught
her simpler neighbours how to get rid of
their husbands in the same way, and to carry
them out to their bnrial without any reg-ard
to the notoriety of the murder and the
crowds that collected to see the funeral. ‘Ru-
beta ' is a poisonous sort of toad (see below,
vi. 659). ‘Nigros' expresses the effect of the
poison on the dead body. The woman is
called ⁴ Locusta? after her who poisoned
Claudius by the direction of Agrippina, and
Britannicus by the order of Nero. See
Tacitus, Ann. xii. 663 xiii. 15. See 'also Sue—
tonius (Nero, 0. 33), who says she was hand-
5011101)ν rewarded for the latter of these mur-
ders. She was put to death by Galba, Nero’s
successor. The Scholiast on this place calls
her ‘ Lucusta‚' in 0110 version of his text3
and Jahn adopts that form. Valla's Scholiast
says that Nero employed her to teach him
her art, and many young women besides,
“ ut et illum doceret et plures puellas ;'' and
Suetonius says, he gave her “impunitatem
(she had been convieted ofwitchcraft) prae-
diaque ampla, scd et discipulos.’' The
Scholiast quotes two corrupt lines from Tur-
11115, the satirie poet, ‘thus amended by Valla:

‘⁶ Ex quo Caesareas soboles Locusta cecidit
Horrendmn, curas dum liberat atra Ne-
ronis.''

[Ribbeck places vv. 69, 70, 71, 72 between
v. 76 aud v. 77.]
