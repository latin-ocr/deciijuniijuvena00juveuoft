SATIRA Vll. ' 161

SATIRA VII.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms satiro turns on the neglect of literni-y men hythe rich. Pocts are left to starve or
get their bread by mcnial callings; historians nrc no better ost'; lawyers and school-
masters are put off with the shabbiest sees, and men will spcnd their money on any thing
rather than their sons' education. This is the most forcible and instructive part of the
satire, which describes the weary task of the schoolmaster, the little return of gratitudo
he getS, and the exacting demands of parents who expect every thing and will pay little
or nothing. The toacher who in the good old times, Juvenal says, was treated with pro-
found respect, iu his day was insulted by parents and therefore by pupils. If the boy is
a blockhead and cannot learn the master gets au the blame.

 

culpa docentis
Scilicet arguitur si laeva in parte mamillae
Nil salit Arcadio juveni.'' (vii. 158.)

The only patron learned men have, says Juvenal, is the emperor, and it has been much
quaetioned which emperor it could have been. The statement is most in accordance with
what we hear of the reign of Hadrian, during which he managed to encourage the arts
and literature at Rome, though he was absent the greater part of his time. The subject
is discussed in the Life of Juvenal, to which the reader is referred.

ARGUMENT.

The hope and purpose of our studies is in Caesar only. He only cares for the
Muses in these times when poets leave the vales of Helicon and live by baths‚ by
baking, auctioneering. For if Pierian woods won't give you bread, you must e’en ply
the crier’s trade in the Atria. And this is better than to lie in the courts, though
knights of Asia and Bithynia do it.

V. 16—35. But this is past ς no poet now shall be degraded to do dirty work. Up and
bestir youraelves, my friends 5 the prince is secking whom he may reward. If you
are waiting for another patron, go put your books in the fire or leave them to the
worms: go break your pens and wipe out all your lines 3 the rich have learnt to
admire and praise you, as children do the peacoek. But the useful years of life are
passing, and when old age comes on with weariness and poverty, it hates itself and
its own Muse.

V. 36—47. This is the way the man you worship, leaving the Muses and Apollo’s temple,
contrives to give you nothing. Being himself a poet (equal to Homer save in years),
if you're ambitious to recite your poenis he lends you a dirty room a long way off,
bolted for years as safe as the gates of a beleaguered town : he sends his freedmen to
applaud; but he'll not give as much as the benches eost to hire.

V. 48—97. And yet we go on at this work, ploughing the sands laboriously. If you
should give it up, the old habit pulls you back3 for with too many the itch of writing
is incurable and goes on to old age in their weary hearts. But a rare poet, noue of
your common sort, such as 1 only can conceive not name, is made so by a careless
mind, free from all bitterness, loving the woods and Muses' springs. ’Tis not for
poverty to sing in caves and wield the thyrsus· Horatius was fun when he cried
Euoe! What room for genius if other cares than his own verse disturb the poet’s
