LIFE OF PERSIUS. xxvii

Annaeus Cornutus, a philosopher of the Stoic school, to which most
meu of thought at. that time belonged. To Cornutus hc became much
attached, aud the friendship continued to the end of his life. llis obli-
gations to this excellent man he feclingly acknowledgcs in the fifth
Satire. thilc he was at school hc appears to have written a comcdy;
also a poem, probably of a humorous cast, which he called Ὁδοιπορικά,
Wayside Vei-ses, or The Travellcr, or whatever it may have been, and
some verses on the death of his kinswoman Arria. She was the wife of
Caecina Paetus, who for treason was put to death by Claudius. The
allusion in the life is to her conduct on this occasion. Paetus was
required to be his own executioner. His wife, who loved him devotedly
and had declared she would die with hini, took a dagger, stabbed herself,
drew it out, and handed it to her husband, and said, “ Paetus, it is not
painful ⁵.’' This happened A.1). 42, before Persius was eight years old.
These early productions his mother kept till her death, and then, by the
judicious advice of Cornutus, destroyed them.

How soon after his father's death his mother married again, it is im-
possible to say. But that she remained with her two children, Aulus
and his sister, at Volaterrae, till the boy was old enough to go to Rome,
and that she continued to superintend his education till he went to
Cornutus, may be assumed. The Scholiast, on S. vi. 6, says that after
the death of her first husband she married in Liguria, where Persius was
staying when that Satire was written. It is more likely that she retired
to this part of the country, to a house left her by her second husband,
after his death, leaving her son to pursue his studies under the guidance
and roof of Cornutus ⁶.

At this time he formed an intimate acquaintance with that Caesius
Bassus to whom the last Satire is addressed‚ and with Calpurnius Sura,
of whom however we know nothing more than the Grammarian tells us,
that he died young, and that Persius survived him.

⁵ See Pliny, Epp. iii. 16. Martial (i. 14) has an epigram on this event:

“ Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto,
Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,
⁴ Si qua fides vulnus quod feci non dolet,' inquit,
‘ Sed quod tu facies hoc mihi, Paete, dolet.' ”

⁶ From Persius' way of speaking of Lunae Portus it has been supposed by some that
he was born there. But independently of the express testimony of the Grammariun,
there is presumptive evidence in the name of Sisennia, which is Etrurian, and in Arria
his kinswoman having married Caecina, whose family were natives of Volaterrae, to con-
firm the statement that Persius was born there. There is of course no weight to bc
attached to the tradition which is mentioned only, as fau· as 1 know, in Bayle's notice of
Persius in his Dictionary, that a medem family of Volterra (the Falconcini) are derived
from Persius’ father, who had but one son, and he ‹lied unmarried. From the same
source I leam thata house was shown a century ago at Volterra as that of Persius.
