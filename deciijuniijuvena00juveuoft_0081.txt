quam gemmas quoniam est summa commen-
datio in longitudine.'' ‘Tu ' is addressed to
any unmarried woman, and is a common
way of speaking, as in Horace (Epp. i. 2.
62) : “ animum rege qui nisi paret Imperat ς
hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catena.”

52. De nohispost haec] ‘And yet after
this, harsh verdict is passed upon us women3
so does judgment spare the raven and hunt
down the dove.’ The last example is not
very dove—like. ‘ Sententiam ferre ' is more
properly derived from the senate than the
‘judicia,’ where the ‘ judiees ’ were said
¹ sententiam dicere’ or ‘pronuntiare.’ In
‘censura' Heinrich sees an allusion to Do-
mitian's censorship.

64. canentem Stoicidae] See note on v.
10. ‘ Trepidi' means ‘ in confusion! See
note on Hor. C. ii. 11. 4. The indignant
language of the woman is expressed by ‘ ca-
nentem.' It would apply to Cassandra or
any one of that sort. ‘ Stoicidae’ is only a
contemptuous form of ‘Stoici.’ The Scho-
liast makes it feminine, and compares it
with “O vere Phrygiae nec dum Phryges”
(Virg. Aen. ix. 617), and with ⁶ Troiades' in
Persium. 4. But the form is masculine, asin
Hor. S. i.1.100‚ ‘fortissima Tyndaridarum?

66. quum tu multicia sumas,] The Satire
now turns to those who, while they affected
the Stoic opinions and character openly.
practised vice in secret. The ‘ multicia'
were garments of some fine transparent
texture, such as the ‘ Coae vestes' mentioned
by Horace, C. iv. 13. 13, and S. i. 2. 101 :
“Cois tibi paene videre est Ut nudum.”
See below v. 78, and xi. 188. Also vi. 259:
‘⁸ Hae sunt quae tenui sudant in cyclade‚”
and viii. 101 ε “ conchylia Coa.’' ‘ Creticus’
is a. name put for any person of station, as
the Scholiast says. It occurs again in
viii. 38. ‘ Pei-orare ' is often used by Cicero,
not only for the conclusion of a speech, but
sor the speech itself, as Forcellini shows.

Juvenal says ‘the man goes and harangues
the people against lewd women while he
is wearing these lewd garments and the
people are admiring them. ‘ Proculae '
is a name that occurs in inscriptions. ‘ Pol-
litas’ appears in various shapes 111 the MSS.
For ίκ’111)1111·(1,’ which is the reading of P.
and occurs in Martial, i. 65 ; xii. 94, a large
number of MSS. have ‘ Labulla.' The edi-
tions are divided. ‘ Carfinia ¹ also appears
as* ‘ Carphinia,' ‘Calphurnia,' and other
forms. Thesclast represent married women,
who if convicted of adultery would be
obliged to put off the stola, which was the
honest matron’s ordinary dress, and to wear
a toga, which was the dress of a ‘mereti-ix)
See Hor. S. i. 2. 63, n. Ruperti says Juvenal
(locs not allude here to this. I think he
does,

70. Sed Julius ardet‚] Creticus is sup-
posed to answer, in excuse for his gai-ments,
that in this hot weather his blood boils. He
is told that he had better go into court
naked at once, for though the people would
call him mad, madness was not so disgrace-
sulas indccency. ‘ Nudus’ was said ofone
who appeared only in his tunic. See Cicero,
Phil. ii. 86: “ Ο praeclaram illam eloquen-
tiam tuam quum cs nudus contionatus!
quid hoc turpius? quid foedius P quid sup-
pliciis omnibus digniuS‚” by which and like
passages Heinrich supports the reading·
‘ infamia’ instead of ‘ insaniass which is that
of most MSS. and all editions hut his own
and Grangaeus’, who says, “ albis dentibus
ridendi qui legunt insania pro infamia.’'

72. En habitum] Ruperti conjectures
‘me ’ for ‘te‚’ and supposes Creticus to
speak what follow, which he says is “ diffi-
cillimus locus.” lt appears to me pretty
plain. Heinecke's interpretation given by
Ruperti seems equally with his beside
the mark. Juvenal sayS, “ See the
dress in which the citizens just returned
