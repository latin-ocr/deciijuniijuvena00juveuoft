Quis timet aut timuit gelida Praeneste ruinam,

made themselves eomfortable for life. (See
Dict. Ant. art. ‘ Se1·vus.') Holyday’s vcr-
sion, which Mr. Mayor adopts, is uncouth
and quite wrong. ‘ Cultis' means pampered,
or something of that sort, not ‘ amatis,’ as
Ruperti says.

190. 90Ιίάο Praeneste meinana] Prae-
neste (Palestrina) was twenty-three miles
east of Rome, 011 the edge of the Apennines.
Virgil calls it ¹ altum Praeneste ε’

“Quique altum Praeneste viri, quique arva
Gabinae
J unonis gelidumque Anienem et roscida
rxvxs

Hernica saxa colunt.” (Aen. vii. 682.)

Horace calls it ‘ frigidum Praeneste,’ C. iii.
4. 22, and it was a place he sometimes re-
sorted to. See note on Epp. i. 2. 2, for
further particularS. lt was a resort also of
Augustus (Sueton. Vit. Aug. 72. 82). Juve-
nal refers to it again (xiv. 88) as a favourite
place of resort. Virgil and Horace (above),
and all other writers, use Praeneste in the
neuter gender, but in Aen. viii. 361 Virgil
has “Praeneste sub ipsa,’' where, as here, it
15 feminine. Servius draws attention to
this. Forcellini says that in using the femi-
nine adjective Virgil ‘⁴ ad urbem respexit.’'
The termination is no doubt neuter.

Gabii is repeatedly mentioned by Horace:
as a deserted town (Epp. i. 11. 7) ι “ Seis
Lebedus quid sit, Gabiis desertior atque
Fidenis ;” as a place for cold bathing (Epp.
i. 15. 8, sq.) :

‘⁶ Qui caput et stomachum supponere fonti-
bus audent
Clusinis, Gabiosque petunt et frigida
rura.”

He also refers to its early history in con-
nexion with the Tarquinii (Epp. ii. 1. 24) :
“ foedera regum Vel Gabiis vel cum rigidis
aequata Sabinis.’' (See note on Epp. i. 11.
7.) It was a ‘ municipium‚’ and though a
place of no importance now when Juvenal
wrote, it had been in early times, and was
restored by the emperors Antoninus and
Commodus It lay on the Via Praenestina,
midway between Rome and Praeneste, and
was therefore probably the place where Au-

gustus passed the night on his journey to
P r· ieiieste, 11 111011 Such onius (l. c. ) says took
him two days. Juvenal mentions it as a
place for bathing, vii. 4; and as the type of
sm 111 country tow 115, x. 100. Ηο here calls
it‘ simplices,' ‘unsophisticated·' , but this
was compared with Rome. He implies that
it was as bad as other towns in some re-
spects in S. vi. 55.

Volsinii, which retains its name under
the form of Bolsena, was an important city
of Etruria, situated at the foot of the hills
above the lake that was called after it, and
is still called after the modern town, Lago
di Bolsena. It stood on the Via Cassia,
seventy—two miles from Rome and thirty
south of Clusium, according to the Itinerary
ofAntoninus. The ancient town was si'tuated
on the top of one of the hills, which appear
to have been covered with wood, but that
was destroyed by the Romans, A.U.C. 474.
It seems from this passage to have become a
resort of the Romans, like many other towns
of Etruria 3 and it was the birth-place of
Sejanus, as we learn from Tacitus (Ann.
iv. 1).

Tibur (Tivoli), which was sixteen miles
from Rome, on the banks of the Anio, is
here called ‘ pronum,’ and by Horace ‘ supi-
num ³ (C. iii. 4. 23), because it was situated
on the slope of a hill. ‘Arx' was commonly
used for a town so built, though the citadel
was gone or had never existed, or for a hill
on which 110 town was built at all. See Hor.
C. ii. 6. 22: ‘⁶ Ille te meeum locus et beatae
Postul· ant arces? ’It contains the same root
as ἕρκος, andis properly therefore a fortified
place. ‘Tiburis ar ee' is repeated' in xiv. 87.

193. tenui tilieine fultam] ‘Tibicen’
is a buttiess. Festus says itis 50 called
because it supports houses as the flute-
player sustains the singer, which Forcellini
quotes or it would not be worth noticing.

194. sic labentibus obstat Villicus] ‘ Sic’
may mean ‘ as you see,' δεικτικῶς, whether
it be taken with ‘ labentibus' or ‘ obstat‚’
or ‘ 111 this way,’ that is, with buttresses, if
it is connected with ¹ obstat.' ‘ Villicus,’
which properly signified the steward of a
farm, was applied to the superintendent of
any other works. Forcellini showshow it
