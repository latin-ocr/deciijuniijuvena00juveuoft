SATIRA VIII. 1⁵59

a crookod girl Europa, a ninngy dog a pnrd, a tiger, 01 a lion. So you 11101 better
not ntl‘ect [1110111 names.

Υ. 39. This is for you, Rubellius Plautus, swelling with your (10500111 from Drusus, 115
isit were a inerit os your own that you were 110111 not of a poor westver but of the
great Iulus’ blood. ¹· Low wretehes (say you), ye who cannot tell your fathers·
birthpluce. 1 am a son of Cecrops! ’' Long may you live to enjoy your birth 1 But
in that low rubble you will tind 11 1111111 01“ eloquence, who shall defend ,501110 noble
blockhead, or solve the riddles of the luw; and some brnve soldiers too ; while you are
all Cecropinn, as 0501055 115 11 Ηο111105; the only dillbrence is his head‘s of marble,
yours has life in it. Tell me, O 'frojam who connts animals noble except they’rc
bmve? we praise a horse for speed who has won many races easily. Wherever 110
was reared we eall him noble who 1101115 1110 1051, while a 111010 110111 to be put up und
sold are the best bred if they but 50111001 wiu. There we have no respect for
11000511)ν z they sell for little and go to draw a cart or grind a mill. So tell mc some-
thing of your own to engi-ave upon your bust, besides the honours that we freely
give to those to whom you owe all that you have.

V. 71. Enough for him, who lacking common sense (rare in that state of life) is puss'ed
with his relationship to Nem. But you, my friend, 1 would not have you valued
upon the merits of your family, and you yourself do nothing for future time to praise.
’Tis poor to rest upon unother’s fame ς remove the pillarand the roof falls in ς robbed
of its elm the vine eomes to the ground. Be a good soldier, honest guardian, upright
judge, witness iuflexible, count not your life before your character, your life before
the cause for which you live. T hat man deserves to die, though he fare sumptuously
and smell of all perfumes.

V. 87. When you have got the province that you look for, put reins upon your temper
and desires ; pity the poor natives; the princes you will see have all the marrow
sucked from out their bones. Think of the lawS, the trust committed 10 you, the
honours that await the good, the fate of those who were condemned for robbing the
Cilicians. Not that such condemnation is worth much, when one takes what another
leaves. Go, get an anctioneer to sell your clothes, Chaerippus, and straight say
nothing; it were mere maduess to throw away your fare besides. Those people
suffered less when they were beaten first: riches were left them still, shawls and
dresses, pictures and statues, and chased silver vessels ς then came your governors
aud carried off more spoils from peace than ever graced a triumph. Now the little
that they bave they'll lose it all. You may despise perhaps the Rhodians and Corinth
too; but take good care of Spain, of Gaul, Illyricum, the Africans who send us corn
to feed our idleness. Besides they've nothing to repay you, Marius has robbed them.
Take care you do no great wrong to the brave and poor: take all they have, you
still will leave them arms.

V. 125. This is no saw ς believe the Sibyl speakS. Be your attendants righteous, no
favourite sell your judgments, your wife no harpy, then you may trace your birth to
Picus and the Titan brood, and claim Prometheus for your ancestor. But if ambition,
lust, and cruelty carry you headlong, then your ancestors only hold up the torch to
expose your shame. The sin is greatest in the greatest sinuer. Why boast yourself
to me, you who forge wills in temples which your grandsire built, before your father's
statue, and steal by night to an adulterous bed Ρ

V. 147. Fat consul Lateranus drives his coach right past the ashes of his sires by night,
but the moon and stars look on, and when his consulship is (10110 he’ll do it in broad
day and meet his aged friend without a blush. He'll do grooms' work, and when he
goes to sacrifice to Jove he'll swear by Epona and stablc gods· And when he goes to
111νο105 1110 greasy host comes out to meet him, and with an air salutes his lordship ς
while the officious hostess brings the wine.
