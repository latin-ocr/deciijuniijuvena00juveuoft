A. PERSII FLACCI

Cum pipere et palmis venit nostrum hoe maris expers,

Foeniseeae crasso vitiarunt unguine pultes”

Haec cinere ulterior metuas?

At tu, meus heres,

Quisquis eris, paulum a turba seductior audi.
O bone, num ignoras? missa est a Caesare laurus
Insignem ob cladem Germanae pubis, et aris

some Greek wines ; and Heinrich supposes
that Persius means ‘salis expers,’ ‘insul-
sum.’ This is an ingenious solution of the
difficulty. So it would be this ‘witless,
silly taste of oursss The expression would
be far-fetehed; but Ι think, though it
would not have occurred to the writer
himself, it is not improbable he may have
thus applied it. Jahn, taking Horaee's
meaning in the same sense, follows close
upon Hcinrich’s interpretation. But he
takes the sense to be ‘corrnptss that is,
wanting in that salt which preserves all
things from corruption. The other inter-
pretation of Horace’s meaning is, that the
wine had never erossed the seaS, and so
some. interpreters take this place as a taste
of home growth. This is the interpretation
of Turnebus (Adv. 30. 7), and of Meister,
who has written a treatise 011 this passage.
(Ueber A. Persii S. vi. 37—40. Leipzig,
1810.) The words as they stand in the
text will not bear this meaning, and to sus-
tain it the critics separate ‘nostruin hoc
maris expers' from what goes before. When
I wrote my note 011 Horace (1. c.) I thought
this was the meaning of Persius and of
Horace. But 011 farther reflection I do not
think it is, but that ‘ maris expers ¹ here
means ‘ without salt ⁹ (wit), as there it is
‘ without salt water?

40. Foeniseeae crasso]
is the inore common form.
‘ mowers! He uses it generally for country
lahonrers, as he uses ‘fossor' (V. 122 .
Heinrich and Jahn have ‘ae ³ in the first
syllable on the authority of the MSS.
Orelli has ‘ oe,’ and Foreellini says that is
the right diphthong. ‘Unguine’ herc is
like ‘ uncto’ in 16. Horace has ‘ crassum
unguentuin’ (A. P. 375); but he means
pei-fumes, Here coarse 011 is meant for
inixing with the porridge 3 as to which see
Juv. xiV. 171, ‘⁶ grandes fumabant pultibus
ollae.''

41. Haec cinere ulterior metuas ἲ] The
poet drops his irony and asks in scorn,
‘Are you to fear such stuff as this when
you are deadP' We say ‘beyond the
grave 3' Persius says ‘beyond the burniug.'

‘ Foenisices ³
It means

He theu by way of showing his own mind
in this matter, turns and addresses his
‘heres,' and asks for a word in his ear.
By ‘meus heres' he means his ‘ heres legi-
timus,' who would suceeed to his property
in the event ofhis dying intestate, and who
might probably expect to be named ‘heres'
if he made a will. Persius so far identifies
himself with his subject that he assumes
the speaker to have no ‘ sui heredes’ (J uv.
x. 237), Persius having no children or wife
himself.

43. O bone, num {qnoras ἲ] ‘My good
friend, haven't you heard ’θ’ as the doctor
says, “ Heus, bone, tu palles '³ (iii. 94).
Caesar has sent tidings of a great victory
over the Ger-maim, and arrangements are
being made for a grand celebration: he
therefore intends to offer a hundred pairs
of gladiator-s, and asks who shall prevent
him. The Caesar he means is Caligula,
whose ridiculous pretence of an expedition
against the Germans, B.c. 40, is related by
Suetonius (Caligula, 43, sqq.). Tacitus
speaks of it and. a pretended expedition
against Britain as “ Gaianarum expeditio-
num ludibrium” (Hist. iv. 15). His object
was plunder, of which he was insatia-te.
The son of Cunobellinus, a British king,
flyiug from his father, came to Caligula
and surrendered himself, which the Em-
peror considered as a cession of the island,
and thereupon sent a flaming letter to
announce the fact to the Senate. After-
wards he got up a sham engagement in a
wood by the Rhine, sending some German
prisoners across the river to represent the
enemy, who were then reported as coming
down in great force. He marched his
army down to the sea-shore, and when they
got there ordered them to pick up shells as
spoils of the ocean, to be dedicated in the
Capitol and Palatium, and built a light-
house to commemorate this victory. »Ηο
then made arrangements for a triumph on
a magnificent scale, for which he ordered
contributions to be collected from every
quarter. As to ‘ laurus,' see note on J uv.
iv. 149, “ venisset epistola penna.”
