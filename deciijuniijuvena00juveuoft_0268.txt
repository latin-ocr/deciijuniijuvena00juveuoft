D. JUNII J UVENALIS

Pacis, et advectae secreta palatia Matris,

Et Cererem (nam quo non prostat femina templo Ρ)
Νο1101· Aufidio moechus celebrare solebas,

Quodque taces, ipsos ctiam inclinare maritos,

Utile et hoe multis vitae gcnus3 at mihi nullum
Inde operae pretium. Pingues aliquando lacernas,
Tvlunimenta togae, duri crassique eoloris,

Et male percussas textoris pectine Galli

Accipimus, tenue argentum venaeque secundae.

Fata regunt homines 3 fatum cst et partibus illis
Quas 5111115 abscondit. Nam si tibi sidera cessant,
Nil saciet longi mensura incognita nervi,

Quamvis te nudum spumanti Virro labello

Viderit et blandae assidue densaeque tabellae
Sollicitent3 αὐτὸς Ὑὰρ ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα κίναιδος.
Quod tamen ulterius monstrum quam mollis avarus?

“Ut nuper, actus cum freto Neptunius
Dux fugit ustis navibus.''

where ‘nuper' means six years before.

24. quo aon prostat] See note on S. vi.
489: “Aut apud Isiacae potius sacraria
lenae.'' There were statues 01“ Ganymedes
in the temples of Jupiter, which are meant
here. The temple of Pax, which gave its
name to the fourth region of the city, was
built by Vespasian after the destruction of
Jerusalem in what was previously called
the Sacra Via. The temple of Cybele 110
calls ⁵ palatia.' It was 011 Mons Palatinus.
See note 011 S. ii. 111 aud iii. 137, where
the reason of her being called ‘ advectae:
imported, is explained. Aufidius must
have been some notorious profligate.
‘Celebrare’ is ‘tof1·cquent.' P. has ‘scele-
rare‚' which Jahn [and Ribbeck] have
taken into the text. Heinrich says it is a
good word, but not suited to this place.
‘Ineliuare’ is used iu an obscene sense
here and x. 224.

27. Utile ez} 7100 multis] The man
answers that this filthy trade had not
been profitable to him: that while his
master, Virro, had exacted from him his
full amount of labour, he sometimes got a
coarse cloak of bad material, like base
metal, as a present for his panis, and that
was all. As to ‘ lacerna ’ see i. 27, n., and
Persius i. 54. Coarse textures, it appears,
were imported from some parts of Gallia.

See S. viii. 145. Martial sends a friend a
cloak which 110 calls “ Sequanicae pinguem
textricis alumnam'' (iv. 19). Elsewhere
he says to a rich friend, “Te Cadmea Tyros,
me pinguis Gallia vestit.” ‘ vPecten ’ was
a comb, the teeth of which were inserted
between the threads of the warp to force
the thrcads of the woof close together
(500 Dict. Ant„ ‘Tela ³). For this insertion
of the ‘pecten ' ‘ percutere’ was the
teclmical term. [Ribbeck omits v. 29.]

33. .ςί tibi sidera cessant,] If your stars
are not lucky, if they are behindhand as
we sometimes say. He moralizes on his
own ill luck. The whole of the frout folds
of the toga was called ‘sinus,' though it
generally was applied to the part that went
over the hrcast.

37. αὐτὸς ’γὰρ ἐφέλκεται] This is a pa·
rody of Homer (Odyss. xvi. 294): αὐτὸς
’γὰο ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα σίδηρος, 1110 very
sight of steel draws the soldier to it. It is
a proverbial way of speaking, and occurs
again in the Odyssey (xix. 13).

38. mollis 0111111182] ‘An effeminate if
he be a miser? See above, v. 16, 11. He
complains how his master calculated the
eost, how much he had given him, and
how much he had done for it. ‘An facile’
&c. 15 1115 reply. The expression ‘ponatur
caleulus' is taken from placing stenes in
the ‘abacus 3' which mode of calculating
is explained with an engraving in Dict.
Ant„ art. ‘Abacus.' There were ‘calcula-
