D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Bal-bato, nondum Graccis jurare paratis

Per caput alterius, quum3furem nemo timeret
Caulibus aut pomis ct aperto viveret horto,
Paullatim deinde ad superos Astraea recessit

Hac comite, atque duae pariter fugere sorores,

20

Antiquum et vetus est alienum, Postume, lectum
Concutcre atque sacri Genium contemnere fulcri.
Omne aliud crimen mox ferrea protulit aetas3
Viderunt primos argentea secula moechos.

Conventum tamen et pactum et sponsalia nostra

expresses a great deal. M. and some other
MSS„ as well as the editio princeps and
many of the old editions, have ‘exstite-
rant?

16. Graecis jurare paratis] He bada
contempt for the Greeks of his day, as we
see in S. iii. 58, sqq. He means before men
began to perjure themselves. To swear by
the head of their father οι· others, or by
that of the person addressed, was common
with Greeks and Romans. The Jews were
reproved for the same by our Saviour.

18. Caulibus aut pomis et aperto] The
MSS. vary between ‘ aut: ‘ ac,' and ‘ et,’ be-
fore ‘ pomis? ‘Aut ' is the reading of most
old editions, but does not appear in many
MSS. M. has it, and I think it is right.
For ‘et aperto' Henninius adopts a conjec-
ture of Barthius, who (Adv. xxii. 7) says,
“ malim sed aperto.'' He gives no reason.
The common reading is right, as may be
seen by referring to the note on Horace, S.
i. 1. 3, where this sortof construction is ex-
plained. The passage runs,

“ Qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo, quam sibi
Seiioiiietlss dederit, seu fors objecerit, illa
Οοὲΐξιέξξιε vivat3 laudet diversa sequen-

‘Nemo timeret ' is equal to ‘quisque non
timeret τ’ the implied ‘ quisque' is the sub-
ject of ‘viveret,' and ‘et' is the natural
copula. Ruperti's note on the various
readings contradicts his commentary, and
his conjecture ‘et operto' “quo omnis
difficultas tollitur ’' supposes a difficulty
which does not exist.

19. Astraea] She was reputed to be the
daughter of Zeus and Themis. The Ro-
mans looked upon her as the representative
ofJustiee (παρθένος Δικαιοσύνη ὡς ’Ῑουβενοί-
λιος is a gloss quoted by Jahn). When
Astraea left the earth for its crimes, she

25

was translated to the skies as the constel-
lation Virgo. ‘ Hac ’ is Pudicitia, and she
and Astraea are the ‘duae sorores.' An old
scholium in the MS. of Barthius says,
“ Duae sorores sunt Pietas et Fides ''
(Cramer, p. 598). Pudor and J ustitia are
joined together by Horace (C. i. 24. 6),
but Fides is there called sister of J ustitia,
who corresponds to Hesiod's Nemesis : ἀθα-
νάτων μετὰ φῦλον ἴτον προλιπόντ’ ἀνθρώ-
πους Αἰδὼς καὶ Νέμεσις. Op. et Di. 199.
(See below, xi. 55: “morantur Pauci ridi-
culum fugientem ex urbe Pudorem.'')

Ovid makes Astraea leave the earth in
the fourth or iron age, Met. i. 149 ι

“Victa jacet pietas, et Virgo caede ma-
milieissgseaelestum terras Astraea reli-
qu1 .‘'

22. Genium contemnere fulcri] ‘Ful-
crum‚' which is a bedpost, is used for the
bed again in xi. 95, and in Propertius, iv.
7. 3: “Cynthia namque meo visa est in-
cumbere fulcro.'' ‘ Lectus genialis' is
explained on Horace, Epp. i. 1. 87, and
7. 94. It is spoken of below, x. 334. Every
man had his Genius, which was associated
with him from his birth, and formed (as
there said) his spiritual identity. Forcel-'
lini thinks from this verse that a figure
of the man’s Genius was usually cal-ved on
his marriage-bed. The order of the verses
21-24 has troubled some critics. Schrader
would transpose 24 and 23, Ruperti would
put these two after 20. Heinecke thinks
24 spuriouS, being only a repetition. The
sense is plain as given in the argument.
Heinrich did not miss it, audit is wonder-
ful that any one should.

25. Conveniunt tamen et pactum] ‘Con-
ventiones’ and ‘pacta’ are general terms
for contracts and agreements, the different
natures of which are stated in Long's Ar-
