Herodis venere dies, unctaque fenestra

A. PERSII FLACCI

180

Dispositae pinguem nebulam vomuere lucernae
Portantes violas, rubrumque amplexa catinum
Cauda natat thunni, tumet alba fidelia vino ;
Labra moves tacitus recutitaque sabbata palles.

Tunc nigri lemures ovoque pericula rupto,

Tunc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos

Incussere deos inflantes corpora, si 11011

Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.
Dixeris 11300 inter varicosos Centuriones,

Apollo with the help of torches3 λύχνον
’γὰρ οὐδέπω δῆλον ὅτι πρόσθεν ἑωράκασιν
οἱ τὰς τοσαύτας καὶ τηλίκαύτας λυχνο-
nasus ἐπιτελοῦντες. The windows Persius
speaks of as anointed with 011, and the
lamps crowned with violets. See Juv. xii.
89, sqq. ‘ Rubrum catinum ³ is a dish of
red clay, and most of the Italian pottery
was of that colonr. ‘ Fidelia ' occurs twice
in S. iii. vv. 22, 73. ‘ Labra moves taci-
tus' is an imitation of Horace's “Labra
movet metuens audiri '³ (Epp. i. 16. 60).
See notes on S. ii. 3 111111 011 Juvenal xiv.

“Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbata pa-
trem
Nil praeter nubes et caeli numen ado-
rant.”

Persius means that the 1111111 at these Jewish
festivals adopts their way of praying in
silence, of which Tacitus says “Judaci
mente sola unumque numen intelligunt '³
(Hist. v. 5). Persius adds that the man
stands in awe of the sabbath. to which 110
transfers the epithet that belongs to the
Jews themselves. As to these supersti-
tious see, besides the above passage of
Juvenal, vi. 159, 11. 542, n.

185. Tunc niyri lemures] Lemures
and Larvae were spirits of the bad, as
Manes and Lares were of the good. See
note 011 Ηο1·. Epp. ii. 2. 209, “Nocturnos
lemures portentaque Thessala rides?’'
The Scholiast explains the dangers of the
broken egg. He says that eggs were put
by the priests 011 the fire to roast, and if
one broke it porteuded mischief to him for
whom the trial was made, or to his pro-
perty. There were various superstitious
about eggs, such as that as soon as the in-
side was eaten the 5110011 should be thrust
through the shell. Witehes used them in
their incantations. Livia is said to have

ascertained by hatching a hen's egg by
artifieial means, and its producing a cock,
that the child of which she was 111-08113111
would be 3 boy (Sueten. Tib. 14. Plin.
H. N. x. 55). Eggs were used for other
superstitious purposes (see Pluui's note).
186. Tunc φ’(ιηᾱεε Galli] These are the
priests of Cybele. ‘ Tunc—tunc ' are ‘ now
one 111111 now the other? See notes on J uv.
S. ii. 1113 vi. 511. fGrandes Galli' eor-
responds to the ‘ingens Semivir' of the
latter passage. As to ‘sistrum’ see 11010
011 J uv. xiii. 93, and Wsskinson’s Aue.
Egypt. vol. ii. p. 322, sqq. ‘ Lusca sacer-
dos' is here 1110 priestess of Isis, to whom
this instrument particularly belonged, and
with it she struck blind those with whom

she was angry, as Juvenal says (l. c.), “ Isis
et irato feriat mea lumina sistro.” The
priestess is therefore called ‘ lusca? She

may be supposed to have had a touch of
the goddess' ‘sistrum.'

187. Incussere deos inflantes corpora,]
The influences usually attributed to Isis
are here assigned to the several causes
named. ‘The gods that swell out men's
bodies ³ is only 3 way of expressing their
various diseases sent by the gods. “Et 1
phthisis et vomicae putres,” as Juvenal ἐ
says in a similar connexion (l. e.). Turne· ³
bus (Adv. xviii. 12, quoted by Plum) has
some remarks about the superstitious use
of garlic, but they 1111011γ 110 light on this 1
place. It is enough that the Egyptians ¹
held this herb 111 particular reverence, and
it may be assumed, in the absence of in-
formation, that the ceremony of eating a
head of garlic three times in the morning
(three successive mornings, as it seems),
was invented by Persius for this occasion.

189. Diaeeris haec· inter] This is the
common construction for ‘ suppose you tell
it? See note on Hor. S. i. 1. 45. ‘ Haec’
means all thaso bas beel) said about liberty·'
