theu. you must allow, knew not what he should usk : sor he who pruycd for too much
power did only huild himself a towcr to full the sal-ther srom. What ruincd Crassus,
Caesar, and Pompeius? The rank they sought by every art, and gods too prone to
listen to their prayers. ch kiugs aud tyrants die a natural death.

v.114. Boys pruy Minerva for Demostheues' or Cicero‘s eloquencc, aud yet 'twas
this that killed them. ’l'was Genius that lost its head and hands. Small plcadcrs
never dyed the Rostra with their blood. Had he writ all as he wrote poetry, then
Cicero might have mocked Antonius’ swords. I'd rather he the author of his poeuis
than of his famous speech. A crucl death was his too who held thc reins of the full
theatre before admiring Atheus, whom with bad omens born his father scut to school
from the sorge.

V. 133. Τ110 spoils of war some count the height of human happiness: sor this do all
great captaius ronse themselves. 'l‘he thirst for fame is greater than for virtue: for
take away her honours who would love her? The glory of a few then, thirsting for
epitaphs to be inscribed upon their tomb till the fig splits it, has wrecked their
country : tombs themselves nmst perish.

V. 147. Weigh Hannibal: how many pouuds iu that great general, whom Africa could
not hold? He wius Hispania, leaps across the PyreneOS‚ and splits the Alps with
vinegar. Now he’s in Italy5 that's not enongh; he counts it nothing till he plants
his flagin the st-reets of Rome. A glorious picture that, the one-eyed captain on his
elephant! What was the issue then? O glory! 110 himself is beaten, sent into
exile, and there sits at the king's door till he be pleased to wake. The soul that shook
the world a ring laid low. Go, fool, and scale the Alps, that boys may learu to
wonder and declaim.

V. 168. For Pella’s boy one world was not enough : its narrow limits were to him as
Gyarus or Seriphus: yet when he came to Babylon a coffin satisfied him. Death
reveals how small we little men are.

V. 174. The credulous believe that Xerxes cut through Athos and all the lies of
Greek historians: he bridged the sea and drank up rivers, flogged the winds and
chained the Enrth-shaker-how merciful not to have brauded him! Sure any of the
gods would be his slave! But how did he get back from Salamis Ρ Why with one
ship through seas choked with the corpses of his men. This was the penalty his glory'
found.

V, 189. “Give me long life, Ο Jove, and many years !'' So unabashed and eagerly
you pray. But age is full of ills : an ugly face, tough skin, cheeks flabby, wrinkles like
a monkey. In youth there's some variety, old men are all alike : with trembling voice
and limbs, bald head and running nose, and toothless gumS, a bui-den to themselves and
all about them. His taste is gone, of meat and drink 1 mean, for as to pleasure of
another sort, that he has long forgot. The finest music gives him no enjoyment. What
matter where he sits at the theatro Ρ He cannot hear the very horns and trumpets.
His slave must bawl when visitors are Ι«1111100110οἀ or when he tells him what's o'clock.
The blood runs cold and scanty in his veins. A troop of all diseases dances round him :
so numerous Ι could sooner reekon Hippia's lovers, Themison's victims, all the part-
ners Basilus has cheated and all the wards Hirrus has rohbed, how many villas my
old barber has. One has the rheumatism, one the lumbago, one sciatica : this one is
blind, that one is fed by othei-53 he who would grin once at the sight of dinner, now
gapes like a young swallow for his food. But worst of all is dotage that forgets its
servants, friends, and children ε makes a will and gives its money to a hai-lot. But
though he keeps his senses he must see his friends all dying round him. This is the
penalty of age, to pass its days in mouruing for the dead.
