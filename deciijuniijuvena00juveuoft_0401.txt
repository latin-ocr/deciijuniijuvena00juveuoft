8.le RA XV.

Quem summa caeli raptum de parte Prometheus
Elemento gratulor et te
Sed qui mordere cadaver

Donavit terris.
Exsultare reor.

Sustinuit nil unquam hac earne libentius edit.
Nam scelere in tanto ne quaeras et dubites an

Prima voluptatem gula senserit; ultimus autem

Qui stetit absumpto jam toto corpore, ductis
Per terram digitis, aliquid de sanguine gustat.
Vascones haec fama est, alimentis talibus olim
Produxere animas3 sed res diversa, sed illic

Fortunae invidia est bellorumque ultima, casus

Extremi, longae dira obsidionis egestas,

unknown nor unpractised at Rome when
Juvenal wrote: if his friend was attached
to them a complilnent might be intended,
though even in that case the introduction
of Prometheus would show a want of judg-
ment. I can think of nothing to the pur·
pose.’' Gifl‘ord does not commonly fall into
this sort of pedautry. The myster-ies of
Mithra were probably as little known to
or eared for by Juvenal and his imaginary
friend as the doctrines of Christianity,
which his translator supposes him to have
been influenced by.

87. Sed qui mordere cadaver] ‘ Sed' is,
as before, a way of carrying on the subject
after a digression. As to ‘ sustinuit ’ see
S. xiv. 127, n. ‘ Whoever had the beart to
taste the carcase never ate any meat with
greater relish.' ‘Qui' implies that every
oue who tasted was pleased, as ‘nam ’
shows; “for you are not in a crime so
great to hesitate and ask whether it was
only the first palate that was sensible of
pleasure. Nay, the very last man, who
stopped behind after the whole body was
eaten up, scraped the bloody earth with
his fingere aud licked them.'’ It is a
horrid story.

93. Vascones, haecsama θεὴ] The ter-
affimggnsszfvfficvffiztgssffig ξὶἰῗᾶέἰ
of Sertorius, ιο. 72, many of the towns in
Hispania which had taken part with him
against Cn. Pompeius and Q. Metellus
Pius (the son of the more distinguished
Metellus Numidicus) held out aud were
besieged by those commanders or their le-
gati. Among the rest was Calagurris Nas-
ffi:.t⁰l'st⁰..⁰1¹‚²..fi¹5‚} &422213'3302355533
besieged during the life of Sertorius it was

attacked again after his death by L. Afra-
nius, the legatus of Pompeius. Although
Sertorius had acted with great severity to
some of the native nobility shortly before
his death, the people were devoted to him,
as Plutarch says, and the inhabitants of this
city resiste-d the siege to such extremities
that they were reduced to eating each
other. The account of Valerius Maximus
is that they only ate the women and chil-
dren. “ Quo perseverantius interempti
Sertorii cineribus obsidionem Cn. Pom-
peii frustrantes fidem praestarent, quia
nullum jam aliud iu urbe eorum supererat
animal, uxores suas natosque ad usum
nefariae dapis verterunt. Quoque diutius
armata juventus viscera sua visceribus suis
aleret, infelices cadaverum reliquias salire
non dubitavit '' (vii. 6. Ext.). This obsti-
nate resistance seems to have made a
great impression on the Romans. Florus
(iii. 22) says “in fame nihil non experta
Calagurris.’'

94. sed res diversa, sed illic] ‘Sed ' is
repeated here as ‘at' is in Horace, S. i.
3. 32, sq.‚

At est bonus ut meliorvir

Non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus, at in-
genium ingens

Inculto latet hoc sub corpore,’'

 

and in other places mentioned in a note
there. Juvenal says in the case of the
Vascones the circumstances were different ς
it was the mallee of Fortune and the ex-
treinities of war that drove them to this
horrid act. ‘ Bellorum ultima ' is like ‘¹ dis-
criminis ultima '’ (xii. 55). The Greeks
commonly used ἔσχατα iu the same way.
