30. Ipse capillato dg'ffusum] The great
inan himself drinks wine made centuries
before, when men wore beards. As the
Romans are said to have left off beards 300
years before Christ (see Hor. C. ii. 15.
11, n.)‚ there is exaggeration here. ‘ Dif-
fusuin' is the word for transferring from the
‘dolium‚' the large vessel in which the wine
fermented, to the ‘ ainphora,' in which it
was kept (Hor. S. ii. 2. 58, n.‚ and Epp. i.
5. 2: ‘⁴ Vina bibes iterum Tauro diffusa ”).
The practice of marking on the amphora
the name of the consuls in whose year it
was filled is referred to on Horace, C. iii.
8. 12. Horace speaks of the wine of the
Social &Var period, scel—89: “Et cadum
Marsi memorem duelli ’³ (C. iii. 14. 18).

32. C'ardiaeo nunqu-am cyathum] The
‘cardiacus morbus' was an affection of the
steinach attended with profuse perspira-
tion‚ for which, according to Pliny (H. N.
xxiii. 1), wine was considered essential;
some administering it in the early stage of
the disease, and others when the patient
was recovering. Seneca says, “bibere et
sudare vita cardiaci est ’³ (Epp. 15). This
man would not send his friend a ⁶ cyathus ’
(which was the twelfth part of a ‘sexta-
rius,’ and a ‘ sextarius' was equal to a pint)
of his old wine to save his life. As to the
Alban, Setine, and other Italian wines‚ see
Hor. C. i.9. 7, n.; iv. 11. 2, n.; S. ii. 8.16, n.

36. Thrasea Helvidiusque] P. Thrasea
Paetus was father-in-law to Helvidius Pris-
cus, and both were celebrated for their
independence in the senate during the
reign of Nero, by whom Thrasea was put
to death. Helvidius was killed by order
of Vespasian five years after his father-in-
law. They appear from this passage to
have been in the habit of keeping the
birthdays of the two Bruti (M. and D.) and
Cassius, to show their hatred of tyrant-s;
and the anet-dotes told of them by Tacitus

and other writers are all to the same effect.
They are here represented as drinking to
their heroes’ memory in the choicest wine,
with crowns of flowers on their heads,
which was from the earliest times the com-
mon practice at dinner, especially on im·
portant occasions.

38. Heliadum crustas] Ovid (Met. ii.
325, sqq.) relates how the three daughters
of the Sun, Phaethusa, Lampetie, and
Phoebe, wept for their brother Phaeton on
the banks of the Eridanus, and were turned
into poplars from which tears came forth,
and were hardened by the sun into amber,
‘ succinum' or ‘electrum.’ Pliny discusses
this fable, and gives his opinion upon the
nature of amber (H. N. xxxvii. 2, 3).
The meaning of ‘crustae' has been variously
stated. The distinction given in Smith’s
Dict. Ant. (Art. Chrysendeta‚ p. 227) be-
tween ‘ crustae ' and ‘emblemata,’ that
“ the former were probably embossed figures
or chasings fixed on to the silver, and the
latter inlaid or wrought into it,'' is not.
correct, for Cicero says that Verres took
off the ‘ crustae' or ‘ emblemata ' from the
vessels he stole at Catina : “iis crustae aut
emblemata detrahebantur.” They must
both therefore have beeu moveable. (In
Verr. ii. 4. 23, Long's note.) If they had
not the same meaning, aud fiom these
words of Cicero it would seem they had not,
‘crustae’ were probably plates of thin metal,
as the name implies (see Forcell.)‚ and
‘emblemata’ figures laid on to the vessel.

inaequales beryllo] Of the beryl, which
is a species of emerald, Pliny says, “poli-
untur omnes sexangula figura artificum
ingeniis—aliter enim politi non habent
fulgorem enndem’' (xxxvii. 5) ; which ex-
plains why Juvenal calls the cups inlaid
with these stones ‘inaequales' ‘Phiala'
was the Greek name corresponding to the
Latin ‘ patera,’ a broad flat cup for drink-
