catastrophe that happened to Mardonius,
whose fleet was wrecked there in the first
expedition of Darius against Greece,
Xerxes ordered the low isthmus of the
peninsula (Acte) to be cut through, and a
annal was made capable of floating two
triremes abi-east. Juvenal treats the
matter as an invention ; but the canal has
been recently traced. See article ‘ Athos'
in the Penny Cyclopaedia. Herodotus
(vii. 22) says it was about twelve stadia
long, and by measurement it appears to be
2500 yards, which at the rate of 625 feet
to the stadium, is exactly twelve stadia.

175. constratum classibus isdem] This
refers to the bridge of boats across the
Hellespont. Lucretius thus refers to the
same (iii. 1029, sqq.) :

“Ille quoque. ipse viam qui quondam per
mare magnum
Stravit, iterque dedit legionibus ire per
Acalgietiililius salsas docuit superare lacunas.
Et contempsit equis insultans murmura
Lug-33:2³ adempto animam moribundo cor·
pore fudit.”

Herodotus speaks of several rivers (the
Scamander ιιι Asia, and others· ιιι Thrace,
Thessaly, and Achaia) being dried up by
the enormous host of Xerxes drinking of
them. This is easily explained. These
rivers are not perennia] Pstreams full of
water. The army could only find water
holes in many of them, and these they may
have exhausted. κοῖον δὲ πινόμενον οὐκ
ἐπέλιπε πλὴν τῶν μεγάλων ποταμῶν
(Herod. vii. 21). The Scholiast says Sos-

tratus was a poet who wrote of the ex-

ploits of Xerxes. This might be guessed
from the context. Whether the Scholiast
had better authority is doubtful. ‘Madi-

dis alis ’ is supposed to mean that he got
heated with the exertion of reciting his
poetry. This is not a satisfactory expla-

nation, and if Heinrich be right ιιι think-

ing these words to be a parody of Ovid
(Met. i. 264), “madidis Notus evolat alis,”
they may mean that his ssight was not a

reading of P. though the word in the MS.
has been corrected by a second hand into
‘ constratum.’]

180. In Corum alque Eurum] Corus
(or Caurus) is the N.W. wind, as Eurus is
the S.E. He flogged whatever wind op-
posed him. This may be a playful inven-
tion of J uvenal's, making Xerxes a hai-der
master to the winds than Aeolus himself,
and he was stern enough according to
Virgil. Xerxes' castigation and chaining
of the Hellespont for breaking down his
bridge are told by Aeschylus (Persae v.
745, sqq.) and Herodotus (vii. 35). The
truth of the story is not admitted by the
latest editors of those authors, Paley and
Blakesley, and others before them. Grote

mercifully not to brand the god as well as
flog him. Any god would be glad to be
slave to such a master? '¹ Ruuaway or
thievish slaves had a mark put upon their
foreheads. But Herodotus says he had
heard a report that the madman had sent
persons to inflict this further degradation
on the sea, and to tell its waves that their
master laid this just punishment upon
them (l. c. ). 1⁴or this reason the commen-
tators have meddled with a very good text
