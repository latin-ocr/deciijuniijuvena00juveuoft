130. qui tu impunitior exis] This is like
what Davus says to his master in the

same sort of connexion in Horace, S. ii. 7.

“Teiigo plector enim. Qui tu impunitior
1 a

Quae parvo sumi nequeunt obsonia cap-
tas ?

‘ Exis ’ is used much as above, 78. ‘ How
do you come off less scathed than the
slave that gets a flogging ?' As to ‘ seu-
tica' see note on Hor. S. i. 3. 119, “Ne
scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello.'’
It was a light whip wit-h one thoug (‘ ha-
bena,’ see last note).

132. Mane piyer stertis] Here we
have a man who is distracted between the
elaims of two masters, Indulgence and
Avarice. Avariee has a hard struggle to
get him out of bed. ‘Et quid agam ?’
‘besides if Ι do get up, what is there to
do θ’ a very common question with idle
people. Avariee tells him to go and get a
cargo from the Euxine and Aegean. ‘ Sa-
perdae’ were small fish caught in the
Euxine and salted for exportation. [Jahn
has ‘⁸ ‘ Rogitas ?’ En saperdam.''] Beavers
were in former times abundant on the
north shores of the Euxine. See Strabo,
iii. p. 163, and Virg. Georg. i. 58, “viro-
saque Pontus Castorea.'’ Flax, from the
eonrser fibres of which tow was made, was
imported from Egypt in large quantities.
Indian peppers (55) and Arabian frankin-
cense would be shipped

at the ports of
Syria and Egypt.

Virgil says, “ Sola
India nigrum Fert ebenum, solis est turea
virga Sabaeis '' (Georg. ii. 117), on which
Heyne says virgil by India may mean
Abyssinia where ebony grows. It could not
have been brought overland from the Eust
lndies. bnt may have come by the Red
Sea through Egypt. As to the Coan
dresses see notes on Juv. ii. 66; vi. 259;
viii. 101. It is supposed silk was the
chief part of the material used, though the

texture was open and transparent. Gib-
bou has remarks on the use and manu-
facture of silk by tho ancients, which will
entertain the render (caps. XL„ L111.). He
attributes these mauufactures to Ceos.
‘Lubrica' is ‘smooth.’ I think it not
unlikely again that Persius may uncon-
sciously have had in mind Horace’s ‘ Lu-
brica eonehylia' (S. ii. 4. 30), and trans-
ferred to the silk the epithet of the fish
from which it was dyed, as Juvenal speaks
of ‘conchylia Coa’ (viii. 101), for Coan
dresses dyed with purple. Jahn thinks
Coa here may mean Coan wines (Hor. S. ii.
4. 29), aud ‘lubrica' that they are easily
swallowed.

136. e sitiente camelo.] The ancients
knew that a camel could go long without
think, but they did not know the provision
of nature by which it is enabled to do so.
Pliny (H. N. viii. 18) says it can go with-
out water for four (lays, but it is certain
it ean go many inore. Avarice bids the
man hasten and be the first to buy the
pepper directly it was taken off the back
of the beast. She bids hini turn a bai·-
gain, tell lies and swear to them. And
when he answers, ‘Jove will hear him,'
she calls him a dolt, and says he must
starve if he intends to live with the fear of
Jove before his eyes. ‘Verte aliquid’ is
properly ‘make an exehange ;' “negotiare
et speciem pro specie muta” (Schol.):
here a eheating bargain is implicd. ‘Eheu !'
is contemptuous; ‘whew!’ our eomic
writers would say, trying to write a
wliistle. ‘ Varo: the Scholiast says, is a
soldier's servant z “ varones dicuntur servi
militum, qui utique stultissimi sunt, servi
scilicet servorum.'' ‘Calo' was the Ro-
man name for such (see above, 95, n.).
‘ varo: or ‘baro,’ as it is otherwise writ-
ten, is said to have been a Gauiis-h word.
( See Forcellini.) The confusion of B and
V hus been notieed before. (Juv. xvi.
56, n.) Rutgersius, Lcet. Venusinae,
c. 23, says all that need be said on the
