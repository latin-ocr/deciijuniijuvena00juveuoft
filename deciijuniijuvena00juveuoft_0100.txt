D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quem libet occidunt populariter ι inde reversi
Conducunt foricas: ct cur non omnia? quum sint
Quales ex humili magna ad fastigia rerum

Extollit quoties voluit Fortuna jocari.

Nec volo nec possum3 ranarum viscera nunquam

Quae mandat, norint alii : me nemo ministro

Fur erit, atque ideo nulli comes exeo, tanquam
hlaucus et exstinctae corpus non utile dextrae.
Quis nunc diligitur nisi conscius et cui fervens

Aestuat occultis animus semperque tacendis?

Nil tibi se debere putat, nil conferet unquam,

37. inde reversi Condueunt forieas:]
They give them shows, and then go back
to their trade, which condescends to low
gains. They are not above farming the
public ‘foricae‚' places of convenience in
Rome for passengers‚ which were ereeted at
the public expense and farmed. They were
no doubt like the cabinets d'aisance at
Paris, where they are private property.
‘And what,' says Umbricius, ‘is to prevent
their having a monopoly of all these things,
since they are of the number of those whom
Fortune, when in a merry mood, raises from
low degree to the highest? ’ The persons
who contracted for these last mentioned
places were called ‘foricarii.' See Casaubon
on Sueton. Vesp. c. 23: “Quod etiam
urinae vectigal commentus esset.’' He
quotes Lucretius, iv. 1026, sqq.

42. laudare et poscere;] ‘Poscere' is
generally supposed to mean ‘to ask for a
copy,’ as Gifford says. It may be to call
for the book, i.e. to ask to hear it.

‘motus „istrorum iyn0r05] ‘I cannot
make gain by astrology‚ of which Ι know
nothing.’ See below, vi. 553, sqq.‚ xiv.
248, and Hor. C. i. 11, Introd. A favourite
subject for consulting these fortune-tellers
upon was the probable time when a relation
would die and leave his money behind,
as appears from this place and the
above: “neque ulla de re saepius eon-

sulfgrpitur astrologi.’' (Casaubon on Pers.
ιι. .

44. ranarum viscera] He means the
‘rubeta‚³ from which poison was extracted.
(See i. 70, n.) He could not profess to be
an haruspex, to aseertain such matters
from the entrails of animals. See below,
vi. 548, sqq„ where it is said the astro-
loger had more credit than the haruspex.

46. noo-int] The MSS. read ‘norunt.'
Several old editions and Heinrich have
‘ norint,' which is the better reading.

47. nulli eomes exem] ‘ For this reason
I never go abroad in company, Ι have no
companion, because all have some thieving
to do, and they look upon me as one
maimed, with a hand fit for nothing, a mere
lump of dead flesh.' This is the meaning
of ‘exstinctae eorpus non utile dextrae?
where ‘dextrae' is the genitive of quali-
ty. ‘ Comes ³ means ‘comes exterior? the
great man's walking companion (v. 131,
n.).

49. nisi conscius] ‘ Conscius' is an ae- “

complice, as “ miseram se conseia clamet ”
(Hor. S. i. 2. 130), and “quo te demisit
peccati conscia herilis '' (S. ii. 7. 60). The
next is a good expressive line, the heart
boiliug with secrets it is afraid to betray,
being a party to the crimes through taking
reward to hide them. Martial (vi. 50)
says of one Thelesinus, as long as he kept
good company he could not buy himself
decent clothes, but when he took to that of
lewd men he could affort] to buy all manner
of fine things. Therefore says he: “Vis
