SATI ΗΑ V. 1-1 :3

SATIRA V.

INTRODUCTION.

L. ANNAEUS CORNUTUS, to whom this satire is addressed, as stated in the Introduction,
was the instructor of Persius, who went to him ns soon as he carne to mun's estate, to
leam the Stoic philosophy. He was a native of one of the two places in Libyn named
Leptis (Κορνοῦτος Aemi-rm- φιλόσοφος· ἡ δὲ Λέπτις πόλις Λιβύης. suidas, Κορνοῦτος).
His name shows him to have been a freedmun of one of the Annaei, of which family
there were many wealthy branchos. Seneca was onc of them, and was a friend of
Cornutus. The poet Lucan was an Annaeus, and one of his pupils. Dion Cassius
(62, c. 29) says that Nero, intending to write a Roman history in Epic verse, consulted
Cornutus as to the number of books it should be in. Some of his ilattcrers told him they
should be four hundred, but Cornutus said no one would read them. And when some
one said Chrysippus, the Stoic‚ had written many more, Cornutus answered that his
books had something useful in them for human life. Whereupon Nero sent him into
exile. This must have been after the death of Persius, Λα). 62. According to J erome
it was in 68, 1118 last year of Nero’s reign, [but according to Dion it was before the
consulship of Telesinus, and therefore before B.c. 66.]

The Satire turns upon the character and teaching of Cornutus. It is supposed to be
delivered in conversation with him, and the introduction is well arranged. Persius
begins by referring to the commonplace of poets asking the Muse for a hundred tongues ;
and Cornutus asks what he can be about, and hopes he is not going to write a tragedy
or an Epic poem. He answers that he wants this gift of tongues to tell his affection
and gratitude towards his friend and teacher, whom he addresses in affectionate lan-
guage, declaring that their sates are the same, and their lives under the protection of
the same star. He conti-asts the earnest life of his master, devoted to study and to
the instruction of the young, with the various selfish pursuits of the world ,· and he
takes that opportunity to urge upon old and young the study of philosophy. One of
the tenets of the Stoics is that which is dwelt upon at length in the seventh satire of
Horace's second book, and in the fifth of Cicero’s Paradoxa, of which the title is ὅτι
μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος. Taking up this doctrine Persius occupies
the rest of his Satire with illustrations of it, showing that real liberty is not that of
the slave set free by the Praetor, though with his freedom he may get the world to
worship him, and fancy he is at liberty to live as he pleases. These notions hc treats
ns old wives’ tales ; for the Praetor cannot teach a man the duties of life and how to
enjoy it, any more than he can teach a low fellow to play the harp. A man cannot do
what 118 pleases, for he can only do what he is fit for. 1f he is upright, and discerning,
and just, and moderate, and kind, and liberal without extravagance, and free from
avarice, he is a free man ; but if not, he is as much a slave as the man that carries his
master’s things to the bath, and is flogged if he loiters on the way. There are those,
118 goes on to say, who are slaves alternately of avarice and sels-indulgence, but who
believe themselves free notwithstanding. The youth who has summoned courage to
give np his mistress aster she has ill-treated him, and thinks he is going to lead a new
life, finds his liberty is not proof against the first invitation to return. The ambitious
man is the slave of the mob, the superstitious of his fears and of the knaves that impose
upon him.

The Satire ends abruptly with the old hit at the rude gentlemen of the army (S. iii.
77, sqq.)‚ whose business, of course, it is to ridicule these fine sentiment& This abrupt-
