Improbulum, superest illic qui ponere cogat.
“ Vis tu consuetis audax conviva canistris

Implcri panisque tui novisse colorem ‘.‘’'——-

.“ Scilicet hoc fuerat propter quod saepe relicta
Conjuge per montem adversum gelidasque cucurri
Esquilias, fremeret saeva quum grandine vernus
Juppiter ct multo stillaret paenula nimbo ! ”—

Aspice quam long-o distendat pectore lancem

Quae fertur domino squilla, et quibus undique septa
AsparagiS, qua despiciat convivia cauda

Quum venit excelsi manibus sublata ministri.

Sed tibi dimidio constrictus cammarus ovo

Ponitur, exigua feralis coena patella.

Ipse Venafrano piscem perfundit : at hic qui
Pallidus affertur miscro tibi caulis olebit

this sense Forcellini understands it here 3
and Heinrich says the other is mere non-
sense. All the MSS. have ‘ artocopi,’ which
means ‘a baker.' If that is not the true
reading, which it probably is not but a
gloss, it only shows the sense in which
‘artoptae’ was taken by the copyists. Ru-
perti has ‘artocopiss Jahn and Heinrich
‘artoptae’

¹73.Improbulum,] This diminutive is only
found bere. The poor man is no better
than a thief if he puts his hand into the
wrong bread-basket. ⁴ Superest illic,’ ‘ there
is one standing over you there' (as if the
man were pointed out).

74. Vis tu consuetis] This is the read-
ing of the best MSS. Others have ‘ vix‚'
which gives no sense. The words are sup-

to be those of the slave standing by
telling the rash guest to be satisfied with
his own sort of bread. On this use of ‘ vis
tu' Gronovius has a long note on Seneca (le
Ira. iii. c. 38, in which he shows by many
¹ examplae, of which this is one, that the
fonnula is one of bidding οι· exhortation,
and equivalent to ‘ nonne vis? ‘ will you
not fill your belly from your usual basket ?'
So the town mouse says to his friend, “ Vis
tu homines urbemque feris praeponere sil-
visiv’ (Horace, S. ii. 6. 92, where Bentley
gives the same meaning, and refers to Gro-
novius' note.)

¹7⁷. per montem adversum] ‘ Up the
hill: that is, the Esquiline. It was an ex-
posed part of the town, and therefore Pro-
pertius (iv. 8. 1) calls it ‘ aquosas‚' as Juve-
nal calls it ‘gelidas.’ Mr. Palcy (on the

verse of Propertius) gives ‘ aquosas ' a dif-
ferent meaning. But this is probably the
true one.

79. Jicppz‘ler] See Horace, C. i. 1. 25,
n. The ‘ paenula ' was a thick sort of
rug thrown over the ‘toga ’ in bad weather.

81. squilla] This is here a lobster. It
is generally used for a prawn or shrimp.
‘ Asparagus ' is commonly used in the

lural.

p 81. constriclus cammarus] ‘Cammarus’
(κάμμαρος) was a crayfish or a crab of some
sort. ⁴ Constrictus’ Grangaeus understands
of the sauce served with the fish thickened
with half the yolk of au egg. So Heinrich
takes it. Ι think it only describes the
pinched miserable appearance of the crab,
and that half a hard egg was servcd with
it. “Thou some slirunk crabfish and half
egg dost get'’ (Holyday). ‘ Feralis coena,'
‘a funeral suppcr‚' refers to the ‘silicer-
nium,’ a dinner usually given after a fune-
ral, and attended by the friends of the dead
person. The fare was not very tempting.
See Lipsius on Tac. Ann. vi. 5: “Noven—
dialem coenam dioee'sse : Coena dicta feralis
et silicernium. Ei vero certi quidam cibi
proprii, ova ad lustrationem adhibere solita,
lens, sal, libum.''

86. Ipse lbnasrano] ‘Ipse' is the master
throughout. Venafrum (Venafro) was par-
ticularly celebrated sor its olives in Horace's
days: “ Viridique certat bacca Venafro ”
(C. ii. 6. 15) ; ‘⁴ Pressa Venafranae quod
bacca remisit olivae'' (S. ii. 4. 69). The
town was in Campania near the borders of
Campania and Samnium.
