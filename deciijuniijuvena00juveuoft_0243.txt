tian town) which was celebrated. ‘ Quan-
tumvis’ is ‘ever so much,' as we say.

16. attritam Catinensi pumice] The tomi
of Catina (Catania) was situated at the
foot of Aetna, and the rough stones thrown
up by that volcano were abundant in
the neighbourhood. They were used sor
rubbing the skin by the effeminate (see
ix. 95 .

17.)Squalentes traducit (ιω-9,] ‘Squa-
lentes’ means ‘rough,' ‘1·ugged‚’ and is
opposed to the flue soit skin this degenerate
Fabius cultivate& ‘Traducit’ seems to
be ⁸ exposes to contempt? Forcclliui gives
examploe of this meaning. The next line
is, ‘If he buy poison and disgrace his
house by having his bust broken, as if he
were convicted of murder it would be,
either by the public executioner or by the
populace.' ‘ Funestare ' is properly to
defile by blood (see Forcellini).

19. exornent undique cerae Αἰγίῳ] See
vv. 1 and 8, n.

21. Paullus vel Cossus vel Drusus] These
were cognomens of the Aemilia, Cornelia,
and Claudia gentes. There were more
than one whom Juvenal may have had in
mind. The Cossus he thought of appears
from v. 26 to have been Cossus Cornelius
Lentulus Gaetulicus, who got that name
for defeating the Gaetuli, who had invaded
the dominicus of Juba (ΔΑ). 6). ‘ Hos'

class is true nobility, he is here speaking
of virtue in the privileged class, as it is
called. ¹ First let me see your virtues‚’ he
says to them, ‘and then I shall see your
nobility ς otherwise 1 shall allow you no
nobility at all!

27. Summa] A ‘stemma' of the Junii
Silani will be found in Sinith's Dict. Biog.
Some of the later members of the family
were related by marriage to the Caesars.

29. populus quod clamat] Pliny (H. N.
viii. 46) describes the custom here referred
to: ‘⁴ Bos in Aegypto etiam numinis vice coli-
tur, Apim vocant—Non est fas eum certos
vitae excedere annos, mersumque in sacer-
dotum fonte enecant, quaesituri luctu alium
quem substituant 3 et donec invenerint
moerent, derasis etiam capitibus 5 nec
tamen unquam diu quaeritur. Inventus
deducitur Memphim a sacerdotibus.'' The
exclamation raised when the bull was found
was (in Greek) εὑρήκαμεν, συγχαίρωμεν. The
Egyptians were rejoicing on such an occa-
sion when Cambyses invaded the country
(Herod. iii. 27). Osiris was worshipped
under the form of Apis at Memphis and
of Mnevis at Heliopolis; both were bulls.
On the subject of Bull lVorship in Egypt
and the East see Long’s Egyptian Anti·
quities, v. ii. 288, sqq.

30. generosum dixerit] ‘Generosus,’ as
its derivation shows, belongs properly to
dcscent. But, like εὐγενής, it came to
have a wider sense (vv. 57. 224). A man
might be ‘nobilis’ without being ‘gene-
rosus,’ the former being nobility of pcrsonal
distinction, the latter of patric-ian blood.
