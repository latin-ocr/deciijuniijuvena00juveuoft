LIFE OF PERSIUS. xxv

He reverenced as a father Servilius Nonianus. Through Cornutus he
made the acquaintance of Anuacus Lucanus likcwise⁶, who was of his
own age and a disciple of Cornutus. Now Cornutus was a tragic writer
of that day', of the Stoic sect, and he left behind him books os philo-
sophy. Lucanus so admired the writings of Flaccus, that while hc was
reciting he could scarcely refrain srom crying out [and saying that this
was true poetry]⁸. He became acquaiutcd with Seneca als0,1atein
life, but not so as to be taken by his character. Hc enjoycd in Cornu-
tus’ house the society of two most learned men of very holy lives, at
that time earnestly engaged in philosophy, namely‚ Claudius Agathe-
merus, a physician of Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates of
Magnesia, whom above all others he admired and emulated, for they
were his contemporaries and disciplcs of Cornutus ⁹. He was also for
nearly ten years greatly beloved by Paetus Thrasea, and travelled
with him sometimes, Thrasea having married Persius' kinswoman Arria.
He was a man of most gentle manners, of maidenly modesty, of hand-
some form, and a patteru of piety towards his mother, and sister, and
aunt. He was discreet and chastc. Hc left about two million
sesterces to his mother and sister, and only wrote a note to his mother,
asking her to give Cornutus a hundred thousand sesterces, as some say,
but as others will have it, twenty pounds’ weight of wrought sili-er, and
about seven hundred volumes of Chrysippus, 01· all his libra1y¹. But
Cornutus took the books and left the money for his mother and sister,
whom he had made his heirs ². He wrote seldom and slowly. This
very book he left unfinished. Some verses have been taken from the
end of the book, that it might seem finished. Cornutus made some
trifling corrections; and when Caesius Bassus asked that he might him-
self be allowed to edit it, he gave it him for that purpose. Flaccus also
in his boyhood had written a comedy called Restio ³, and one book of

⁶ By ‘Annaeum etiam Lucanum’ he means Lucanus who was also one of the Annaei,
as Cornutus himself was.

⁷ ‘ ngicus,’ the reading of all the MSS„ is most probably corrupt.

⁸ “ Quin illa esse vera poemata diceret.” These words are no doubt an interpolation.
Heinrich thinks the interpolator had in mind the modest language of Persius in the
Prologus.

⁹ ‘Cornuti minores? ΤΙιο common reading is ‘ Cornuto.’ Agathemerus' name is
given as Agaternus in the MSS. See below.

¹ This should be ‘or as some say.' but the text is defective. (Heinrich.) As to the
books of Chrysippus, see Introduction to S. v.

² The MSS. have “ pecuniam sororibus quas frater heredes fecerat reliquit‚’‘ which
contradicts what has just been said. ‘ Frater' was added when the first mistake, ‘sorori-
bus: was made.

³ The MSS. have Vescio. Heinrich changes this to Restio, the Ropcmaker, which

was the title of one of Laberius’ farces.
