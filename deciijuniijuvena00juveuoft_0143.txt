SI te propositi nondum pudet atque eadem est 1110115,
Ut bona summa putes aliena vivere quadra,-

Si potes illa pati, qnae nec Sarmentus iniquas

Quamvis jurato metuam tibi credere testi.

Ventre nihil novi frug-alius.

1. propositi] He speaks as if this was the
0110 purpose of his life.

2. aliena vivere quadra ‚·] Forcellini says
‘ quadra ’ means here a table, quoting Varro
(de Ling. Lat. iv. 25) : “Mensam escariam
cibillam appellabant : ea erat quadrata ut
etiam 1111110 in castris est.” In virgil (Aen.
vii. 114) there is

“Et violare manu malisque audacibus or-
bem

Fatalis crusti patulis 1100 parcere quadris.’'

On which Servius says, “ aut mensis ς et est
antonomasia, nam supra orbem dixit: aut
quadris sraymentis accipimus, ut J uvenalis
Ut bona summa putes,” &a Heinrich calls
it πίναξ, a dish. The Romans had leaves
of bread marked off into quarters like our
hot cross buns, each part of which was called
‘ quadra) Scaliger takes ‘ quadra' here for
bread ; and Grangaeus follows him, ex-
plaining the words by ‘impensis alienis!
The expression seems to be proverbial.
Erasmus has among his proverbS‚ “ vivere
quadra propria.'’ Horace says, ‘⁴ Et mihi
dividuo findetur munere quadra '³ (Epp. i.
17. 49), where a. fourth part is not meant,
but a bit of the man’s property. Martial has
“sectae quadra placentae '' (iii. 77 3 vi. 75).
This may be the origin of the expression 3
and ‘ aliena vivere quadra,’ may be to live
on the erumbs from another inan's table.
Servius so understood it.

3. quae nec Sarmentus iniquas] ‘Ini-
quas mensas‚’ ‘unequal tames: are those to
which little men are invited by their betters,
taking their chance of the fare they will
get. 'she parasite Sarmentus mentioned by
Horace 111 the account of his journey to
Brundisium (S. i. 5) has been confounded by
the Scholiast and others with this man 3
who, Plutarch says in his life of M. Anto-
nius (c. 59), was a young favourite of Au-

gustus at the time of the battle of Actium.
'l‘his does not agree with the account given
of Horacc’s man in a note 011 the above
place. Galba is called Aulus by Quintilian
who mentions several of his good sayings
(lust. vi. 3). Plutarch (Erot. 0. 16) tells of
him an anecdote which is referred to 011
Hor. S. i. 2. 46, how he entertained Maece-
nas, and pretended to be 1151001) while he
took liberties with his wife. The same sort

·’ of story has been told of others, and the

proverb, “non omnibus dormio‚” arose out
of some such 0850 (Cic. ad Fam. vii. 24).
Galba appears to have been proverbial for
his humour as well as his servility, and
Martial refers to him twice (i. 42. x. 101).
'she Scholiast says “ Apicius Galba sub Ti-
berio Scurra nobilis fuitss' Gabba is the
reading of three good MSS„ but it is only
a Greek corrupted form, as Heinrich shows.
Jahn has it in his text [and Ribbeck]
Heinrich and Schopen take ‘Apicius ’ to be
a mistake of the copyist, for Aulus, the
name Quintilian gives him.

5. Quamvis jurato] This is a proverbial
way of speaking common and obvious.
The commentators quote Cicero ad Att.
xiii. 28, “jurato mihi crede ;'' and Plautus
(Amphitr. i. 1. 281), “Nam injurato scio
plus credet mihi quam jurato tibi.'' 111118-
tus in these cases ‘on oath,’ ‘sworn' is
used, as in Horace (Epp. i. 17. 60), “per
sanctum juratus dicat Osirim?

6. Vendre nihil novisruyaliua] He says
the belly is very frugal, it can do with very
little; but even if enough be not forth-
coming to fill an empty belly, 110 had better
beg than get his meals in that dirty way.
‘Crepido’ is a wall or a raised footpath
by the 101111 51110, 01, as Heinrich supposes,
the steps of a house or public building,
where poor pcople lay und often passed the
night, as [loy do now in Rome aud Naplcs.
