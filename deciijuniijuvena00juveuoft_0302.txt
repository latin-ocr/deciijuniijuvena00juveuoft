2 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Optandas ι sed multae urbes et publica vota

Vicerunt.

Igitur Fortuna ipsius et Urbis
Servatum victo caput abstulit.

Lentulus, hac poena caruit, ceciditque Cethegus
Integer, ct jacuit Catilina cadavere toto.
Formam optat modico pueris, majore puellis

Murmure, quum Veneris fanum videt anxia mater,

Usque ad delicias votorum.

“ Corripias ⁴? Pulchra gaudet Latona Diana.'’
Sed vetat optari faciem Lucretia qualem
Ipsa habuit: cuperet Rutilae Virginia gibbum

Accipere atque suam Rutilae dare.

Hoc cruciatu

“ Cur tamen,” inquit,
Filius autem 295

Corporis egregii miseros trepidosque parentes

Semper habet.
Atque pudicitiae.

Rara est adeo concordia formae
Sanctos licet horrida mores

Tradiderit domus ac veteres imitata Sabinos,

286. Hoc cruciatu Lentulum] P. Cor-
nelius Lentulus Sura and C. Cornelius
Cethegus were left behind by Catilina
when he left Rome, to carry ont the con·
spiracy, to fire the city, and kill the sena-
tors. They were betrayed and taken, and
pursuant to a vote of the Senate they
were strangled in prison by the common
executioner on the night of the 5th of
December, B.c. 63. “In carcere parri-
cidae strangulantur '’ (Florus iv. 1). Cati-
lina was pursued, and being unable to
escape, he engaged with a small undis-
ciplined army the regular troops, and was
killed, B.c. 62. Dion Cass. (xxxvii. 40)
says his head was sent to Rome that peo-
ple might believe he was (lead. If this be
true, Juvenal perhaps only thought of his
death on the field of battle. which was as
gallant as possible. “ Catilina longe a suis
inter hostium cadavera repertus est3 pul-
cherrima morte si pro patria sic concidisset”
(Florus iv. 1, fin. ς and Sallust, Cat. c. 61).
Mutilation was dreaded by the ancients.
Suetonius says of Nero, “Nihil prius ac
magis a comitibus exegerat quam ne potes-
tas cuiquam capitis sui fieret, sed ut quoquo
modo totus cremaretur '³ (c. 49).

290. Murmure, quum Veneris sanum]
The mother prays that her children may
be beautiful: the prayer is suppressed
with a murmur, “Illa sibi introrsum et
sub lingua immurmurat '³ (Pers. ii. 9), but
when she comes to pray for the girls her
eagerness almost breaks out into audible
words. There were teniples or chapels of

Venus in various parts of the city. ‘Usque
ad delicias votorum ’ Heinrich explains as
‘ usque ad ineptias,' to a foolish fondness,
quoting Seneca (de Beneficiis iv. 5) ι
“ neque enim necessitatibus tantummodo
nostris provisum est ι usque in delicias
amamur ;’' but as that applies to the love
of God for men, ‘ delicias ' is not ‘ineptias ¹
there. The translators and commentators
all differ more or less. It seems to mean
even to fastidiousness in her prayers. She
will not be content with any thing short of
perfection.

292. Pulchra qaudet Latona Diana]
This alludes probably to that passage in
which Virgil likens Dido to Diana (Aen. i.

“nglis hin Eurotae ripis aut per juga
Exei'cneit lDiana choros, quarn mille se·
ngctagtque hinc glomerantur Oreades3

illa pharetram
Fert humero, gradiensque deas super-
emmet omnes :

Ιιεῖίςοηὲθ tacitum pertemptant gaudia pec-
us.

294. Rutilae T‘z'ryinia gibbum] Rutila
is any one with a hump on her back. The
examples of Lucretia and Virginia are
both happily chosen. Purer examples of
womanhood are not upon record. Their
only fault was beauty. After ‘suam’
‘formam ³ is easily supplied.
