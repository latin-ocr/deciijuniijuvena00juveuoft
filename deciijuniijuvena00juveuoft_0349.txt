SATIRA XIII.

Si reddat veterem eum tota aerugine follem,
Prodigiosa tides et Tuscis digua libellis,
Quaeque coronata lustrari debeat agna.
Egregium sanctumque virum si cerno, bimembri

Hoc monstrum puero aut miranti sub aratro

05

Piscibus inventis et fetae comparo mulae,
Sollicitus tanquam lapides effuderit imber
Exameuque apium longa consederit uva

Culmine delubri, tauquam iu mare fluxerit amnis

Gurgitibus miris et laetis vertice torrens.

62. Tuscis dIyna libellis,] He says
such honesty is a prodigy worthy to be
recorded in the Etrurian books, that is the
books of the prophetS, “annosa volumina
vatum '' (Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 26, n., and
Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. i. 507, there referred
to). Cicero refers to the “libri Etruseo-
rum'' (de Div. ii. c. 23), and Pliny (H.
N. ii. 83) speaks of a tremendons prodigy
recorded “in Etruscae discipliuae volu-
.minibus‚’' two mountains falling into col-
lisiou, and then separatiug aud sending
out fire and smoke. These books were full
of mysterious prophecies, religious rites,
aud records of portentous events, and they
were found, Niebuhr says, in every town of
Etruria.

63. lustrari debeat ayma] A prodigy
which was supposed to forebode ill was met
by sacrifices, aud this act was expressed
technically by the word ‘ procurare.' The
illustratious that follow are among the
prodigies recorded by the Roman writers.
Livy speaks of a two-headed boy (xli. 26),
and Cicero (de Div. i. 53) of a two-headed
girl as prodigies auguring evil. But Cicero
denies that any event can be couuted a
prodigy: “nam si quod raro fit, id porten-
tum putandum est, sapientem esse por-
tentum est z saepius enim mulam peperisse
arbitror quam sapientem fuisse ’' (de Div.
ii. 28). This last was a proverb. Pliny
(Η. N. ix. 57) has a chapter on sea fish
found inland, which he makes out to be
rather common. Livy mentions such au
event (xlii. 2) and refers to stone showers
frequently3 and bees swarming on temples
and housae were equally ominous and still
more common. Pliny (H. N. ii. 56) speaks
of showers of blood and milk. Ruperti
gives many references to Livy and others
- for all these porteuts. As to the form
‘apium’ for ‘apum,' the variation of the
MSS. makes it doubtful whether it occurs

in the prose writers. Ovid (Met. xv. 383)
has “foetus Melliferarum apium sine
membris corpora nasci.'' The word ‘ uva ’
was used by the Romans for a clustcr of
bees as the Greeks used βότρυς, as Servius
says on Virg. Georg. iv. 559 : “ lentis uvam
demittere ramis.” Homer (Il. ii. 89) has
βοτρυδὸν δὲ πέτονται ἐπ’ ἄνθεσιν εἰαρινοῖσιν.

65. aut miranti sub aratro] The MSS.
vary a good deal licre. ‘ Aut' is the
reading of a few, and appears to me more
in J uvenal's style than another ‘ et,' which
appears in a larger number. ‘ Vel’ is in
some, which may have been invented for
the sake of the metrc ς it is not the right
word here. ‘Miranti' is the reading of
most and the best MSS„ except P„ from
which Jahn, Hermann [and Ribbeck]
have ‘mirandis' ‘ Miranti ’ is clearly bet-
ter. Heinrich quotes Virgil (Georg. ii..
82): “Exiit ad caelum ramis felicibus
arbos, Miraturque novas frondes et nou
sua poma.'’ 'l'he astonishment of the
plough is a natural idea 3 but it displeases
Heinecke, who approves of Gataker’s cor-
rection ‘lirauti.' [Gataker‚ Antoninus
viii. 15, p. 300, 2nd-ed„ when he proposes
‘liranti‚’ prudently adds, ‘si quid mutan-
dum fuerit.'] Some MSS. have helped-
the metre with ‘jan1.' M. has ‘et miranti
jam ;’ but the readcr has not now to be
remiuded of the frequent recurrence of
hiatus iu Juvenal.

70. lactis vertice torrens] The MSS.
vary as usual between ‘ vortice ’ and ‘ ver-
tice.’ The editors generally have the
latter form. The other is supported by
Porcellini. See note on Hor. C. ii. 9. 22:
“ Victis minores volvere vertices? [‘Gur-
gitibus miniis,’ Ribbeck, following Porsen
who seems to have founded this bad con·
jecture on the Scholiast's words ‘ aut lac-
teis aut sanguineis.']
