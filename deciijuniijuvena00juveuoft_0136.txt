8ss D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Temporibus diris tractanda putabat inermi 80

Justitia.

Venit et Crispi jucunda senectus,

Cujus erant mores qualis facundia, mite

Ingenium.

Maria ac terras populosque regenti

Quis comcs utilior, si clade et peste sub illa
Saevitiam damnare ct honestum afferre liceret 85

Consilium ⁴?

Sed quid violentius aure tyranni,

Cum quo de pluviis aut aestibus aut nimboso

Vere locuturi fatum pendebat amici?

Ille igitur nunquam direxit brae-hia contra

Torrentem, nec civis erat qui libera posset 90
Verba animi proferre et vitam impendere vero.

Sic multas hiemes atque octogesima vidit

Solstitia, his armis illa quoque tutus in aula.

Proximus ejusdem properabat Acilius aevi

Cum juvene indigno quem mors tam saeva maneret 95
Et Domini gladiis tam festinata : sed olim

Prodigio par est cum nobilitate senectus :

Unde fit, ut malim fraterculus esse Gigantis.

Profuit ergo nihil misero quod cominus ursos

repeating. Heinrich thinks ver. 78 is not
genuine; [and Ribbeck omits it. If this
verse is omitted. the full stop after ‘ Urbi'
must be changed to a comina3 and the whole
passage will thus be made clem-eiu]

80. inermi Justz'tia.] He says though
Pegasus was the best of his class, and a
good jurist, he was lax in the punishment
of offenders, which in such bad times was a
great fault. The ‘praefectus urbi' had ‘ju-
risdicti0‚' and there was no appeal from him
except to the emperor. ‘J ustitia ⁹ bears a
sword in all representations of her, and
sometimes a spear or a pair of scales.

Sl. Ciispijucunda seneetus,] ‘ Cheerful
old Crispus? Vibius Crispus was an orator
often mentioned by Quintilian, who speaks
of him in ternis like Juvenal, as “ vir in-
genii jucundi et elegantis'’ (v. 13. 48).
The Scholiast has a long note here which
refers to a different Crispus. Juvenal gives
him a pleasing character, but says he was
not stout enough to speak his mind and
swim against the stream, and lay down his
life as the price of truth.

94. Acilius] This is the father of Μ’.
Acilius Glabrio, who was consul with Tra-
jan ΑΒ. 91, and who was put. to death by
Domitian, Dion says, from jealousy of his
prowess in killing a lion in his amphithea-

tre on the Mons Albanus. See notes on
v. 60 and 99. The consul is the ‘juvenis'
mentioned in the next verse. As to ⁴ Do-
mini ' see above, v. 71, n.

96. sed olim] ‘Olim ' means here ‘for
some time past.' Forcellini gives other
examples from thelater writers. See S. vi. 346.

98. fraterculus esse Giyantis] [This
lineis omitted by Ribbeck] The Gigantes
were sons of Earth, γηγενεῖς. Persius has
“progenies terrae,'' ‘¹ terrae est jam filius''
(vi. 57, 59). When a man’s parents were
unknown he was referred to the common
mother 3 and as Casaubon says, those who
rose from obscurity to high place were
called ‘lumbrici‚' ‘ worms,' and by the
Greeks ἔντερα γῆς, ‘entrails of the earth!
(See below, viii. 45.) Cicero uses the phrase
‘terrae tilio nescio cui ' (ad At-t. i 13), and
the same in a letter to Trebatius (ad Fam.
vii. 9), “summo genere natus terrae filius‚”
as Quintilian says, speaking of cities,
“multum auctoritatis affert vetustas, ut
iis qui terra (licuntur orti.” (iii. 7, fin.)
Ruperti thinks Juvenal wrote ‘nolim‚' and
not ‘ malim,' meaning that he would rather
not be the humble friend of the great man
(Caesar). It was hard to go wrong, but
Ruperti is unfortunate.
