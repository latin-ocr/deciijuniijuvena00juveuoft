read the poetry aloud to himself, and to be
delighted as he hears it.

127. Non hic qui in crepidas] ‘ Not the
man who laughs at all that is Greek,' which
he expresses by ‘crepidas Graiorum? the
‘crepida' being the Greek shoe (κρῆπις),
from which the Romans called their trage-
dies with Greek plots ‘ crepidatae ' (see
note on Hor. A. P. 288). ‘Sordidus ’ is a
low fellow with no taste, a man who has no
more wit than to cry ‘lusce' after a man
with one eye, and thinks himself somebody
because he has been an aedile in a country
town. ‘ Possit ' means his power of satire
extends so far and no farther. The mood
is not the same as in ‘gestit‚' but neither
is the sense. Hc takes pleasure in the one,
and would be able to do the other. Casan-
bou substitutes ‘ poscit ³ for the sake of the
indicative. As to the country aediles, who
looked to the market and the weights and
measures, among other things, see notes on
Juv. iii. 179 3 x. 100. ‘ Hemina ³ was half a
‘ sextarius? ‘ Iniquus ' was the usual word
for a false measure, as in J uv. xiv. 126 :
“modio castigat iniquo.'' ‘Arretium'
(Arezzo) was a town of Etruria, between
the Tiber and the Arnus. There was an
old city of great antiquity, and a more
modern on the site of the present town,
where many curious relics have been found,
particularly of pottery, for which this town

· was famous. It is said to have been the

birth-place of Maecenas. ‘ Supinus ³ seems
to mean ‘ proud‚' with his head up, or as
one says, walking as if he had swallowed a
spit, quoting Epictetus (apud Arrianum i.
21), ὖβέλισκον καταπιὼν περιπατεῖς (Ρ111111).
Forcellini takes it so, and all the commen-
tators. Martia] (v. 8) has “ Haec et talia
dum refert supinus '² in the same sense.
131. Nee qm* abaco numeros] ‘Abaeus'
was a board or tray, with raised border and
wooden divisions, used for calculating num-
bers with pebbles. The way of doing it is
given conjecturally in Dict. Antiqq. The
author of the article ‘Abacus ’ in that dic-
tionary has mistaken this passage. It is

clear that the first sentence refers to arith·
metica] computations on an ‘abacus,' and
the second to geometrical figures drawn 011
saud, for which an ‘ abacus ’ was also used.
‘ Metas' are eones, but any diagrams may
be understood.
castic, like ‘possit dicere’ above.
has been proposed, for which Heinrich
quotes authority, but Ι prefer the common
reading: “ He knows how to laugh, the
elever fellow, at arithmetic and geometry,
and is ready at any time to be delighted if a
wauton prostitute pulls the beard of a phi-
losopher.'' ‘ Nonaria ' (meretrix) does not
occur elsewhere, and the only explanation
given of it is by the Scholiast, who says that
these women were so called because they

‘ Scit risisse vafer’ is sar·
‘ Sit '

might not begin their trade till the ninth
hour, the reason for which, he sayS, was
that young men might not leave their
military exercises 10 go to them. The
Scholiast 011 Juv. vi. 117 gives the same
explanation of the name. See Gesner,
Thes. L. L. ‘ Nonaria.’ Horace speaks of
the boys pulling the Stoic by his beard,
S. i. 3. 133.

134. His mane Edictuom] ‘ His’ is ‘to
such as these' (Juv. xv. 10, n.). To such
readers as these he leaves the life of the
idle and the profligate, the first of which
he expresses by the praetor's ‘edictum'
to represent the business of the forum
much frequented by idle people in the
morning, and the second by the name
of some woman, as it seems, of bad
character, or a name commonly borne by
such women. As to the ‘edicta’ of
Roman magistrates, see Long's Cic. vol.
1. p. 162. Jahn seems to incline to the
notion that the ‘edictum ' Persius means
is a play-bill of the gameS, with the names
of the gladiators and other matters. His
note is rather in the Ruperti style, ac-
knowledging the right but coquetting with
the wrong. ‘ Prandia ³ is not used strictly.
The ‘prandium ’ was eaten about noon.
He means ⁵ coena,' as in 67.
