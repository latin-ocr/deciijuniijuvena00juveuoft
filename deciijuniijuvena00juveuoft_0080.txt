30 D. JUNII JUVENAMS

Luctantur paucae, comedunt coliphia paucae :

Vos lanam trahitis calathisque peraeta refertis

Vellera: vos tenui praegnantem stamine susum 55
Penelope melius, levius torquetis Arachne,

Horrida quale facit residens in 0011100 pellex.

Notum est eur solo tabulas impleverit Hister

Liberto, dederit vivus eur multa puellae.

Dives erit magno quae dormit tertia lecto, 60
Tu nube atque tace : donant arcana cylindros.

53. Luetanlur paucae,] That some
women engaged 111 the combats of the arena
has been said before (i. 22, n.); and she
admits it, but says they are few, while
the men-women were many. ‘ Coliphia’ are
said to have been athletes' food, and this
passage confit-ms it. Salmasius (ad Tertull.
de Pallio, p. 220, quoted by Cramer on the
Scholiast here) derives the word from 1110
Greek κώληψ, κωλήπιον, which means the
knee or ankle joint; from which Forcellini
infers that the word means masses of dry
tough meat, chiefly pork or beef. One of
the Scholiasts says that Pythagoras taught
the athletes to train upon roast beef and
bread, they having been aecustomed 1ο eat
figs before, and that ‘coliphia’ means gene-
rally the food taken by athletes. Some, he
says, affirm that ‘ coliphia ' were made of
honey and leaven in an obscene form. An-
other Scholiast says that ‘coliphia ’ means
unleavened bread ; and on Plautus (Pers. i.
3. 12: ‘⁶ Collyrae facite ut madeant et eoli-
phia'³) Weise explains them as ‘panes re-
001111 caseo commixti? The derivation
above given seems very doubtful, but the
context leaves 110 doubt what the food was
used for sometimes.

54. Ῑόε lanam trahitis] ‘Trahere’ is
commonly used for spinning, as in Horace

(e. ii. 18. 7):

“Nec Laconicas mihi
Trahunt honestae purpuras elientae.”

“ You spin wool, and in baskets bear your
elewsss' is Stapylton's translation. T he
wool was spun into threads and put by in
baskets. ‘Stamen' is the thread with which
the spindle was ‘pregnant,’ when it was
twisted round it ready for weaving. Sopho-
{lels 1311311305 Oedipus say of his sons (Oed.
O - Ι 2

ὦ πάντ’ ἐκείνω τοῖς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ νόμοις
φύσιν κατεικασθέντε καὶ βίου τροφάς.
ἐκεῖ γὰρ οἱ μὲν ἄρσενες κατὰ στέγας
θακοῦσιν ἱστουργοῦντες . . . .

57. Horrida qzcalefacit] ‘Such as a dirty
slave girl makes sitting on her codex: which
was a log of wood that slaves were some-
times compelled to wear tied to their leg by
way of punishment. Propertius, iv. 7. 43,
says:

“Nostraque quod Petale tulit ad monu-
menta coronas,
Codicis immundi vincula sentit anus.”

'In Plautus (Poen. v. 3. 39), quoted by
Foreellini and the commentators for this
sense, M elphio only means he will send the
slaves to cut wood ι

“ --111105 ego jam detrudam ad molas;
Inde porro ad puteum atque ad robustum
codicem.”

‘Pellex ’ is one who, being unmarried, had
intercourse with a married man. She was
so called with respect to the man’s wife.
(See Foreellini.) Here therefore the pu-
nishment may be supposed to be inflicted
by a jealous mistress, as the Scholiast says.
ἕδραι ἄτιμοι, 511011 as sitting in the stoeks,
were common punishments of the milder
sort among the Greeks and Romans, as
casaubon shows in his note on Sueton.
Au .24.

58. tabulas impleverit Hister] This man,
if it is the same, he calls below Hister Pa-
cuvius (xii. 111), where he is a will-hunter,
but here he makes his own will and makes
his freedman who had served his lust ‘heres
ex asse‚’ the heir of all his property. As to
‘ tabulas: see note 011 1. 68. Ηο gave large
sums of money to his wife before his death
to let his filthy practices go on. As to
‘ puellae' for married women, compare Hor.
C. iii. 14. 10: ‘ Vos ο pueri et puellae ι111111
virum expertae? ‘Virgines' are used in the
same way in the same stanza, and 111 C. ii.
8. 23, ‘nuper Virgines nuptae.'

61. donantareanacylinclros] Thereward
of secreey is jewels. ‘ Cylindri' were stenes
cut in this shape. See Pliny, H. N. xxxvii.
5 : “ Cylindros ex beryllo facere malunt
