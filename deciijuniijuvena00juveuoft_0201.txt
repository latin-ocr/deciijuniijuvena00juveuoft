SATIRA Vl. 151

Adventum, nisi se centum lustraverit ovis

Et xerampelinas veteres donaverit ipsi,

I‘t quidquid subiti et magni discriminis instat
In tunicas eat et totum semel expiet annum.
Hibernuni fracta glacie descendet in amnem,

Ter matutino Tiberi mergetur et ipsis

Verticibus timidum caput abluet ; inde superbi
Totum reg-is agrum nuda ac tremebunda cruentis
Erepet genibus, si eandida. jusserit 103

Ibit ad Aegypti finem calidaque petitas

A Meroe portabit aquaS, ut spargat in aedem
Isidis, antiquo quae proxima surgit Ovili.

Credit enim ipsius dominae se voce moneri:

En animam et mentem cum qua di nocte loquantur!

Et dare sacratis oscula liminibus;
Non ego tellurem genibus perrepere sup-

house, and when the woman consults him
talks big, in a loud voice. As to the dan-
gers ofautumn see Horace, C. ii. 14. 15:

‘¹ Frustra per auctumnos nocentem plex‚
corporibus metuemus Ausn'um’„ Et miserum saneto tundere poste ea-
put.''

and above, S. iv. 56, “jam letifero cedente
pruinis Auctumno.” About eggs used in lus-
trations see Persius, S. v. 185. The woman
was to buy safety for a year at the eost of a
hundred eggS, and to cast off all fear of
coming dangem with her clothes, The
colour of the clothes he calls ‘xerampe-
linae’ is that of dry vine-leaves, but in
what stage of decay, and therefore of what
colour, is not to be determined. The
Scholiast says the colour was “intra coe-
cinum et muricem‚” between scarlet and
purple.

523. Ter matutino Tiberi] These to v.
541 are the votaries of the Egyptian wor-
ship. Persius speaks of such infatuation
(ii. 15) : '

“Haec sancte ut poscas Tiberino in gur-
gite mergis
Mane eaput bis terque, et noctem flumine
purgas.

Horace, too, makes a mother vow to Jove
that if her child recovers he shall stand
naked in the Tiber, S. ii. 3. 289, n.

524. inde superbi Totum reyz's agrum]
That is, the Campus Martius, which was
the property of Tarquinius Superbus, and
after his expulsion was dedicated to Mars
by Brutus (Livy, ii. 5). The penance here
described appears to have been common.
T ibullus says (i. 2. 83, sqq.):

therever superstition is found this absur-
dity is practised‚ or others like it.

526. si candida jusserit Io ,·] In later
times the Argive divinity, Io, came to be
confounded with the Egyptian Isis, and the
names arc here used as identical. Hero-
dotus distinguishes them, though he gives a
reason which may account for the con-
fusion, τὺ ’γὰρ τῆς Ἴσιος ἄγαλμα ἐὸν γυ-
ναικήϊον βούκερών ἐστι, κατάπερ ἽΞλληνες
τὴν Ἰοῦν γράφουσι (ii. 41). 10 represented
the moon ; and Isis it appears did so, but
not originally. She was also identified with
Demeter. The intercourse between the
Greeks and Egyptians led to the, partial
identification of their divinities and the im-
porting of Egyptian worship into Greece,
from whence, or from Greek colonies, they
passed to Rome. ‘ Candida ' refers to the
story of the white cow into which Io was
changed. The principal temple of Isis was
in the Campus Martius (where she was
called Isis Campensis), and therefore J uve-
nal speaks of it as ‘antiquo proxima Ovili?
The Ovile was an enclosure into which the
people went to vote at the ‘ comitia centu-
rista? The kingdom of Meroe lay between
the Nile and the Astaboras, one of its
Aethiopiam tributaries. It eorresponds in
part to the modern Sennaar.
