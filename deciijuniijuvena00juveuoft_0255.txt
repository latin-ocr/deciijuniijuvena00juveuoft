‘ to repeat! Here it is to visit again and
again (see Porcell.). As to ‘popinae' see
note on Hor. S. ii. 4. 62, where he calls them
⁴ immundae‚' and elsewhere ‘ unctae‚’ Epp. i.
14. 21. They were frequented chiefly by
the lowest classes, 5ο the host here puts on
his best aix-s when the gentleinan pays him
a visit. All this about the genteel coac-h-
man and his low company is familiar to
most of ns.

159. Syrophoean· udus amomo] The
host always runs out to meet him with
a box of ointment such as the luxurious
commonly put on their hair when they sat
down to meals. The people of Coelesyria
and Phoenice were called Syrophoenieians.
They contained among them remnants of
the earliest inhabitants, The woman who
iscalled a Syrophoenician hythe Evangelist
St. Mark (vii. 26), is called by St. Matthew
a Canaanite (xv. 22). This Syrophoenician
is said to be an inhabitant of a town of
Idumaea, which is perhaps here meant for
J udaea. ‘ Porta’ is used for a place through
which traffic passeS‚ as in xi. 124, ‘⁶ porta
Syenes.'’ But I doubt if this verse is
genuine. It seems to me frigid and useless.
It is‘wanting only in one MS. 3 while some
others compound the two verses, omitting
‘udus—Syrophoenix,' which gives no sense.
Idumaea properly is the equivalent for
Edom, and therefore included only the
country inhabited by the Edomites, which
was from the southern border of Canaan to
Mount Horeb in Arabia. In later times
Idumaea extended to Hebron on the north.
The chief town was Petra, a place of great
traffic with Rome and other eountries.
[Ribbeck has

‘—-- amomo
Currit Idumaeo, Syrophoenix &c.’]

161. Hospitis affectu] With all the air
of a host he salutes his customer us My
Lord and King, and the hostess bustles in

with wine. ‘ Lagena ' and ‘ amphora ’ are
the same vessel. ‘ Venali ' only means he
must pay for it, and a good price too per·
haps. The innkeepers knew how to charge
in those days as in these. Τ118 rich it
would seem liked the title of ‘ regeS,' which
was given them with some contempt in
Horace's time. As to ‘succincta' see S.
iv. 24. It means that the woman is officious
when the great man eomes.

163. dicet] [Ribbeck has ‘ dicat.']

164. Desisti nempe,] ‘ But of course
you have left them off.’ ‘ Nempe ’ is formed
from ‘ nam ' and ‘ pe ' (which is the same as
‘que' probably), as ‘quippe ' from ‘quia,’
and they mean ‘ surely,’ ‘ of course’ (v.

166. barba ς] See vi. 214, n.

167. Lateranus] Most MSS. have Da-
masippus, which the Scholiast mentions as
a variant. P. has Lateranus. See 147, n.

168. Thermarum calices] ‘ Thermae '
here is the same as ‘ thermopolium.' Hot
wine and water was a favour-ite drink with
the Romans, and it was sold at these ‘ po-
pinae‚' where the food and drink were con-
sumed on the premiseS‚ not supplied to be
taken home, as from ‘cauponae’ Lipsius
(Elect. i. 4) has a chapter on these warm
drinks and the shops where they were sold.
Both he and Becker (Gallus, Exc. on the
Inns) suppose the ‘ popinae ³ and ‘ thermo·
polia' to be identical. lVe have ‘ calidae
popinae' in S. xi. 81. ‘ Thermopolium ' is
only found in Plautus, who uses it several
times, and he also uses ‘ thermopotare’ (Trin.
iv. 3. 7). ‘ Inscripta lintea ' has been va-
riously explained. Τ118 Scholiast explains
it by ‘vela popinae‚' ‘the eurtain of the
tavern ς’ and casaubon on Suetonius, vit.
Neronis, c. 27, explains it so, quoting Dion
Cassius (79. 13), who, describing the profli-
gate vagaries ot the Emperor Elagabalus,
says he had a room in the palace at the door

of which he stood naked like the prostitutos,
