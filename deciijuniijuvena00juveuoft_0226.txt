D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Dicturus dubia pro libertate bubulco

J udice.

Rumpe miser tensum jecur, ut tibi lasso

Figantur virides scalarum gloria palmae.
Quod vocis pretium? siccus petasunculus et vas

Pelamydum, aut Veteres Afrorum epimenia bulbi,

120

Aut vinum Tiberi devectum, quinque lagenae,

Si quater egisti.

Si contigit aureus unus,

Inde cadunt partes ex foedere pragmaticorum.

He means that
ignorant rude people were likely to be
among the ‘judices' They were chosen
from among the senators and ‘equites,’
both of which orders included during the
empire persons of low birth. The ‘ causi-
dicus' is supposed to be defending one
whose freedom is at stake, who is claimed
as a slave. Heinrich thinks ‘bubulco'
may be a proper name. It was a cog-
nomen of the Junia gens, aud the only
two 011 record who bore it were also called
Brutus. If it be a proper name, it can here
only be a play upon the word it is derived
from.

118. scalarum Ι91ονἱα palmae] Gran-
gaeus quotes Martial (vii. 28) 2

116. bubulco Judiee]

“ Sic fora mirentur, sic te Palatia laudent,
Excolat et geminas plurima palma
fores,''

with Lucan, Claudian, Ausonius, to show
that these lawyers used to hang palm-
branches over their doors when they gained
an important cause. Juvenal means by
‘ scalaru1n,' that the man lived upstairs in
a ‘ coenaculum,' a poor man’s lodging. See
above, S. iii. 166, 1993 and Martial, i. 118,
“ scalis habito tribus sed altis.'’

119. Quod vocis pretium ?] He asks
what the man is to get for the 050 of his
lungs ς and adds, a small dry flitch of bacon,
or a pot of little fish, 01· some old roots,
such as the black slaves got for their rations
(epimenia), or a few jars, less than half a
dozen, of bad wine, and that only after he
has given his services four times. ‘ Petas-
uneulus³ is a small ‘petaso‚' which For-
cellini describes as “ea pars suis quae ab
alis incipit et costas comprehendit‚” which
is a flitch. Pliny (ix. 15), speaking of the
thuuny fish, says that in the spring they
go from the Mediterranean into the
Euxine and there spawn 3 that the name of
the young fish is ‘ eordyla,' but when they
come with the grown fish back to the Medi-
terranean in the autumn they are called

‘pelamides' till they are a year old, following
Aristotle (Hist. Au. vi. 17) : Pliny gets the
name from πηλός, mud. The allowance of
grain or other food to slaves was served
to them sometimes daily and sometimes
mouthly 3 111 the former case it was called
‘diaria,' and in the latter ‘ menstrua: or,
after the Greek, ‘epimenia' See Horace,
Epp. i. 14. 40 z “Cum servis urbana diaria
rodere mavis.” The black slaves of Mauri-
tania have been mentioned before, S. v. 52.
The wine of the north, which 110 11103115
by ‘ vinum Tiberi devectum,’ was not good.
The ‘ lagena ³ was the same as the ‘ testa?
‘cadus,' ‘ amphora? [Ribbeck and Jahn
have ‘ Maurorum epimenia.']

122. Sc· contigit aureus unus‚] If he
happens to meet with an unusually liberal
client, and gets an ‘aureus,' part of that
goes to the ‘ pragmatici ' by agreement.
An ‘ aureus ’ of this time was of the value of
25 denarii, or 173. 85d„ if the value of the
denarius be taken at ὃὲά. It is usual to
place it at 75d. after the time of Augustus,
but the other is perhaps right. (See Dict.
Ant. ‘ Aurum,' ‘ Denarius.’) In B.c. 204 a
‘ plebiscitum' was passed, prohibiting any
person from taking a fec for pleading a
cause. This was called Cincia lex, after
M. Cincius Alimentus who was ‘tribunus
plebis ' that year. This was confirmed by
a ‘ senatusconsultum’ 111 the time of
Augustus3 but was relaxed 111 that of Clau-
dius, after which time a man might take 10
sestertia for a fec, which would be nearly
901. (See Dict. Ant. ‘ Cineia Lex.') ‘ Prag-
matici ' were persons who helped the advo-
cates with legal information in court. The
name was taken from the Greeks, who em-
ployed that sort of practitioner : ‘ apud
Graecos infimi homines mercedula adducti
ministros se praebent in judiciis oratori-
bus,’ as Cicero says (De Or. 1. 45). See
also Quintilian (Inst. xii. 3). The Romans
did not hold them in much estimation.

They were called ‘tabelliones’ from the
tablets they carried.
