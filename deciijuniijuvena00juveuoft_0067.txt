Sed quum summus honor finito computet auno
Sportula quid referat, quantum rationibus addat,
Quid facient comites‚quil>11shine toga, calceus hinc est

Languida vel praegnans et circumducitur uxor.

Ostendens vacuam et clausam pro conjug-e sellam.

ing here. M. has it in the 111. irgin. It pro-
bably arose from Ov id' s‘ ‘crepitante ciconia
ros‘r0” (Met. vi. 97).

117. Sed quum autumus honor] “But
when the highest magistrates take account
at thc end of the year what the‘ sportuh’
brings them in, and how much it adds to
their income, what will their followers do
who get every thing, clothes, and victuals,
and firing (fumusque) from that source ‘?'’
‘ Referre’ is the proper word for entering
money in an account book, and ‘rationes '
are the accounts themselves.

119. Quid facient comitam] That is,
those parasites whose profession it was to
wait upon the rich. See abov‚e v. 46.

120. 1)εωίεεὶ ma cenlum Quadranles]
See note on v. 95. ‘Densissima lectica' is
equivalent to· plurima lectica.’ Men are
not satisfied with going themselves, but
they must take their wives with them to
get a double allowance, though they be sick
or in the familv way. Another takes his
wife's empty chair, w ith the curtains drawn
round. “'It s mv wife’ 5 Gallass' says he;

‘we are in a hurry, don' t detain 1153 “Put
out your head, Galla, that we may see
you' re there,” says the‘ balneator? “Don’t
disturb her, she’s asleep ;'’ and so he takes
a second dole. As to the difference between
‘ lectica' and ‘ sella' see note on v. 64.

127. Ipse dies pulcro] Here follows an
account of the divisione of the day, which
he calls a ‘fair ordei-ing' ironically. The
distribution of the dole 15 the first thingin
the morning, then the great man goes to
the forum and the law courts, and returns
home about (11111131- time, still attended by
his clients, who after seeing him to 1115
(1001, retire wearied, and disappointed, be-
cause he does not ask them to dinner, as
rich men used to do before the‘ sportula'

was invented, As far as it goes this divi-
sion of the day corresponds with Martial’s
(iv. 8). The two first hours, he says, were
given uptothe ¹ salutati0,' the next three to
the courts, the sixth to sleep and the ‘ pran-
dium‚’ the seventh to business again, the
eighth to exercise, and the ninth to dinner,
which went on ad libitum till bed-time.
(See Hor. Epp. i. 7. 47, n.) It is here said
that the ‘ sportula' was the first business.
Becker says the dole itself was taken away
in theasternoon, though t-he ‘salutatio ’ took
place in the morning (Gall. p. 29, n.). We
have a scene below (iii. 249, sqq.) of slaves
carrying away hot viands in the asteruoon ;
and Martia] (x. 70. 13) says he has to go ab
the tenth hour for his bath or his ‘ spor-
tula35 ‘⁶ Balnea post decimam lasso cen·
tumve petuntur Qua‹11·a11tes.” It appears,
therefore, that people could take the earn·
ings of their servility either in the morning
or the asternoon.

128. jurisque peritus Apollo] As to the
Forum Augusti, which is here alluded to,
see Hor. Epp. i. 16. 57, 11. There was 111
it a statue of Apollo inlaid with ivory (Plin.
H. N. vii. 53). In this forum were two
porticos, in one of which were statues of
Aeneas and the Roman kings, and in the
other of distinguished soldiers. Compare
Sueton. (Aug. 31) ε “ Statuas omnium (qui
imperium populi Romani ex minimo maxi-
mum reddidissent) triumphali effigie in
utraque fori sui porticu dedicavit,’' with
Ovid (Fast. v. 563, sqq.) :

“Hinc videt Aenean oneratum pondere sacro
Et tot Iuleae nobilitatis 31ὀ5.
Hinc videt Iliaden humeris ducis arma
ferentem
Claraquedispositis acta subesse viris.’'
