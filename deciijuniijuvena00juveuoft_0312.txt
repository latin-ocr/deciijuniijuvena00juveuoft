D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Lancibus oppositis vel matris imagine fracta,
Et quadringentis nummis condire gulosum

Fictile.

Sic veniunt ad miscellanea ludi.

Refert crgo quis haec eadem paret ς in Rutilo nam
Luxuria est, in Ventidio laudabile nomen

Sumit et a censu famam trahit.

Illum ego jure

Despiciam qui scit quanto sublimior Atlas

Omnibus in Libya sit montibus, hie tamen idem

Ignoret quantum ferrata distet ab arca

Ε 03010 descendit «γνῶθι σεαυτόν,

Figendum et memori tractandum pectore, sive
Conjugium quaeras vel sacri in parte Senatus

(S. ix. 145, 0.) whose work this statuette
or bust of the man's mother might be.
His made dish was to eost upwards of
three guineaS. ‘ Gulosum 1101110,’, 1110 dish
of the glutton. It is now of earthenware,
but he does not mind that. Ruperti says
about the mother's statue, “ fracta ex in-
dustria utnon cognosci possit et sine pudore
vendi.'’ WVliere does he get this Ρ lt
may have been broken by carelessness.
The man is not supposed to care much
about the image, though it is 1115 10011101·’5.

20. miscellanea ludi] ‘Miscellanea’ is a
mess of all sorts of things, as the Scholiast
explains it. Having spent al] he had to
spend, the man 0011105 10 put up with
gladiators' fare. ‘ Ludus’ is the lanista’s
school. ‘ Ludi' is not for ‘ludii,’ as Ru-
perti says (vi. 82).

21. Refert eryo quis haee eadem paret ς]
‘ Ergo ’ is as I said, going back to v. 1 (see
x. 44, n.: “ Ergo supervacua,” δια). ‘ Re-
fert' (rem fert) it makes adifference. ‘Haec
eadcm' is these said dainties. Ventidius
is put as Atticus was for any wealthy per-
son. Ventidius Cumanus was procurator
of Judaea 111 1110 reign of Claudius, and
we have had another Ventidius above (vii.
199). The name must have represented a
rich family, or Juvenal would not have
used it. ‘Laudabile nomen' is represented
in ‘lautus,' v. 1. For ‘sumit’ Heinrich
would read ‘ sumptus ³ to get a. subject for
⁴ est’ and ‘trahit‚' and to avoid the tau-
tology in ‘nomen suniit' and ‘famam tra·
hit? Some tautology may be allowed.
It is not much, and ‘a censu' makes the
second clause explanatory of the first. The
subject of the three verbs is contained in
‘ haec eadem paret.5 Ruperti says ‘ Luxu-
ria a censu famam trahit‚' which is wrong.
In Rutilus the thing is luxury, in Ven-
tidius it takes a credit-able name.

25. hie tamen idem anoret] “ While he,
the very same man, knows not the great
difl'erence between a little bag aud an iron-
bound chest.” He 1135 learnt at school
that Atlas is the highest mountain range
in Africa, but does not know the great
distance between his means and those of
Ventidius and the like. Heinrich rightly
explains the use of the subjunctive in
‘ignoret' as above. Horace makes the
rich patron reprove his humble friend thus:

‘⁶ —— meae (contendere noli)
Stultitiam patiuntur opes 3 tibi parvula res
Arptiit 'decet sanum comitem toga ς desine
'mecum

Certare.'' (Epp. i. 18. 28.)

And he makes Damasippus taunt him with
the fable of the frog and the bull because
he was building himself a house as Maece-
nas was doing :

“ Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris ab imo
Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis.—
An quodcunque facit Maecenas te quoque
Taxffiluusslnffisssimssem et tanto certare mi-

norem ?” (S. 0 3. 308, sqq.)

Juvenal speaks of ‘ambitiosa paupertas’
pervading all classes (iii. 182). See Pers.
iv. 52:
tibi curta supelleX.”
σεαυτὸν 15 attributed to each of the seven
wise men, to Pythagoras, to Socrates, and
to the Delphic oracle, to which or other
divine source Juvenal ascribes it.

29. Conjuyz'um quaeras] Grangaeus
quotes as a wise man’s saying the words of
a woman wise too late. Deianira says
(ovid, Heroid. ix. 29, sqq.):

“Tecum habita, noris quam sit
The saying ’γνῶθι
