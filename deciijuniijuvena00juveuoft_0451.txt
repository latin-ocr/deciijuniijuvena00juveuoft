SATIRA ΙΙΙ.

401

Pingue, caret culpa, nescit quid perdat, et alto
Demersus summa rursus non bullit in ulula.

Magne pater divum, saevos punire tyrannos

35

Haud alia ratione velis, cum dira libido
Moverit ingenium ferventi tincta veneno z
Virtutem videant intabescantque relicta.
Anne magis Siculi gemuerunt aera juvenci,

Et magis auratis pendens laquearibus ensis

Purpureas subter cervices terruit, “ Imus,
Imus p1·aecipiteS,’' quam si sibi dicat, ct intus
Palleat infelix quod proxima nesciat uxor‘.>
Saepe oculos, memini, tangebam parvus olivo,

Grandia si nollem morituri verba Catonis

Dicere, non sano multum laudanda magistro,
Quae pater adductis sudans audiret amicis.
Jure etenim id summum, quid dexter senio ferret

a defect of nature, ‘culpa ’ a fault of cou-
duct, or error of judgment. See Hor. S.
ii. 6. 7, n., “Nec suin facturus vitio cul-
pave minorem.'’ ‘ Hic ’ is such as Natta.
He says such a inan is stupid from
natural viciousness, his heart is gross‚ hc
cannot be blamed, for he knows not what
he is throwing away, he is like one who
siuks and never rises again. But the
man he is speaking to has no such excuse,
for he knows what virtue is, and yet
deserts her; and there is no greater pun-
ishment he can pray Jove to visit upon
the most savage tyrants than this, that
they should see the image of virtue and
waste away with the conseiousness of
having abandoned her. This passage is
very fine. The dolt who has no con-
science is well described, and the misery
of an acute conscience still better. The
brazen bullis that of Phalaris, in which
its inventor, Perinus, was the first to
suffer (Juv. viii. 81). The sword is that
which Dionysius hung over Damocles’
head to give him a taste of regal happi-
ness, and of which Horace says :

‘¹ Districtus ensis cui super impia
Cervice pendet non Siculae dapes
Dulcem elaborabunt saporem,
Non avium citharaeque cautus

Somnum reducent.''
(C. iii. 1. 17, sqq.)

44. Saepe oeulos, memini,] He used
often at the rhetoric school to rub his eyes
with olive oil to make himself look ill,

that he might get off declaiming. How
the oil would have that effect 1 do not
know. He supposes the subject to be the
last speech of Cato of Utica (of which
Addison's version is suffieiently hack-
neyed in our schools), and says the silly
master would applaud him loudly, and
his father attend, in spite of the hcat of a
crowded room, with a party of friends.
See note on Juv. vii. 165, “Quantum vis
stipulare et protinus accipe quod do Ut
toties illum pater audiat.’' Some say the
father would sweat with nervousneSS.
That would add to the other cause, but
we know what crowds can be gathered
on speech days, to witness a very silly
exhibition. There is sufficient authority
for ‘dicere' (46), which Heinrich has.
Most MSS. and the other editors have
‘discere.’

48. Jure etenim id summum] He says
this was only natural at that age, that he
should like to pla’y at dice, to pitch into a
'jar, and turn the whipping-top. ‘Senio ’
is the six, and ‘canicula’ or ‘ canis ' is the
ace. The throw called Venus implied
the use of several dice when all the faces
turned up were different. This was the
highest thu-ow. See Hor. C. ii. 7. 25,
“quem Venus arbitrum dicct bibendi.”
‘ Quid . . . ferret ’ is how much it brought
in to his store ; ‘quantum raderet' is how
much it took from it. 'l‘hc Scholiast here
and Pollux (ix. 7. 103, quoted by Casan-
bon) tell us it was a common sport to
throw nuts or bones (ἀστραγάλους) into a
