SATIRA III.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS Satire contains as fine writing and as much power of condensed expression, with-
out great obscurity, as any that Juvenal has written. There is not the same breadth
and scope in Persius’ writings as in J uvenal's, but some of the passages in this poem
Juvenal has not, I think, surpassed. The reader will judge for himself.

The poet begins with eomplaining of the habit of young men wasting their time in
(lebauchery at night, and in bed in the morning 3 and then supposes a scene in which a
youth is lying in bed as usual tilla late honr, and one of his companions comes and wakes
him. He starts up in a rage, abuses his servants, dresseS‚ and goes off to his work. In·
stead of writing what he has to write, 118 begins abusing his pens and his ink 3 ‘where-
upon the poet takes him up, and reads him a lesson upon iffleness, pride, and debauchery;
telling him he is old enough to know better than to waste his time like a schoolboy ς
that he has not the excuse of a vicious, gross nature, and of those who are hardened 111
their ignorance ; and that if conscience lays hold of him he will find its tortures worse
than all that tyranny ever invented. In all of this there is much solemn wisdom and
grave though vigorous reproof. He treats the man as a weak child, with his excuses
and his premmption, and bids him go back to his nursery and his pap, or go to the
potter's and get turned again, as a pot that has been made of soft watery clay. The con-
dition of one who is falling into despair, with fears in his bosom too great for his wife
to know, is described in a few terrible words, and the severity of his punishment is
excellently told.

The above imaginary scene occupies half the satire. The other half 15 more general.
It teaches us to begin early, before life has become tainted and medicine of no avail, to
study the nature and end of our being, our relation to others, and our duty to God. Let
us get wisdom, and despise the gains of the worldly and the ridicule of the vulgar.
The coarse wit of the soldiers at the expense of the philosophers, and their sels-com-
placency in 1118 contemplation of their own ignorance, are represented in the best style
