D. J UNII J UVENALIS

Mole piger, nec finitima nutritus in herba,

Laeta sed ostendens Clitumni pascua sanguis

Iret, et a grandi cervix ferienda ministro,

Ob reditum trepidantis adhuc horrendaque passi 15
Nuper et incolumen sese mirantis amici.

Nam praeter pelagi casus et fulg-uris ictus

Evasit.

Densae caelum abscondere tenebrae

Nube una subitusque antennas impulit ignis,

Quum se quisque illo percussum crederet et mox

Attonitus nullum conferri posse putaret

Naufragium velis ardentibus.

Omnia fiunt

Talia, tam graviter, si quando poetica surgit

Tempestas.

14. α grandi cervixferietzda ministra]
Among the Greeks the victim was killed by
the officiating priest. With the Romans
this duty was performed by a person who
bore the title of ‘ popa ' (Persius vi. 73, n.).
It was the practice first to strike the victim
on the head with a hammer to stun it, and
theuto cut the throat, or chop the neck with
311 axe. Suetonius says of Caligula that he
acted as ‘ popa ' on one occasion, and made
the poor wretch who should have eut the
animal's throat the victim (c. 32): “Ad-
mota altaribus victima succinctus poparum
habitu elato alte malleo cultrarium macta-
vit ;'' where ‘ cultrarius' was the popa's
deputy. The victim was ‘ mactata ’ after
the blow of the hammer, which was ad-
ministered by the ‘ popa :³ the ‘cultrarius'
probably was a lower officer who finished
the business. Juvenal speaks of him as a
burly fellow‚ ‘ grandi.' See S. vii. 210.

15. trepidantis adhuc] Though the dan-
ger was past he was still trembling at the
remembrance of what he had lately gone
throu 11.

17.ᾖ“ιιῖ91ινῐ.ς ictus Evasit] The Scholiast
had ‘fulminis ictus‚’ and so has P. Most
MSS. have ‘ fulguris,’ which probably was
changed to ‘fulminis ' because of ‘ ictus ε’
but that expression is as proper as ‘impulit
ignis.’ P. and two other MSS. have ‘ eva-
sit.’ Nearly all have ‘evasi ' with a different
punctuation, which Ruperti has followed.
Heinrich and Jahn have ‘ evasit‚' which is
the simplest.

19. impulit iynis‚] This probably refers
to the meteoric fiashes known in the Medi-
terranean as the fire of St. Elmo, as ex-
plained on Horace, C. i. 3. 2: “ Sic fratres
Helenae lucida sidera.'’ The flashes‚ he

says, seemed to set the sails on fire, and
the passeugers all thought they themselves
were struck, and that no shipwreck could
be so bad as the burning of the vessel. As
to ‘attonitus ' see xiv. 306, n.

23. si quando poetica surgit] This is
the reading of nearly all the MSS. Jahn
from a conjecture of Schurzfleiseh, whose
MS. omits ‘ si,' reads ‘ quam quando.5 J u-
venal says when a storm gets up in poetry
all the incidents are the same and as ter-
rible as in this storm. The other reading
only reverses the order. But there is no
authority or necessity for it.

24. Genus ecce aliud discriminis ;] ⁴ But
here is another kind of danger,’ which he
relates at v. 30, introducing it with a little
mock seriousness and a parenthesis about
pietures of wrecks. The practice of ship-
wrecked sailors hanging up pictures in the
temples (of Isis in particular) is often al-
luded to. See note on Hor. C. i. 5. 13.

Me tabula sacer
Votiva paries indicat uvida
Suspendisse potenti
Vestimenta maris Deo.’'

 

They also carried such pictures about to
get pity aud aluis. See xiv. 301, sq.
What Juvenal says is “ here is another sort
of danger: listen and pity him again:
though what follows is only a part of the
same bad luck, terrible indeed, but familiar
to many, and one which many a temple
with its votive picture testifies to: for who
does not know that the painters get their
living by Isis P A like misfortune then befell
our Catullus :³³ and then he goes on to say
what it was ε the throwing over of his goodS,
which no doubt would be introduced in
