D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nam quid tam miserum, tam solum vidimus, ut non
Deterius eredas horrere incendia, lapsus

Tectorum assiduos ac mille pericula saevae

Urbis et Augusto recitantes mense poetas?

Sed dum tota domus rheda componitur una,

lo

Substitit ad veteres arcus madidamque Capenam.
Hic, ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae,
Nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra locantur

J udaeis‚ quorum cophinus foenumque supellex.

Omnis enim populo mercedem pendere jussa est

mation, lyirg between the island Aenaria
(Ischia) and Cape Misenum. It appears at
that time to have been a louely place, but
it is now well cultivated and populous. Ser-
vius (on Virgil ix. 715, “ tum sonitu Pro-
chyta alta tremit”) says the island derived
its name from the verb προχύειν, because it
was cast off from its neighbour; and he
accounts for Virgil calling it ‘ alta' (whereas
it lies low) from its once having formed
part of Aenaria, which is lofty. This is not
worth much. Suburra or Subura was the
name of a low street leading from the Es—
quiline to the Viminal, the St. Giles's of
Rome. (Hor. Epod. v. 57, u.) As to the
orthography, 588 Quinct. i. 7. 28. Juvenal
speaks of the town as if it. was all one
Suburra.

9. Any-usto recitantes mense poetas ἲ]
See S. i. init. It was bad enough at any
time 3 but in August, the hottest mouth of
the year, it might be reckoned, in a jocular
way,- among “ the thousand dangers of the
barbarous town.'’

10. rheda componiluruna,] The ‘rheda’
was a four-whecled travelling cai-riage‚ such
as Horace travelled in part of the way to
Brundisium (S. i. 5. 86. See note on S.
ii. 6. 42).

11. veteres arcus madidamque Capenam]
The ‘ porta Capena' was that from which
the Via Appia began, in the southern quar-
tcr of the city. It led to Capua, from which
it probably got its name. The Aqua Appia,
the earliest aqueduct at Rome, constructed
by the Censor Appius who made the mad,
was conducted on arches over the Porta
Capena, which is therefore called ‘madida‚'
as the Scholiast says, and he adds that they
called the gate in 1115 time ‘arcum stillan-
tem,' the dripping arch. Martial has an
epigram (iii. 47) beginning “Capena grandi
porta qua pluit gutta.’' The arches which
Juvenal calls ‘veteres' were about 400 years

{gat that time, having been built A.U.c.

12. Hic, ubi nocturnae] This and the
four following verses Jahn puts after v. 20,
against all the MSS. [Ribbeck does the
same] ‘Constituo’ is used absolutely for
making an appointment as we say, either
with a dative of the person or an ablative
with ‘cum.' See Forcellini for examples.
The nature of the appointment is usually
expressed. Here it is easily understood.
The grove where Numa is said to have met
his mistress and teacher Aeg-cria was close
to the Porta Capena (Plutarch, Num. e. 13).
It had a fountain in it (Livy 1. 21). Numa
was said to have built a shrine there, and
to have dedicated the whole to the Camenae,
of whom Aegeria was one. The wood and
fountain of Aegcria, in the valley of Aricia,
about fifteen miles from Rome, are con-
nected with a different legend, and must
not be confounded with those under the
walls of Rome. It appears that the Jews
011 payment of a certain rent were allowed
to inhabit this place when they were for-
bidden the city, as they were during the
reign of Domitian. They were so poor that
he says their whole furniture consisted in a
basket and a bed of hay. They were not
allowed to trade, and were driven it appears
to beg (see vi. 542, sq.).

15. Omnis enim populo] These two lines
Ruperti puts in a parenthesis, with a comma
after ‘ supellex,’ joining ¹ In vallem Aegei-iae
descendimus ’ with ‘ hic’ in v. 12. The
editors have given themselves unnecessary
trouble about the arrangement. It does
very well as it stands in the text. They
got the utmost rent from the poor wretches.
‘ Merces ' is the proper word for rent (Ho-
race, S. ii. 2. 115, “fortem mercede colo-
num,” and the passage from the Digest
quoted 111 the note). Suetonius says Domi-
tian was very severe in collecting the taxes
from the Jews. “ J udaicus fiscus acerbis-
sime actus est'’ (c. 12). A poll-tax of two
drachmae was levied from all Jews and
Christians throughout the empire.
