Per famam et populum nigros efferre maritos.

Ande aliquid brevibus G yaris et carcere dignum,

Si vis esse aliquis: probitas laudatur et alget.

Criminibus debent hortos, praetoria, mensas, 75
Argentum vetus et stantem extra pocula caprum.

Quem patitur dormire nurus corruptor avarae,

Quem sponsae turpes et praetextatus adulter?

Si natura negat⁴ facit indignatio versum,

72. Persamam et populum] This forms
one subject, in the midst of the whispers or
talking of the citizens. 1t seems, therefore,
that the corpse was carried out with the
sace exposed.

73. bret-ibus Gyaris] This was a small
barren island (still called Giura) iu the Ae-
gean, one of the Cyclades, to which a few
of the worst sort of criminals were trans-
ported in the time of the empire. &Vhou it
was proposed that Silanus should be seut
thither, Tiberius to show his clemency chose
another place of banishment for him, sayiug
thatGyara(or Gyarus) ‘¹ insulam immitem et
sine cultu hominum esse’' (TacAnn. iii. 69).
It was ill supplied with water(‘egena aquaez'
ib.iv.30); audit was little better than death
to be sent there. See vi. 5633 x. 170. ‘ Bre-
vibus ’ is equivalent to ‘ parvis?

74. probitas laudatur et ὠμῇ] These
words are often quoted and imitated. Gif-
ford quotes from Massinger's Fatal Dowry
(Act ii. sc. 1):

“ In this partial, avarieious age,
What price bears honour P virtue Ρ long
avo
It wasobut praised and freezed ι but now-a-
days
'Tis colder far, and has nor love nor praise.”

John of Salisbury (Policr. iii.9) quotes these
words : “ Quis Themistoclis diligentiam,
Frontonis gravitatem, continentiam So-
cratis, Fabricii fidem, innocentiam Numae,
pudicitiam Scipionis, longanimitatem Ulys-
sis, Catonis parcitatem, Titi pietatem imita-
tur ? quis non cum admiratione veneratur Ρ
probitas siquidem laudatur et alget.'' For
‘ aliquis,' some of the MSS. have ‘ aliquid ;’
but the masculine is right. Persius has it
(i. 129), “ seque aliquem credens ;'’ and
Cicero (Ad Att. iii. 15, sub iim), “ meque ut
facis velis esse aliquem.’' The Greeks used
τις in the same way 3 and the same is com-
mon in most languages. To be ‘⁶ somebody ’²
is the great object ot¹ ambition with half the
world.

75. praeterim] Fine houses fit for an
emperor (x. 161). As to the Roman tables

and their vessels of silver and bronze, sec
Hor. S. i. 4. 28, n.; ii. 2. 4, n.

76. stantem est-tra pocula caprum] The
Scholiast quotes Martial (viii. 51. 9) : “Stat
caper Aeolio Thebani vellere Phrixi Cul-
tu.‹.” Grangaeus asks, not with his usual
j udgment, whether ‘stantem ' means ‘⁵ pedi-
bus crectis ut solent pascere caprae, au
eminentem?'’ It means standing out iu
bold relies, as in Ovid (Met. xii. 235):

·‘ Forte fuit juxta signis extantibus asper
Antiquus crater.''

⁸ Starc’ is occasionally used in this sense
absolutely, as in Hor. C. i. 9. 1 : “ Vides ut
alta stet nive candidum Soracte,'' ‘see you
how white Soracte with deep snow stands
out' (see note). Such figures ou cups,
&c.‚ when they were moveable, were called
‘ emblemata‚’ after the Greek. (Sec v. 38,
and the note.) On the ancient Greek ves-
sels they were very haudsome and carious.
Verres the governor of Sicily laid his hands
upon many. Cicero calls them ‘scyphos
sigillatos,' cups with ‘ signa,' or earved
figures upon them (Verr. ii. 4. 1-1-. See
Long's note). The art, though continued
till the latter years of the Roman republic,
was suddenly dropped, as l'lin)v says (H. N.
xxxiii. 12). The latest artist of the kind
whom he mentions, and whom he calls a
‘crustarius‚' of note, >was named Teucer,
no doubt a Greek.

78. praeteoetatus adullam-Q Heinrich and
Madvig take this for a boy paramour, who
has learnt his lesson of viee before he has
put on the ‘toga virilis? It may be so.
Compare ii. 170 : ‘⁴ Sic praetextatos referunt
Artaxata mores.'' There is more force in
this than in taking the words for a senator,
or others who wore the ‘toga praetcxta‚’
concerning which see Dict. Ant„ and
Hor. S. i. 5. 34, n. As to ‘ sponsae,’ sce iii.
111, n.

79. saell indi-quatio versum] These
words also are used by John of SMisbury,
whose quotations arc always well chosen
(Nugae, ὕεα, iii. 13): “Disposuerum tamen
silere de mollibus qui sicut ignominiosi ita
