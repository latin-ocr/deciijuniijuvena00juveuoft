D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Dimidia brevior? tantine injuria coenae?

Tam jejuna fames, possis cum honestius illic

10

Et tremere et sordes farris mordere canini?

Primo fige loco, quod tu discumbere jussus
hlercedcm solidam veterum capis officiorum.
Fructus amicitiae magnae cibus : imputat hunc rex,

Et quamvis rarum tamen imputat.

Ergo duos post Ι 5

Si libuit menses neglectum adhibere clientem,
Tertia ne vacuo cessaret culcita lecto,

“ Una simus,” ait.

As to ‘ pons ' see S. iv. 116. ‘ Teges' is a
mat or rug (see below vi. 117; vii. 221).
‘ Dimidia brevior,' too short by half.

9. tantine injuria coenae ἕ] ⁴ Is the inso-
lence of a dinner worth so much Ρ ’ Is it
worth while to accept a dinner only to be
insulted P ‘⁴ Injnriosa coena. Sic Vir-
gilius, ‘injuria cacdis‚’ pro injuriosa caedes.''
This is Grangacus’ note. Heinrich says
from ‘ tantine ' to ¹ fames ’ is a gloss. He
does not say why he thinks so.

10. possis cum honestius] The common
reading is ‘ eum possis 3' but the last syllable
in ‘ possis’ is long. A few MSS„ among
which Ruperti quotes a very old one of
Voss, have ‘ cum possit‚' and my ownjudg-
ment hesitates between that reading and the
one in the text. ‘ Fames' might be the
subject to ‘possit ;’ and that way of speak-
ing is not unnatural, nor too poetical as
Ruperti says. If ‘ possit ’ be the true read-
ing, ‘ possis ’ must have been introduced by
copyists who did not sce that ‘ possit ' de-
pended on ‘ fames‚’ and who preferred bad
prosody to bad syntax. If ‘possis cum
honestins' be right, the words may have
been transposed to avoid an unusual rhythm.
But Horace has ¹‘ cocto num adest honor
idem ?'’ and Terence and Lucretius have the
same colnbination frequently (see note on
Hor. S. ii. 2. 28). Ruperti gives this last
reading to the suggestion of Heinecke.
Heinrich discusses and approves but does
not adopt it. Such eompounds of ‘ circum ¹
as ‘ circulnago‚' ‘ circumeo: contain the
same anomaly, if such it is, Ruperti has
introduced ‘ quum pol sit ' 011 his own an-
thority [and Ribbeck has it]. Jahn has
‘cum possit? Henninius and other old
editions have ‘quin poscis ⁶? ' without
authority. They mean ‘why don't you
beg t> ’

illie] On the ‘crepido' or ‘pons’ ‘ Tre-
mere ' is to shiver with cold, or to pretend
to do so. ‘ Farris canini ’ is bread such as

Votorum summa: quid ultra

is thrown to the dogs. As to ‘fan’ sce
Hor. S. i. 5. 68, 11. Martial has, upon a

certain seurrilous verse-writer (Χ. 5) ε

“ Erret per urbem pontis exul et clivi ;
Interque raucos ultimus rogatores
Oret caninas panis improbi buccas.’'

12. Primofiye loom] ‘Figc' is stronger
than ‘pone’ ‘Set this down and don’t
forget it.' Heinrich says it is ‘ fige animo ε’
ἐμβάλλεο θυμῷ. But Juvenal says ‘put
this in the foremost place.’ M. and some
other MSS. and some early editions have
‘ finge.) ‘ Discuinbere’ is a common word
for reclining at meals (see Forcell ). ‘ Soli-
dus ' is that which has no hollow or vacant
space (Hor. C. i. 1. 20, 11., ‘ solido demere
de die '). ‘ Merces solida' is a payment in
full. ‘ Magnae amicitiae ³ is a common ex-
pression with Juvenal. See S. i. 33; iv.

15. Et quamvis rarum tamen] The
Latin writers used ‘tamen ' much as the
Greeks used ὅμως, as they might say, καὶ
σπάνιον ὅμως (sec note on Hor. C. i. 7.
22 : ‘ cuni fugeret tamen,’ &c.‚ and Long’s
note on Cic. Verr. ii. 2. 73). As to ‘im-
putat‚’ see S. ii. 17, n., and on ‘rex‚’ S. i.

16. adhibere clientem] ‘Adhibere,’ ‘to
have in,’ as we say, is the common word for
invitations. Two MSS„ M. and a Leipzig
Ms„ have ‘ accire‚’ which is the reading of
five of the old editions. The other is the
more usual word, and has the best authority.

18. Una simiam] “Apud me sis volo ’' is
a like phrase for an invitation to dinner in
Terence (Heaut. i. 1. 110). The great
man pays off his obligations to the little
man by inviting him to dinner when he
has a spare place, to fill up the gap; and
he gives him the lowest place on his own
conch, ‘imus lectus,' on which the master
of the house usually lay, with members of
his family, or, in their absence, with his
