SATIRA V II.

Communi feriat carmen triviale moneta,

Hunc qualem nequeo monstrare ct sentio tantum
Anxictate carens animus facit, omnis acerbi
Impatiens, cupidus silvarum aptusque bibendis

Fontibus Aonidum.

Neque enim cantare sub antro
Pierio thyrsumve potest contingere moesta

Paupertas atque aeris inops, quo nocte dieque
Corpus eget: satur est quum dicit Horatius, Euoe!
Quis locus ingenio, nisi quum se carmine solo
Vexant et dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque feruntur

⁴ Deducere ’ is
commonly applied to verse-making, and is
probably taken from spinning, as in Horace,
Epp. ii. 1. 225, “ deducta poemata filo ;''
he also says, “ similesque meorum Mille die
versus deduci posse,’' S. ii. 1. 3. See note
on Horace, S. i. 10. 44: “ forte epos acer
Ut nemo Varius ducit.'’ The works of the
brain are commonly 111 most languages de·
scribed as the coinage of a mint; and Juve-
nal speaks of the man whose ideas are not
coined at the common mint, in which all
manner of base metal is struck, and then
current among the ignorant. The
operations of the Roman mint and the
adulteration of the coinage are related in
the article ‘ Moneta’ in Smith's Dict. Ant.
Private persons could get their gold and
silver coined at the public mint. Bentley
on Horace, A. P. 59, “semperque licebit
Signatum praesente nota producere no·
men,'' quotes this passage among others
to support his alteration, ‘procudere uum-
mum.'
56. sentio tantum] He says he cannot

way, and so is ‘triviale.’

point out such a person; he can only ima· -

gine, or, as he says better, feel him. ‘ Im-
patiens acerbi ’ expresses ἄγευστος πικροῦ,
not impatient, but free from the suffering
of bitterness, which is that of poverty,
disappointment, mortification, and self·
contempt. The Muses had their name
Aonides from Boeotia, anciently called
Aonia. Sec above, v. 6, 11. Bacchus and
the Muses are always close eompanions, and
so he says ‘thyrsum contingere?
says (Epp. ii. 2. 77) ε

“ Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et

fugit urbem,

Rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et
umbra.'’

Horace

58. aptusque bibendis] Jahn 1135 ‘avidus,'
on the authority, he sayS, of the Scholiast,
whose note is “ Impatiens cupidus silvarum

avidus. ut Horatius, Bacchum in remotis
carmina rupibus Vidi doccntem,” where
‘ avidus ' is only a gloss on ⁴ cupidus.’ The
MSS. have ‘ aptus.’

60. moesta] Most MSS. have ‘ sana?
P. and others have ‘ maesta? Some have
‘saeva.' Heinrich has ‘1110esta.’ Ruperti,
Jahn, [Ribbeck‚] and most other editors
‘sana.' [In v. 61 Ribbeck has ‘ quom.']

62. satur est quum. dicit Horatius,
Euoe l] Horace, he says, had all hc wanted
when he sang Euoe ! as

 

Euoe! parce, Liber,
Parce, gravi metuende thyrso !”

(c. ii. 19. 7.)

Ruperti asks how this agrees with what
Horace says of himself (Epp. ii. 2. 51,

sqq.) :

 

paupertas impulit audaxl

Ut versus facerem: sed quod non desit
habentem

Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare

Nicsslelil‘i} dormire putem quam scribere
versus . ''

The answer is that Horace is joking. He
takes a good deal of trouble to show that
he is lazy, for he did not write this epistle,
the best in some respects of all, without
much pains. There is no doubt, as I have
shown, that Horace wrote all his odes aster
he had got a competence ; aud if his poverty
made him write in the first instance, what
he wrote then was of a different character. I
have said enough on this subject elsewhere.

64. dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque] Cirrha
was situated at the head of the bay called
Sinus CrissaeuS, in the Corinthian Gulf.
There are ruins of the town still existing in
a village called Magula. On the high ground
above it was the more ancient city of Orissa,
of which it was the port, and with which
some ancient writers and modern have con-
