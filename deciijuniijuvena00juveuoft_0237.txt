Nutricem Anchisae, nomen patriamque novercae

Archemori, dicat quot Acestes vixerit annos,

Quot Siculus Phrygibus vini donaverit urnas.
Exigitc 111 mores teneros ceu pollice ducat,

Ut si quis cera vultum facit3

exigite ut sit

Et pater ipsius coetus, ne turpia ludant,

Ne faciant vicibus.

father’s Lycurgus. He was king of Nemea,
and iu honour of his son the Nemean Games
were instituted (Apollod. iii. 6. ξ -1). But
virgil, Aen. x. 389, speaks of another. He
was son of an Italian prince Rhoetus, who
married a second wife named Casperia,
and her stepson committed ineest with
her, according to Servius, who gives the
name Anchemolus: and a few MSS. and
many old editions have Anchemoli here.
Ruperti, Jahn [and Ribbeck] have that
name. P. and most MSS. have Arche-
mori. As 1ο Acestes, the Sicilian king
who twice received Aeneas hospitably‚ see
Aen. i. 195:

“Vina bonus quae deinde cadis onerarat
Acestes

Littore Trinacrio dederatque abeuntibus

heros

Dividit.”
virgil speaks of him as an old man, “ aevi
maturus Acestes ” (v. 73). The ‘cadus’
was 1110 same as the ‘amphora,’ and the
‘amphora’ was equal to two ‘urnae,' or
nearly six gallons (see vi. 426, n.). [Rib-
beck and Jahn have ‘annis,' v. 235, and
‘ Siculi‚’ v. 236.]

237. Est-ique ut mores] Make 11 a point
that he shall mould 1110 boy's morals as
he would a figure of wax 3 that 110 watch
over the whole flock like a father, to keep

them from filthy practices. The master
answers it is not a very easy matter to keep
a watch over so many. But the father is
not supposed to listen to him. ‘ Haec
cures' refers to all that has gone before
from v. 229. The poet has put as ironical
advice to fathers what they do without his
advice 3 and 1110 rcquirements contained in
vv. 229—240 are what the man means when
he says ‘haec euresss as if he had been
reeounting them 1ο him. ‘ Inquit‚' ‘says
he,' means any father who has a boy in the
school. If 1110 master attends 1ο all these
things. then at the end of the year he will
get paid his fee, which amounts to as much
as a prizefighter or such like gets in the
circus or amphitheatro. This the father
tells him with much impudence, as if that
ought to satisfy him. thether it was
usual 1ο pay the teaeher’s see anuually οι·

being paid 1110111111)γ 011 1110 Ides (S. i. 6. 75).
But 1110 practice must have varied in ‹lif-
ferent plaees. Juvenal speaks above (v.
186) of two sestertia as Quintilian's fee;
that would be perhaps for a whole year, or
a course. The sum of five ‘aurei’ was
allowed 1ο be given *to a successful gla-
diator. As to ‘ aureus’ sce above, v. 122,
