Hic putat esse deos et pejerat, atque ita secum :

“ Decernat quodcunque volet de corpore nostro

Isis et irato feriat mea lumina sistro,

Dummodo vel caecus teneam quos abnego nummos.

Et phthisis et vomicae putres et dimidium' crus
Pauper locupletem optare podagram

Sunt tanti.

Epp. ii. 1. 16. and above, iii. 144, n., and
xiv. 219. ¹ Quaecunque ’ is not commonly
used without a verb, like ‘quaevis’ lt is
so above. v. 56. and in the following
places: S. iii. 156, twice in iii. 230, x.
359, xiV. 210. Here it might be taken
with ‘ tangunt,’ whatever altars they
touch, but J uvenal's practice makes it pro-
bable he meant the other construction.

91. esse deos et pejerat‚] ‘ Et ¹ 15 equi-
valent to ‘et tamen,‘ as “probitas lauda-
tur et alget ’' (i. 74). He believes there

much used at Is is' festival. He says Isis
may strike her angry (515110111ὀι111159595
and blind him, still the temptation 15 too
strong ;he had rather 105 9 1115 sight and
keep tlie stolen 11101195 than keep his 95· 95
andp lose the money. The Latin name of
the ‘sistrum’ is ‘crepitaculumss Ovid
(Amor. iii. 9. 34) says, “Quid vos sacra
juvant? quid nunc Aegyptia prosunt Sis·
tra ?” There are representations of ‘sis-
tra' on the obelisks in the British Mu-
scum.

95. Et phthisis et vomicae putres]
‘Consumption and putrid abscesses and a
broken leg' (S. xv. 57, n.).

96. Sunt taust] Ruperti and Heinrich
have a (Ρ) after ‘tanti,’ and Ruperti’s
note is, “Sunt tanti aestimanda ut non
eligantur cum opibus et patienter feran-
tur ?'' He adds immediately the Scholiast's
note, which might have corrected him:
‘⁶ Melius est aegrotare cum divitiis quam
esse sanum pauperein.'' ‘ Tanti ' may be
translated “ are worth bearing-,³³ where we
understand readily that they are worth
bearing for the sake of money. It may
not 119 easy to extract this meaning from
the sentence grammatically‚ but Madvig
(Opusc. ii. 187, sqq.) has shown by abun·
dant examplae that ‘tanti‚' which at first
meant the worth of the thing for which a
price is given, came conventionally to be
joined with the price itself, as here. Among

the examples he gives, two arc from Cicero's
orations against Catilinc. Cicero says he
knows the storm of unpopularity that will
burst upon himself if Catiline is forced to
go into exile by his threats; and adds,
‘⁶ Sed est tanti, dnmmodo ista privata sit
calamitas et a rei publicae periculis sejunga-
tur:'’ “but it is worth bearing if it be
only the calamity of a private person, and
involve the commonwealth in no danger”
(i. 9). In the second oration (c. 7) 119
repeats the same sentiment thus: “Est
1111111 tanti, Quirites, hujus invidiae falsae
atque iniquae tempestatem subire, dum-
modo a vobis hujus horribilis belli ac nefarii
periculum depellatur:’' “it is worth my
while to sustain the storm of this ground-
less and unj ust unpopularity, if the dangerof
this horrible and wieked war can be aver-ted
from you '’ (Long). Here the sentence is
more complete, and we naturally translate
“est mihi tanti '' “it is worth my while”
when the subject is the penalty that is
paid. An instance of the primary use of
‘tanti ’ is found in S. iii. 54: “Tanti tibi
nou sit opaci Omnis arena Tagi—ut somno
careas.” Madvig refers to x. 97: “Sed
quae praeclara et prospera tanti Ut rebus
laetis par sit mensura malorum ?'’ but I
have followed the common reading ‘tan-
tum ' there. Professor Key (L. G. 946, n.)
supposes that ‘tanti‚' ‘quanti‚' and other
words of price, generally considered to 119
genitives, may be old datives; in support
of which he quotes Hor. S. ii. 3. 156:
“ Quanti emptae Ρ Parvo. Quanti ergo?
Octussibus.’'

97. Nec.- dubitet Ladas,] Not even La-
das would hesitate to pray for the rich
man’s gout, unless he is mad. There
were two celebrated Greek runners of this
name, which was proverbial in this line.
Gout, it appearS, has always been the rich
man’s disorder. It is here treated as the
penalty for 111-8011911 riches, but the man
say 5 Ladas if he be poor might well pray
for the gout rather than miss the moneyss
