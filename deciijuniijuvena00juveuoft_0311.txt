Scripturus leges ct regia. verba lanistae.
Multos porro vides quos saepe elusus ad ipsum

Creditoi· introitum solet exspectare macelli,

Et quibus in solo vivendi causa palato est.

Egregius coenat meliusque miserrimus horum,

Et cito casurus jam perlucente ruina.

Interea gustus elementa per onmia quaerunt,

Nunquam animo pretiis obstantibus : interius si 15
Attendas, magis illa juvant quae pluris emuntur.

Ergo haud difficile est perituram arcessere summam

Augustus reperit, ne regis aut dictatoris
nomen assumeret ac tamen appellatione
aliqua caetera imperia praemineret ” (Tac.
Ann. iii. 56). 111 the decreta of the tri-
bunffl ‘prohibere' was synonymous with
‘intercedere’ It occurs in two decreta
given by Aulus Gellius (vii. 19).

8. scriptur-11³- leyes] This is explained
in a note on Horace, S. ii. 7. 59: “Aucto-
ratus eas.'’ The ⁴ lanista' was the trainer‚
who also hired gladiators on his own ac-
count under a bond, the penalties of which
were very severe. They are therefore
called ‘regia verba‚’ the words of a
tymnt: ‘leges’ are his rules. ‘Fertur
scripturus' is, it is reported he means to
write them out, the rules to learn and the
bond to sign. As to ‘lanista’ see S. iii.
158, n.

9. Multos porro vides] These are such
as Horace describes, S. i. 2. 7, sqq. :

“Hunc si perconteris avi cur atque pa-

rentis

Praeclaram ingrata stringat malus in-
gluvie rem,

Omnia conductis coemens obsonia num-
mis,

Sordidus atque animi quod parvi nolit
haberi

Respondetss’

Juvenal esaya, you see many besides, whom
their creditore, not able to catch them
elsewhere, wait for at the entrance of the
market, fellows who live to eat but do not
eat to live, as Socrates said (Gell. xix. 2).
Aa to ‘macellum' see S. v. 95, n. The
place was enclosed, and was named after
the wall, ‘maceria,’ with which it was
surrounded (see Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 62,
Long' s note).

12. Eyreqz‘us coenat meliurque] ‘Cte-
teris’ may be understood. ‘Egregius' is
an unusual comparative form, from
‘egregie.’ [Ribbeck has a note on this

form, Der Echte und der Unechte Juvenal,
87.] He says that those dine best who
are poorest, who are like an old house
just ready to fall and letting in the light
through the cracks of the walls. ‘ Miser '
is used 'ul this sense of poor in viii. 122:
“ Fortibus ct iniseris.''

14. Κ(Ῐιιετίιιε elementa per omnia] ‘Gustus'
were the things eaten at the ‘ promulsis '
to provoke the appetite (Hor. S. i. 3. 6, 11. :
‘¹ ab ovo Usque ad mala’'). Horace gives
a list of them (S. ii. 8. 7, sqq.) ε

acria circum

Rapuia, lactucae, radices, qualia lassum

Pervellunt stomachum, siser, allec, sae-
cula Coa.’'

 

Besides these were eggs and the drink
called ‘mulsum,’ from which the ‘pro-
mulsis' or preliminary course was named.
These persons got provocatives from water,
air, and earth, fish, fowl, and vegetableS,
and the more they eost the more iu their
hearts they relished their dainties‚ a com-
mon weakness with the vain and extrava-
gant. Horace tells his man to go and
take exereise and get an appetite, and
then, says he, “ Sperne cibum vilem,''
despise a cheap meal if you ean (S. ii. 2.
15). Ι am surprised to find from Jahn
that Heinrich somewhere recommends
‘ alimenta ’ for ‘ elementa?

17. Eryo haud dfflcile est] “Well then
(since nothing stops them) it is not difficult
to fetch the money which they are bent
upon throwing away—they may pawn
their dishes and dispose of their mother's
bust, and season a. glutton’s platter with
four hundred sesterces.'’ As to ‘oppo-
nere‚' this was a common meaning of the
word before Cicero and after (see Forcel-
lini). Handsome silver dishes were found
in all houses with any pretension to wealth,
and they commonly had ‘ caelatores‚’ cha-
sers in silver, on the slave establishment
