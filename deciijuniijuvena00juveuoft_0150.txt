D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Laternam: illud enim vestris datur alveolis quod
Canna lilicipsarum prora subvexit acuta,

Propter quod Romae cum Bocchare nemo lavatur,

90

Quod tutos etiam facit a serpentibus Afros.
thllus erit domini, quem misit Corsica vel quem
Tauromenitanae rupes, quando omne peractum est
Et jam defecit nostrum mare, dum gula saevit

Retibus assiduis penitus scrutante macello

95

Proxima, nec patitur Tyrrhenum crescere piscem.
Instruit ergo focum provincia3 sumitur illinc
Quod captator emat Laenas, Aurelia vendat.

88. Lalernam :] So Horace's Natta
robbed the lamps to oil himself when he
bathed or took exercise. “Ungor olivo,
non quo fraudatis innnundus Natta lucer-
nis’' (S. i. 6. 123). ‘Later-na' is derived
from the same root as λαμπτήρ; it is in
some MSS„ according to Forcellini‚ written
‘lanterna’ [and Ribbeck writes ‘lanter-
nam' here] ‘Alveolus’ Forcellini ex-
plains as “vas parvum ad formam parvi
alvei et ad varios usus accommodatum.''

89. Canna Illicipsarum] ‘Canna’ is a
canoe of cane. The plural of Micipsa is
used, as is very common where only one
person is meant. See note on Hor. S. i. ’7.
8. The only Micipsa on record is the son
of Masinissa, and father by adoption of Ju-
gurtha. Numidian or African oil, Juvenal
sayS, was so fetid that the natives had
nothing to sear from snakes, who got out
of their way to avoid the smell, and no
Roman would bathe with them smeared
with their own oil. This practice of oiling
the limbs is often referred to by Horace
(see last note). There were two kings of
Mauritania, father and son, called Bocchus,
the Latin form of the native Bocchor or
Bocchar. The elder was father—in-law and
betrayer of Jugurtha: the younger was
the friend of C. Julius Caesar and Octa-
vianus, and was the last Mauritanian king
before that country became a Roman pro—
vince. The name is here taken for any
African.

91. Quod tutos etiam] This verse is
omitted in the oldest MS. of Pithoeus and
in his edition. It appears in all other
MSS. and editions. Ruperti, Heinrich,
Jahn [and Ribbeck] condemn it as spu—
rious. Most MSS. have ‘at1·is,' a reading
also found in Hor. S. ii. 8. 95: “Canidia
afflasset pejor serpentibus Afris.²' Ruperti
and Jahn have ‘atris,' Heinrich ‘Afros'

There seems an uncertainty about the verse,
which is not worth much.

93. Tauromenitanae rupea] From this
we may infer that the eastern coast ot
Sicily, on which Tauromenium (Taormina)
was situated, abounded in fine barbels as
well as the neighbourhood of Corsica and
other parts of the Mare Etruscum. As to
the costliness of these fish, see S. iv. 15, n.
He says the man had to get his barbels
from a distance, because the neighbouring
coast had been exhausted to satisfy the
ravenous appetite for them.

94. nostrum mare‚] [This term, which
originally had probably a limited sense,
ultimately signified all the Mediterranean.
In this passage the context shows that it
has a very limited sense. See Caesar, Β. G.
v. 1, Sallust, Jug. c. 17.]

95. macello] The ‘macellum' was the
general market—place, situated on the north
side of the Via Sacra. See note on Hor. S.
ii. 3. 229.

97. provincia ;] The western part of
Sicily was occupied by the Romans at the
close of the first Punic war, A.U.c. 513, and
formed their first province. The whole
island fell into the hands of the Romans in
the second war, aster the capture of Syra-
cuse, A.1T.c. 542. Sardinia was taken from
the CartliaginianS‚ and became a province
soon after the first Punic WVar, and Corsica
was afterwards added to it.

98. Quod captator emat] “ Fish for
the fortune-hiuiter to buy, and ln‘s old
lady to sell.” Horace (Epp. i. 1. 77)
speaks of some whose lives are occupied in
hunting for old ladies and gentlemen with
cakes and fruit. Laenas took fish for his
bait. These ‘ captatores,' or will-huuters,
are the subject of Horace's fifth Satira,
Lib. ii. Juvenal calls his ‘captator’
Laenas, which was a cognomen of the
