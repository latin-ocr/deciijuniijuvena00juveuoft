D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Sic ingens rerum numerus jubet atque operum lex.
Quae tamen inde seges? terrae quis fructus apertae ?
Quis dabit historico quantum daret acta legenti?

vals (see vi. 153, 11.) occupying seven days.
For this reason Juvenal says ‘ toto Decem-
bri.’ [Ribbeck has ‘ somnum' 111 place of
‘ vinuin.']

98. Vester porro labor] ‘ Porro ³ means
‘in the next place,’ ‘ to proceed.' He goes
on to speak of historians, and says (‘ per
ironia1n,' as the Scholiast observes) their
labours are of course inore profitable as
they require 111010 time and study. ¹ Pa-
gina‚' froin which our word ‘ page' is
derived, was a sheet of the papyrus as
prepared for writing on ; several laycrs of
the rind of the plant (liber) were pressed
upon one another, and from this the name
is derived: it contains the root ‘pag-³ of
‘pango,' to fasten. One sheet was taeked
on to the end of the other, and so the roll
was made as long as they pleased. Juvenal
says these people's histories, like some in
our own tiine, forgot all bounds and went
on to the thousandth sheet. As to ( surgit’
the commentators quote Ovid, Am. i. 1. 17:
“ Cum bene surrexit versu nova pagina
priniof' He also says in the same elegy
(v. 27)st ‘Sex mihi surgat opus numeris,

meaning of it here, like the springing of
things sown ς not as Mr. Mayor says “the
pile of sheets rises higher and higher.”

‘ Damnosa’ is used as Vibidius uses ‘ dam-
nose' (Hor. S. ii. 8. 3¹20: “Nos nisi damnose
bibimus, moriemur iuulti.” It means
‘costly.’ The eost of the paper alone is
such that they ought to be well paid.
‘Operum lex' is the conditions to which
they are bound by the nature of their
works. These must vary according to
what notions 111011 have of history3 and
the ‘ numerus 10111111 ’ is ‘ ingens’ or other-
wise, according as the writer deals in
history or gossip. Servius on Virgil, Aen.
iv. 98, and the Scholiast on Lucan, i. 334,
quote this verse with a variation, which

Jahn follows from P„ “ Nullo quippe modo
millesima pagina surgit.'' [Ribbeck has
the same] M. has a foolish reading
‘modis’

103. terrae quis fructus apertae ?]
When the soil is thus ploughed and sown,
what fruit does it bear? what does the
man get for his pains? As to ‘ acta ’ see
S. ii. 136, n. Juvenal says people would
not give as much to a writer of history as
to a reader of the news. He does not say
that ‘¹ the ‘ actuarius' who copied out the
‘ acta' read them aloud to amuse the com-
pany at table‚'' as M1·.Mayor supposes;
nor does he or any one else tell 115 that
there were persons who read the papers
for the entertainment of the public. He
says the man would find that more profit-
able than to write a history. People
would rather hear the events of the day
than read the events of former days.
‘ Actuarii ' were reporters and short-hand
writers.

105. Sed genus ignavum] But, say the
world, they are an idle set, who care only
to lie in bed and live in the shade, that is,
in retirement. M. and many MSS. have

‘'tecto for‘ lect0,’ and Ruperti says itis
not bad. ‘Lecto' 15 better. ‘'Tuto is
the reading of some Mss„ corrupted pro-
bably froin‘ tecto? ‘'At, not‘ sed,' 15 the
particle generally used to introduce an
objection.

106. Dio iyitur quid causidicis] ‘Igitur '
means if they say this of the historians
they cannot say it of the lawyers. How
then are they paid for their services
(officia)? As to ‘ causidici ’ 500 S. i. 32, n.
‘ Libelli ' are documents in the case, which
the lawyer takes with him in a great
bundle into court. Nearly all the MSS.
have ‘ praestant? The editors have almost
all taken the right form, which is ( prae—
stent?
