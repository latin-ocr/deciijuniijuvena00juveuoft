A. PERSII FLACCI SATIRA VI.

Sit reliqua, ast illi tremat omento popa venter?

Vende animam lucro, mercare atque excute sollers

Rem duplica.

Omne latus mundi, ne sit praestantior alter
Cappadocas rigida pingues plausisse catasta ;
“ Feci, jam triplex, jam mihi quarto,
J am decies redit in rugam : depunge ubi sistam,

Inventus, Chrysippe, tui finitor acervi.”

thread while the other is to get a paunch
as fat as a popa's. ‘Traina' is pro-
perly ‘the w00f‚’ the threads that cross
the stamen or warp. Here it is the
thread of which the ‘trama' or ‘sub-
temen’ is composed. As to ‘popa‚’ see
note on Jnv. xii. 14, “a grandi cervix
ferienda ministro.’' The ‘popa' had as
his perquisite the parts of the victims that
were not burnt, some of which he gave
probably to his deputy the ‘cultrarius‚’
and they both got fat upon the spoils.
‘ Popa venter,' a ‘popa belly‚' is like “Cor-
vos poetas et poetridas picas '’ (Prol. 13).
‘Omentum' is not elsewhere used for fat
(adeps). See Juv. xiii. 118.

75. Vende animam lucrm] Here he be-
gins a new branch of his subject, which is
left unfinished. He ironically bids a man
sell 1115 life for money, and search every
corner of the world as the Italian ‘mer-
catores’ did, the most adventurous tradcrs
the world lias ever known, penetrating
places where eivilized persons had never
been before, and acting as the pioneers of
Roman conquest. Casaubon takes these
verses for a continuation of what goes
before, and supposes the ‘heres' to be
urging his friend to increase his store by
trade, and the friend to answer ironically
that he had (1009 50. Α5 to ‘exente,' see
i. 49, n. The Romans got many of their
slaves from Cappadocia. (See JuV. vii. 15.)
They were particularly used as hearers.
The poet bids his man become a ‘mang0‚'
slave-dealer, and beat them all at a slave-
auetion in showing off his goods, clapping
his fat 111911 011 the thigh, or arm, or other
sinewy part, 35 they stood on the platform
to be exhibited. Jahn has the reading
of many MSS. ‘pavisse,' for ‘plausisse,’
which has good authority, and was in the
text of the Scholiast‚ [who was also ac-
quainted with the reading ‘plausisse,’
of which he gives a foolish interpreta-
tion.] The other editors, including Ca-
saubon, have ‘plausisse.' It depends on

‘praestantior.’ ‘Catasta' was the regu-
lar word for a platform erected for this
purpose. ‘Rigida’ is only a redundant
epithet. It means ‘fir1n,' not likely to
give way, as temporary erections of that
sort sometimes do. Cicero speaks of slaves
‘de lapide emptos 3' so they must have
used a stone too sometimes for this purpose.

78. Rmn duplica] Juvenal (xiv. 229)
has “per fraudes patrimonia conduplicare.''
What follows is like Horace's advice (Epp.
i. 6. 34) :—-

“Mille talenta rotundentur, totidem altera, ‚

orro et
Teiitia succedant, et quae pars quadrat
acervum.”

‘ Redit’ means his principal comes back to
him increased to that extent. ‘Rugam’
is here put for a money-bag, which if not
full lies in wrinkles. ‘ Depunge’ is ‘ make
a mark where Ι am to stop) ‘ Depinge '
is a variant, but not right. Jahn has it
in 1115 text, but seems to prefer ‘ depunge‚'
as Casaubon does. Heinrich has‘ depunge,'
and compares ἁποκεντεΐν, ‘to prick off?
The allusion 111 the last line is to the argu-
ment called by the Greeks σωρίτης, the
nature of which is explained on Horace,
Epp. ii. 1. 47, “ Dum cadat elusus ratione
ruentis acervi.” The man means that if
1115 friend will tell him where to stop, 119
will have done as much as to find the end
of a ‘ sorites,' which goes on without end,
as avarice does. [Jahn makes the answer
‘⁶ Feci,’' Sto. end with ‘sistam,' where he
places a full stop, and so the last line will
mean, “There is 0119 found, Chrysippus,
who can limit your sorites.''] He treats
the satire as complete, and so do most
editors. I have no doubt Heinrich is
right in treating the satire as a fragment.

who refers to Pliny, H. N. xxxv. 8. 34, a
passage which does not help his inter-
pretation, though it may be true.]
