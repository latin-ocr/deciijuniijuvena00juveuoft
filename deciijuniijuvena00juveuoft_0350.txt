D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid si bis centum perdidit alter

Hoc arcana modo? majorem tertius illa
Summam, quam patulae vix ceperat ang-ulus arcae?

Tam facile et pronum est superos contemnere testes,
Si mortalis idem nemo sciat!

Aspice quanta

Voce neget, quae sit ficti constantia vultus.
Per Solis radios Tarpeiaque fulmina jurat
Et Martis frameam et Cirrhaei spicula vatis,

Per calamos venatricis pharetramque puellae,

80

Perque tuum, pater Aegaei Neptune, tridentem ς
Addit et Herculeos arcus hastamque Minervae,
Quidquid habent telorum armamentaria caeli.

Si vero et pater est, “ Coniedam,” inquit, “ flebile nati

Sinciput elixi Pharioque madentis acet0.''

85

Sunt 111 Fortunae qui casibus omnia ponunt
Et nullo credunt mundum rectore moveri,
Natura volvente vices et 111015 et anni,

Atque ideo intrepidi quaecunque altaria tangunt.

then we have the sum his friend had lost,
between SOI. and 9ol. But suppose Ι
tell you (he adds) that another man has
lost twenty times as much in the same
way, and a third still more, so much that
a big chest could not hold it? He says
the corner of a chest could hardly hold 1t;
that is every corner of the chest was full.
‘ Arcana ' is ‘arcanum depositum‚' a trust
given in private. By ‘tam facile’ we are
to understand that he is pntting not a
hypothetical but a real case. [Ribbeck
has placed vv. 86—90 after v. 74.]

76. Aspice quanta Voce neyet‚] ‘Aspice'
serves to make the object present, and it
is conventionally no contradiction to say,
See how loudly he denies it. The man is
put before 115, and we see him swearing to
his lie without changing colour or ssinching.
In vi. 261 we have “Aspice quo fremitu
monstratos perferat ictus,'' ‘ see with what
eries she deals her tutored blows.’

78. Tarpeiaque fulmina] The bolts of
Jupiter Capitolinus (S. xii. 6, n.). ‘ Fra-
mea’ was a German name for a spear.
Augus'tin (Epp. xvi. 120, quoted by For-
cellini) says it was a sword, and so it may
have been in Africa, in his day, as Forcell.
says, but Tacitus, Germ. 6, says it is a
spear. As to Cirrha 500 vii. Gt, n. Po-
seidon according 10 the Greeks was espe-
cially the god of the Aegean Sea, in which
he had his residence under the waters, off

the coast of Euboea. The bow of Her-
cules is that on the recovery of which for
the destruction of Troy Sophocles’ play
Philoctetes is founded.

83. Quidquid habent] There 15 no need
to supply ‘et‚’ as Heinrich directs; it is a
summary way of dismissing a long cata-
logue of armour—‘ in short all the weapons
in the armoury of heaven.' Heinrich is
right in taking ‘flebile' with ‘sinciput.’
Jahn’s [and Ribbeck's] ‘inquit flebile' is
bad. The man says he will boil his son
and eat his poor head if he is not speak-
ing the truth, first- dipping it in Egyptian
vinegar, which the Scholiast says is strong
vinegar. So Martial (xiii. 122) says,
‘⁴ Amphora Niliaci non sit tibi vilis aceti.''
As to Phario see vi. 83, n.

86. Sunt in Fortunae qui] The MSS.
vary between ‘ pouant’ and ‘ponunt,' ‘cre-
dant ' and ‘ credunt? Ruperti, J ahu, Her-
mann [and Ribbeck] have the subjunctive,
Heinrich the indicative. Ι think he is
right, for Juvenal seems to mean a particu-
lar class of thinkers, the Epicureans (see
xii. 101, 11.). Ηο goes on to show how
nien make up their lninds to this wicked-
11055, some believing there are no gods,
others that there are gods, but their anger
15 not to be compared with the pleasures of
possession, or it will not come, or at least
not yet, and so 011.

89. altaria tangant] See note on Hor.
