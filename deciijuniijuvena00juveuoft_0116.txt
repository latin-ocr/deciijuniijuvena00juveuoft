Cantharus et recubans sub eodem marmore Chiron 3

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

205

Jamque vetus Graecos servabat cista libellos,

Et divina opici rodebant carmina mures.

Nil habuit Codrus z quis enim neg-at? ct tamen illud
Perdidit infelix totum nihil z ultimus autem

Aerumnae cumulus, quod nudum et frusta rogantem

Nemo cibo, nemo hospitio tectoque juvabit.
Si magna Asturici cecidit domus, horrida mater,
Pullati proceres, differt vadimonia praetor ς

board. ‘ Cantharus ' was a common mug or
jug of earthenware (Hor. O. i. 20. 2, n.)‚
not a ‘ can‚' as Gifl'ord 51135, following Holy-
day. Stapylton calls it better ‘ a 1110-0111·οᾶ
pot) Horace gives a similar description of
his own diuing-room (S. i. 6. 116) ι

 

lapis albus

Pocula cum cyatho duo sustinet3 adstat
echinus

Vilis, 011111 patera guttus, Campana supel-
lex.”

The ‘lapis albus ' corresponds to the ‘ aba·
0115,’ which we see (v, 205) was of marble,
and this was the 0350 111 very humble
houses. The figure of Chiron the Centaur,
Achilles’ preceptor, may have been a sup-
port of the ‘abacus.’ The translators have
mistaken the meaning of this verse : “near
it lay A Chiron of the same cheap marble-
clay.” (Gifford.)

“ And to support this noble plate there lay

A bending Chiron cast froin 11011(ῗῄ 01111333

Gifford’s is almost a verbal copy from
Owen : “ beneath 1115 tankard lay, And
Chiron, both of 1110 5111110 marble-clay.''
Herein they were misled by a foolish note
of Lubiuus.

206. Jamque vetus Graecos] ‘ Jamque'
means ‘ moreover.' He had some old Greek
volumes in an old chest‚which the inice were
gnawing; the ‘poemata' being obviously the
same as the ‘libellis though some, from the
other Codrus (i. 2), suppose the man's own
poems are meant. The Opici, as the Greeks
called them, or Osci, as the Romans, were
among the earliest inhabitants of Italy,
from whom appear to have been descended
the Latini and other nations 011 the west
coast of Italy to the southern extreniity of
Campania, the Sabellian races of central
Italy, and the Apulians and others on the
eastern coast. Their name here is taken as
synonymous with ‘ barbari‚³ which would
be natural, as the only trace of that people

to be found in J uvenal’s time was in their
language, as it appeared in the Atellano
plays, which were unintelligible to the
multitude. He uses the same word again
111 1110 same sense below (vi. 455) ι “ Νο0
curanda viris opicae castigat amicae Ver-
ba.” The word is quoted from M. Cato
by Pliny (H. N. xxix. 1), and it appears to
have been revived by the later writers.
Gellius uses it repeatedly. It appears to
have been used sometimes in an obscene
sense, to judgc by Cato’s words.

208. Nil habuit Codrum] He goes on,
‘ Codrus, iu short, had nothing3 for who is
there will (leny this? and yet he lost all
that nothing, poor man !'—-a way of speak-
ing which explains itself. But Gifford is
wrong again t “ ‘ Codrus, in short, had
nothing? This is said by his friend, who
may be supposed to interrupt him in his
impatience at hearing such an elaborate
catalogue of nothing.’'

210. frusta rogantem] Most of the MSS.
have ‘ frustra ;' and Ruperti and Heinrich
have that word apparently by mistake, for
they approve of ‘frusta‚’ and there is no
authority for shortening the final syllable
of ‘frustra’ Valla and Mancinelli quote
from Avidienus : “ Ima vehunt caeli, luxit
dum frustra frequenter ;'' but his authority
is worth nothing. The Scholiast has this
note, “aut sine causa, aut panem peten-
tem 3 '³ he therefore was aware of the read-
ing ‘ frusta? Probus, according to Valla,
5335, “ barbarismus in metro est: non ut
quidam legunt ‘ frusta,' sed ‘frustra ;' '³ in
his time therefore both readings were cur-
rent. Pithoeus, against his own MS„ reads
‘frusta’ Henninius and Grangaeus have
the same, and the latter quotes Martial
(xi. 27) z “ vel duo frusta rogat cybii.''
There 01111 110 110 reasonable doubt which is
the true reading. lt appears that in a large
number of MSS. ‘frustum’ in xi. 142 is
written ⁴ frustrum ς’ and no doubt the
same mistake has led to confusion here.
