D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Simplicitas, cujus non audeo dicere nomen ⁶?
Quid refert dictis ignoscat Mucius an non?

Pone Tigellinum : taeda lucebis in illa

155

Qua stantes ardent qui fixo gutture fumant,

Et latum media sulcum deducis arena

 

Qui dedit ergo tribus patruis aconita vehatur

where hc is to get the ability for such work,
and where the frcedom of speech that his
fore-fathers had, but which at that time
could not be. so much as spoken of, not in
public at least.

154. Quid refert dietis iynoseat M'ucius]
The MSS. vary between ‘ Mucius’ and
‘ Mutius.' The same variation appears in
Persius (i.115)‚where the name occurs again
in conjunction with Lupus, whom Horace
mentions with Metellus as objects of Luci-
lius' satire. The man is supposed to ask,
‘ that does it signify (refert, rem fert)
whether you might attack Mucius with im-
punity, as Lucilius did, or not ? Introduce
Tigellinus, and you will be served as the
Christians were? ‘ Pone' is used in Pers.
i. 70: “nec ponere lucum Artifices 3⁵³ where
the Scholiast says, “ Ponere (licit scribere ;”
and he quotes Horace, A. P. 120 : “ Scriptor
honoratum si forte reponis Achillem.”
There ‘ reponere ’ has reference to the stage.
Here it means, perhaps, ‘put up as 10111
mark,’ 01 it 111111 be‘ put into 10111 10150. ’
He 111011115, if 1011 attack any of the great
man' 5 01th men 1011 11111 5111101· for it. So·
phronius Tigellinus (1111050 name is used
proverbi-allv) was Nero's chief favourite,
and his accomplice 111 1110 1111111111(1 of Rome.
The oligin of the tire 11115 traced to his
house (Tac. Ann. x5. 39). To 111 cit from
himself and his friend the odium of this
crime, Nero, as is well known, charged it
upon the Christians, who were put to death
in great numbers and in the most cruel
fashion. Among other torments they were
hung up on crosses‚ tarred, and set fire
to by way of torches (Tac. l. c. cap. 44).
‘ Taeda ’ here means either a pitched shirt,
called below ‘tunica molesta’ (viii. 235),
or, as Heinrich takes it, the pine ‚wood with
which they were burnt. Juvenal represents
the poor wretches with a stake thrust under
their chin. Two of the oldest MSS„ P.
and the oldest of the Niirnberg, have “pec-‚2
Qre’ for ‘ gutture? which is the reading of
the other MSS. In P. the word is corrected
to ‘gutture ³ by a later hand. Jahn and
Ribbeck adopt ‘ pectore?

157. Et latum media sulcum deducis]
The variety of readings, and still greater va-

riety of conjectures, in respect to ‘ deducis‚'
involve the passage in almost hopeless diffi-
culty. To judge by the M SS.‚ which are
nowhere so various as here, the verse must
always have been hard to understand. Pi-
thoeus says of it; “ nee ullus est in his Sa-
tyris locus, quem ego ex Grammaticorum
Glossis minus grammaticeintelligam. '’ Ges-
ner, quoted by P uperti supposes J 111 enal
to mean that his body 55 ould be dragged
through the arena. I’igalti had said this
long l)efore:‘ ‘ardebis 111 tunica molesta, et-
jam ecce raptaris per mediam arenam ut
pice oblitus et impactus unco flammeris.”
I incline to this interpretation, which Hein-
rich also approves. The present for the
future only represents the action as if now
going on. ‘ Et ' for ‘ aut ³ presents no diffi-
culty. But Heinrich thinks it should be
‘aut,’ which is not in any MS. Another
explanation is that the ‘ sulcus ’ is a stream
or gutter formed by the melted pitch run-
ning off the man's body on the ground. I
do not see how ‘ sulcus ³ can have that
meaning. Madvig’s explanation, adopted
by Mr. Mayor, is to my mind without any
value. He reads ‘ dcdueit‚' and derives a
nominative (quae taeda) from what goes be-
fore, and then supposes the furrow to be
formed in the earth by a number of vic-
tims buried up to their waists iu along row
and set fire to. Some take the meaning to
be ploughing the saud and wasting labour‚
quoting “ tenuique in pulvere sulcos Duci-
mus, et sterili littus versamus aratro '³ (vii.
48, sq.). But this gives a poor meaning
here. Nearly all the MSS. have the third
person, fluctuating between ‘ di ’ and ‘ de ’
and the present and future tenses. P. has
‘ deducis' as a correction ς and Robt. Ste-
phens' oldest M S„ which Ruperti describes
as of high character, has the same. Ste-
phens’ edition has ‘deducit5’ but the joint
edition of his grandson and Rigalti (Paris,
1613) has ‘ deducis ;' and Ι believe that to
be the 11110 reading.

158. Qui dedit ergo] Probus quoted
by the old commentators, says Tigellinus
had 111100 unc-les, and poisoned them all and
forged 55ills by 55 hich he got their money,
55 hich 15 most probably an invention derived
