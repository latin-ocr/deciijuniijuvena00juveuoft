22 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA Π.

INTRODUCTION.

Tnls satire is levelled at those persons in the uppcr ranks of society (and particularly
it would seem at the Emperor Domitian) who, prctcnding a stoical virtue and crying
out against vice and calling up stringent old laws against it, were themselves practising
the worst vices in secret, and giving to the age a character which never had heeu equaHed,
and could never be surpassed, for ‹lchauchery of the filthiest kind. 'she Commentators
have generally supposed the Satire to be aimcd at the professional philosophers of
the (lay. “ The poet in this Satyr inveighs against the Hypocrisie of the Philosophers
and I'riests of his time‚'' is Tate's account of the argument. that his notions of a
Roman priest may have been it is hard to say, hut he writes:

“ When hypocrites read lectures, and a sot,
Because into a Gown and Pulpit got,
Tho' surfeit-gorged and reeking from the Stews,
Nothing but Abstinence for's theme will chuse.”

Heinrich, in a dissertation of much sagacity‚ has shown that J uvenal’s meaning is very
different from this, and the scope of the poem more wide and important. The vices and
hypocrisy of Domitian were imitated by the respectable people‚ and at these he aims his
invectiveS.

From the word ‘ nuper' in v. 29, it has been inferred that the satire was written soon
after the events there referred to, which took place A.D. 83. ‘Nuper' admits a good
deal of latitude, as it often does in Cicero, but it is reasonable to suppose that Juvenal
wrote while the matter was pretty fresh 3 and as the satire clearly has reference to the
time of Domitian, that it was written before his reign was over. Domitian was
assassinated in September, A. D. 96. It is not very likely that he gave it much
publicity while the tyrant was alive.

For indignant power there is none of the poems that excels this· The nature of the
subjects however renders it almost unreadable, and nothing but the honesty of the
writer could make the task of editing it endurable. Whoever would judge of the
difl'erence between the spirit of true indignation and that of a weak or impure mind 111
dealing with such painful subjects, should compare Juvenal with his translator Tate,
who has taken from the satire the best recommendation it has, which is the virtue of
the author. If the psalm-translator and poet-laureate was a man of purity, he has done
himself injustice. The other translators have executed their task better in this respect.

ARGUMENT.

Ι would gladly run to the utmost North when canting hypocritcs dare talk of morals,
mere ignorant fellows, though they fill their shelves with busts. No saith is in their
outside. The whole town is teeming with these solemn villains. What, you reprove
vice, the foulest of all foul pretenders 1 They afl'ect few words, and silence, and
cropped hair; more honest faris Peribomius, who makes no secret of his sin. I leave
him to his destiny ; Ι pity him. But they are worst who with fine words attack such
vices. “ 1 am no worse than you‚” says Varillus the degraded. Let the straight-
limbed laugh at the bandy-legged, the fair at the blackamoor. For who would tolerate
the Gracchi complaining of sedition, nor exclaim if Verres should affect to hate a thief,
Milo a murderer, Clodius an adulterer, Catiline Cethegus, or Sulla’s pupils carp at
his proscription Ρ But such was he who, while his fatal incest was in the doing, and
while his niece was spawning her abortions, restored the bitterest laws against adultery.
