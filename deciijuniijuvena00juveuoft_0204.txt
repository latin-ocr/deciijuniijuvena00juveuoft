D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Praecipuus tamen est horum qui saepius exsul,
Cujus amicitia conducendaque tabella
lNIagnus civis obit et formidatus Othoni.

Inde fides artis, sonuit si dextera ferro

Lacvaquc, si longo castrorum in carcere mansit.
Nemo mathematicus genium indemnatus habebit,
Sed qui paene perit, cui vix in Cyclada mitti
Contigit et parva tandem caruisse Seripho.

Consulit ictericae lento de funere matris,

Ante tamen de te, Tanaquil tua, quando sororem

Efferat et patruos, an sit victurus adulter

Post ipsam, quid enim majus dare numina possunt?
Haec tamen ignorat quid sidus triste minetur

other word. Heinrich therefore cautions
us against supposing it a corruption.

557. Praecipuus tamen] The histo-
rians tell us that Otho was led on to aim at
the empire among other means by a person
of this profession, whom Tacitus (Hist. i.
22) and Plutarch (Galba, c. 23) call
Ptolemaeus, but Suetonius (Otho, 4. 6)
calls Seleucus. With this man he was on
terms of intimacy. He accompanied Otho,
Tacitus 53)·5, into Spain. That he was often
banished is not elsewhere mentioned. His
‘ tabella ’ was an almanac, called below
‘ ephemerides? He and 1115 almanac were
to be had for money. The great citizen is
Galba (see note on S. ii. 104). ‘ Obit ’ is
for ‘ obiit,' as ‘ perit ³ for ‘periit‚' above, v.
295, and below, v. 563 ς viii. 85: “ dignus
morte perit ;'’ and x. 118: “ uterque perit
orator.” See Ovid, Fast. i. 109: ‘⁶ Flamma
petit altum 3³³ and Met. viii. 349: “Longius
it ι auctor teli Pagasaeus J ason.” P. and
000 01· two Paris MSS. omit 558, 9 [and
Ribbeck]

560. Inde fides artis‚] He sayS, the
greater the knave the more he is trusted :
110 man can expect to be believed but those
on whose wrists the chains have rattlcd, and
who have been in prison for some military
offence, or have desei-ved death, and narrowly
cscaped with banishment, and not· back from
transportation. ‘ Genium habebit ’ means
will have one to tell him the future, as
Cassius' Genius told him of Philippi (Plut.
Brut. 36). As to Cyclas and Seriphus‚ see
notes 011 S. i. 73 : “ Aude aliquid brevibus
Gyaris et carcere dignum Si vis esse aliquis 3³³
and x. 17οε “Ut Gyari clausus scopulis

parvaque Seripho.'' [Ribbeck omits v. 561,
which is certainly a feeble addition]

565. Consulit ictericae] It has 110011011-
5011011 before (iii. 42, n.) that the astro-
logers were often consulted about the death
of relations. By Tanaquil he means his
wife. Tanaquil, the wife of Tarquinius
Priscus, Livy says (i. 34), waS, like the
Etruscans in general, skilled in the signs of
the skies. 'l‘herefore her name is taken
here. The woman is impatient for her
mother’s death, but still more for her hus-
band's. ‘ Ieterus ’ is the name of a bird,
one of the many genera of the ‘ sturnidae,’
or starling family. People with the jaun-
dice (regius morbus) were called ‘icterici,’
according to Pliny (H. N. xxx. 11), from
the fanciful notion that the disease is enred
by looking at the ‘ icterus,' which dies in-
stead of the patient: “ Avis icterus voca-
tur a colore, quae si spectetur, sanari id
malum tradunt et avem mori.’'

569. Haec lamen iynorat] He says that
is still not so bad as those women who pro-
fess the art themselves. Of the planets the
astrologers held Saturnus and Mars to be
noxious, Jupiter and Venus to be favour-

able. See Horace, C. ii. 17. 22:

te J ovis impio
Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit volucrisque Fati
Tardavit alas.’'

 

‘ Sidus ³ and ‘ astrum ' both properly signify
3 constellation. Here ‘ sidus ’ is the planet;
‘quo astro’ means 10 what constellation
she appears. ‘ Dentur lucro' is like Ho-
race's “ Quem Fors dierum cunque dabit
