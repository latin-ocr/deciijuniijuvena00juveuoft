“Cretatunique bovem duci ad Capitolia
magna.'’ He attributes it to Lucretius.
Heinrich says lie meant Lucilius. A white
ox was thc most acceptable offer-ing, and it
appears as if the dark parts of the animal,
1115 horus, hoofs, and any spots about him
were whitened with chalk. The horns
were sometimes gilt. Servius quotes these
words of Juvenal on Virg. Aen. ix. 628:
‘⁶ Et statuam ante aras aurata fronte ju-
vencum Candentem.'' It was common for
the public executiouer to drag the bodies
of criminals through the streets. Seneca
(de Tranq. An. 6. 11), speaking of the
vicissitudes of fortune, says of this man
Sejanus, “quo die illum Senatus deduxerat
populus 111 frusta divisit3 in quem quid-
quid congeri poterat dii hominesque con-
tulerant, ex eo nihil superfuit quod carnifex
traheret.’'

67. Quae labra Ι quis illi] People all
rejoice at his death and make remarks 011
1115 diabolical features. And yet while
they hate the man they tremble at the
tyranny by which 116 perished, without
trial or proof of guilt. One asks his neigh-
bour what was the evidence against him.
Another whispers there was none, but a
long wordy letter from Capreae, on which
the inquirer holds his peace. ‘ Index’ is
an accomplice turned informer, and ‘in-
dicium ³ is the evidence of such an one
(Cic. in Q. Caecilium, Divin. c. 11, Long’s
note). Here 1116 MSS. vary between ‘ in-
dicibus ' and ‘ indiciis.' 1 think the latter
is right, though ‘indicibus' has most
authority. ‘Delator’ is a common in-
former. ‘ Cecidit’ is here used as in S. iv,
12: “Si fecisset idem caderet sub judice
inorum.⁷’

71. verbosa et grandis epistola] Dion
says of the letter that it was long and did
not bring connected charges against Seja-
11115, but, beginning upon some other sub-
ject, it then threw out a short charge

Idem populus, si Nurtia Tusco
Favisset, si oppressa foret secura· senectus

against him, 111611 went to something else,
and then came back to Sejanus: at the
61111 it required that he should be put
into prison. Tiberius was afraid, Dion
says, to order his execution plainly, though
116 wished it, lest there should be a dis-
turbance (58. 10). Suetonius (vit. Tib.
65) calls this letter “pudenda miseran-
daque oratio,’' which was the technical
name of 1116 emperors' written messages to
the Senate (Casaubon in loco and Dict.
Ant„ ‘Orationes Principum ⁹). Tiberius
left Rome AJ). 26 and never returned to
the city. In the following year he took
up 1115 residence in the island of Capreae
(Capri) (see below, v. 93, n.)‚ where he lived
six years in almost total retirement, ad-
mitting none but informers and chosen
favourites to 1115 presence, but holding
constant cominunication by letter with the
Senatc.

72. Bene hahet5 nil plus interroga]
This stops the nian's mouth, and he says
it is all right 3 he asks no more questions,
like Agamemnon's soldier in Horace (S. ii.
3. 187, sq.): “‘Ne quis humasse velit
Ajacem, Atrida, vetas cur ?’
‘ Nil ultra quaero plebeius? ’'

73. Tarba Remi 3] The poets used
Rem us' name instead of his brother's, when
it suited their nietre (see Pers. i. 73, nd.
He means “mobilium turba Quiritium‚” as*
Horace calls them (C. i. 1. 7). Τ116 mob
always take the stronger side, he sayS‚ but
that was a 111011 111 imperial Rome. Many
MSS. and old editions have ‘turba tre-
mens? P. and the Scholiast give ‘ Remi.’

74. si Nurlia Tusco Favisset,] Sejanus
was an Etrurian by desc-eut, and born at
Vulsinii. Nurtia was an Etruscan goddess
especially worshipped at Vulsinii (Livy
vii. 3).

75. si oppressa soret secura] ‘⁴ If the
old emperor had been caught asleep'' (care-
less). The way of speaking, ‘senectus
