Non nisi legitime vult nubere.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid placeat dic ε

Ni parere velis pereundum erit ante lucernas :

Si scelus admittas dabitur mora parvula, dum res

Nota Urbi ct populo contingat Principis aures.
Dedecus ille domus sciet ultimus : interea tu
Obsequere imperio 3 sit tanti vita dierum
Paucorum. Quidquid melius leviusque putaris,

Praebenda est gladio pulcra haec et candida cervix.
Nil ergo optabunt homines?

Permittes ipsis expendere numinibus quid
Conveniat nobis rebusque sit utile nostris
Nam pro jucundis aptissima quaeque dabunt di.

Carior est illis homo quam sibi.

Si consilium vis,
Nos animorum 350

Impulsu et caeca magnaque cupidine ducti
Coniugium petimus partumque uxoris ε at illis
Notum qui pueri qualisque futura sit uxor.

Ut tamen et poscas aliquid voveasque sacellis

339. ante lucernas :] Before dark. If
he consented he would get a short delay
till a scandal known to all the town should
reach the ears of the emperor, who was at
Ostia when this monstrous transaction oc·
curred. The courtiers were in much per-
plexity as to how they should act for their
own safety ς and finally the marriage was
reported to Claudius through two of his
concubines. After a good deal of hesitation
Claudius ordered the death of Silius, who
died without fear. Messalina would have
esca-ped if Narcissus had not pretended the
emperor's orders and caused her to be put
to death. When the emperor was informed
she was dead he asked no questions, but
called for his wine and went to dinner. [In
v. 341 Jahn and Ribbeck have ‘aurem.']

343. sit tanti] This is the reading of P.
and other MSS. But ‘sit' is corrected in
P ‘manu secunda ' into ‘ si ’ [which is the
reading of Jahn and Ribbeck] The
common reading is ‘ si.' Heinrich and
Ruperti have ‘ sit‚' in which there is more
force I think. He bids him obey the
woman’s command, and though he may
not like it he had better pay the price for
a few days’ life. See xiii. 96, n.

345. eandida emmim] Decapitation and
strangling were the common way of exe-
cuting criminals, except the lowest and
slaves, who were crucified.

347. Permittes ipsis] Horace uses ‘ per-
mittere ' in the same way (C. i. 9. 9),

“Permitte Divis caetera.'' This advice
is very much that of Socrates, as it is
given in Xenophon (Mem. i. 3. 2), and in
the Dialogue Alcibiades ii. attributed to
Plato. Valerius Maximus has produced
Socrates' opinion in a form which is so
like that of Juvenal that it seems as if the
passage had been before him when he
wrote this satire. “ Socrates, humanae
sapientiae quasi quoddam terrestre oracu-
lum, nihil ultra petendum ab immortalibus
Diis arbitrabatur quam ut bona tribue-
rent, quia ii demum scirent quid unicuique
esset utile ; nos autem plerumque id votis
expetere quod non impetrasse melius foret.
Etenim, densissimis tenebris involuta mor-
talium mens, in quam late patentes errores
caecas precationes tuas spargis ἔ Divitias
appetis quae multis exitio fuerunt3
honores concupiscis qui complures pessum
dederunt ς regna tecum ipse volvis quorum
exitus saepenumero miserabiles cernuntur ;
splendidis conjugiis injicis manuS, at haec
ut aliquando illustrant ita nonnunquam
funditus domos everterunt. Desine igitur
stulte futuris malorum tuorum causis
quasi felicissimis rebus inhiare, teque to·
tum caelestium arbitrio permitte3 quia qui
tribuere bona ex facili solent etiam eligere
aptissima possunt '' (vii. 2. 1. externa).
354. Ut tamen et poscas] “You had
better not ask any thing: but suppose
you must ask something, let it be a healthy
mind and a healthy body, a stout heart,
