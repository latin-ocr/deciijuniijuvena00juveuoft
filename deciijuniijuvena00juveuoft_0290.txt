Et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

105

Excelsae turris tabulata, unde altior esset
Casus et impulsae praeceps immane ruinae.
Quid Crassos, quid Pompeios evertit, et illum
Ad sua qui domitos deduxit flagra Quirites?

Summus nempe locus nulla non arte petitus,

110

lisagnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.

Ad generum Cereris sinc caede et vulnere pauci

Descendunt reges et sicca morte tyranni.
Eloquium ac famam Demosthenis aut Ciceronis

Incipit opt-are et totis Quinquatribus optat,

115

Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse Minervam,
Quem sequitur custos angustae vernula capsae.

107. impulsaepraeceps immane ruinae]
‘Praeceps’ is used absolutely for a pre-
cipitous height often enough (S. i. 149:
“Omne 111 praecipiti vitium stetit'’). There
is no instance of an adjective agreeiug
with it earlier than Juvenal. ‘Ruinae'
is the genitive case (not dative, as Ruperti
says). The English is “he went on build-
ing story after story of an exceeding high
tower, only that his fall might be from a
greater height and the tumbling of the
ruin, beaten by the storin (or struck by
the bolt or lightning), should be great.”
‘Impulsae’ is added to ‘ruinae,’ as if it-
were ‘turris,' and it means the wreck of a
tower beaten by the storm. Forcellini
quotes from Statius (Silv. i. 4. 51), “subiti
praeceps juvenile pericli '³ (where ‘juvenile ’
seems to be equivalent to ‘ immane' here);
and Apuleius (Metam. 4), “per altissimum
praeceps 111 vallem proximam asinum prae-
cipitant.’' Horace has “impulsa cupressus
Euro'' (C. iv. 6. 10), and “celsae graviore
casu Decidunt turres '' (C. ii. 10. 10,
where other examples of this commonplace
are given).

108. Quid Crassos, quid Pompeios] He
here joins together the three persons who
are often improperly called a triumvirate,
M. Licinius Crassus, Cn.Pompeius Magnus,
and C. Julius Caesar. The first was killed in
war with the Parthians, B.c. 53. In B.c. 55
he had been consul with Pompeius, who was
killed while going to land on the coast of
Egypt after the battle of Pharsalia (13.0. 48).
Caesar is described as the man who tamed
the Romans and brought them under his
lash. The plural Crassos and Pompeios
does not iinply more than one of each.
Ruperti includes the sons of each, which
weakens the illustration.

110. Summus nempe Iocus] This is the
subject of ‘evei-tit! “Of course it was
the elevation they had sought by every
art to win, and their ambitious prayers
heard too well by the unkind gods.” ‘ Ge-
nerum Cereris ' is Pluto, the husband of
Proserpina. ‘Reges' and ‘tyranni’ ex-
plain one another. Ruperti says · reges'
are the rich. ‘Sicca morte' is an un-
bloody death.

115. totis Quinquatribus optat‚] He
goes on to illustrate what he said in v. 9
about eloquence. The Quinquatria was a
festival of Minerva, held for six days in
March. Boys had holidays during this
festival and offered their devotions to the
goddess of learning. See note on Horace,
Epp. ii. 2. 197: “ Ae potius puer ut festis
Quinquatribus olim Exiguo gratoque frua-
ris ternpore raptim.” The boy is said to
worship Minerva with an as because it was
customary to present that sum to the
teacher at the Quinquatria. This payment
was called ‘ Minerval.' See note on Hor.
S. i. 6. 75: “Ibant octonis referentes
Idibus aera.''

In 116, P. has ‘parcam,' which Jahn
[and Ribbeck] have adopted. It is an
obvious correction for those who are fond
of correcting, and Ruperti gives Heinsius
credit for ingenuity in discovering it.
There is no ingenuity 111 going wrong,
and Ruperti does not think him right, nor
do 1.

117. eustos anyusz‘ae vernula cap-saa]
A little slave carrying his little box of
books and paper and pens went with tbe
boy to school. He was called ‘ capsarius.’

The ‘capsa' was a round box suited for
holding rolled books (see Diet. Ant.).
