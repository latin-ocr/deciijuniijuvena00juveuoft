D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Vulneribus crudis populus modo vietor et illud
h1011tan11m positis audiret vulgus aratris !

Quid non proclames in corpore judicis ista

Acer et indomitus libertatisque magister,

Cretice, perluees.

Et dabit in plures ε sicut grex totus in agris

Si videas? Quaero an deceant multicia testem P
Dedit hane contagio labem

Unius scabie cadit et porrigine porci,

Uvaque contacta livorem (lucit ab uva.
Foedius hoc aliquid quandoque audebis amictu.

victorious with wounds yet green, those
mountaineers who left their ploughs, would
hear you proposing laws.” He supposes
Creticus to be living in the good old times,
and the rough soldier fresh from the wars
to see him 111 the rostra iu that dress. ‘ Po-
pulus modo victor' and ‘illud montanum
vulgus,' who left their ploughs to go to the
wars, are the same subject. They are

“——rusticorum mascula militum
Proles, Sabellis docta ligonibus
Versare glebas,''

who, according to Horace, belonged to the
age of the Punic Wars. (C. iii. 6. 37, sqq.)
‘ Ferre' properly applies to a ‘lex ;’ that is,
a law brought forward in the ‘coniitia een-
turiata' after being approved by the Senate.
[‘Jura’ is thus defined by Gaius, Inst. i.
ξ 2; “ constant autem jura ex legil)us‚
plebiscitis, senatusconsultis, constitutioni-
bus Principum, edictis eorum qui jus edi-
cendi habent, responsis p1·u(lentium.'']
‘ Ferre leges et jura’ is a loose way ofspeak-
ing, but ‘ leges et jura ³ seems to have be-
come a connnon way of expressing law
in general. See above, v. 43.

75. Quid non proclames] He asks, ‘how
would you not exelaim if you saw those
clothes of yours (ista) ou the person of a
judex Ρ but do transparencies become even
a witness ἴθ’ that is, would not any one so
dressed deserve to be ordered out of court,
or would not his testimony be rendered sus-
picious by such a licentious dress Ρ ‘ And
yet you, stern inipassive Stoic, master of
your frcedom, and led captive by no 111515,
are showing your nakedness l’ ‘ Libertas'
means freedom from the dominion of 1111-
pulse and the passious. According to Ru-
perti it means ‘libertas vivendi ut velis'
(Cic. Parad. v. 1. 4), but that does not suit
the scope of the passage, which is, that he
who professed to be free was the slave of

his own filthy mind. The liberty appears
to be that recommended by Horace in his
Epistle to Numicius (i. 6) : ‘ Nil admirari
prope res cst una Numiei‚’ &c.‚ where see
note. ·

79. sicut yrez· totus] The Scholiast
quotes Virgil: ‘ Nec mala vicini pecoriscon—
tagia laedant,' and Grangaeus Ovid (Rem.
Am. 613): ‘facito contagia vites Haec et
enim pecori saepe nocere solent? The MSS.
and old editions vary between ‘prurigo'
and ‘ porrigo ι’ the first means the itch, and
the second scurf. Turnebus quotes J ustin
(l. xxxvi), who says of the Jews : “ cum sca-
biem et pruriginem paterentur.’' On v. 81
the Scholiast quotes a proverb : ‘ Uva uvam
videndo varia fit3 ³ aud ‘ One plum gets colour
bylooking at another' is saidto be a Persian
phrase to express the propagation of opi-
nions, &c. (Gifford) [Ribbeck has ‘ uvaque
conspecta']. The Greeks said βότρυς πρὸς
βότρυν πεπαίνεται, but from the context
Juvenal seems to mean that one bad grape
spoils another by eontact, which is true.
‘ Livor,' however, is the usual Word for the
healthy eolour of the dark grape. Horace
says :

“——jam tibi lividos
Distinguet Autumnus racemos
Purpureo varius colore,”
C. i. 5. 10, sqq.;

and Propertius speaks of ‘ liventibus uva
racemis ' (iv. 2. 13).

82 Foedius hoc aliquid] He says he
will go on from bad to worse if he takes
to that dress. He will soon ι10111 a profane
set, who it appears from this place amused
themselves with parodying the rites of Bona.
Dea, as performed by women, who wore
long chaplets of vine leaves on their heads,
and jewels on their neck, and offered sacri-
fice and libation to the goddess. Her rites
were only attended by women ; but the per-
