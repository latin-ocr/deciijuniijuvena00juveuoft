we’re 110 match ; they have the best of it who never cease from acting. No woman 111
the house 15 safe from them, resolved to worm their master's secrets out and get him
in their power.

V. 111. “ Speaking of Greeks, let’s pass to the Gymnasia and to a crime of deeper dye.
Thiuk of that Stoie who killed Barea, betrayed his friend and pnpil, the old wreteh
born at Tarsus. There is no room for Romans here, where slaves of Greeee are kings,
who keep their great friends to themselves and thrust 1110 from their (10015 by poisonous
lies peculial· to their tribe ς 50 311 1113 faithful services are gone. It matters nothing
now to lose a client.

V. 126. “What are a poor man's services, when praetors rush before them to do their
homage to rich ehildless ladies? The freeman's 5011 waits on a wealthy slave who
spends 3 tribune’s pay on one night’s lust, while you would hesitate to hire a
common prostitute. Bring up 3, witness honest as N asica, pious as Numa or Me-
tellus-first they must know his income, character comes 1ast; for a man’s credit is as
his fortune may be. A poor man's oath is nought ; men laugh at him, at the rent in
his cloak or shoe, and nothing in the poor man’s lot is harder than this ridicule. ‘ Fie !
quit the equestri-an bench, you're poor : the bawd's son must sit here, the gladiator's,
or trainer's ;’ so Otho 1135 arranged it. What poor man gets a wife, or an inheritance,
or humblest office P All Romans true should long ago have joined to fly their country.
’Tis hard to rise where virtue is kept down by porei-ty, but hal-dest here at Rome, where
food and lodging are so dear.

V. 168. “ Ηο10 15 3 111311 35113111οᾱ to dine off earthenware. Not so when he goes from
Rome to the hills and Sabine fare. In many parts of Italy no one puts 011 the ‘ toga '
till he’s dead. At the country plays you’ll see in the 813553 theatre both great and
small dressed all alike in 111011 white tunics. Here men dress beyond their means and
borrow 11101103; 'tis a common vice, ambitious poverty. Here all things must be
bought. How much will you give to call on Cossus, or for 3 glauce from Veiento? If
a slave’s hair is cut or his heard shaved, cakes are poured in upon him, which he 50115 3
and here’s more stuff to stir your bile 3 we must pay toll, and swell the savings of the
favourite slave.

V. 190. “ And in the country who fears falling houses? Rome is shored up with but-
tresses ; and when he has patched our houses thus, the villicus bids us sleep secure.
I’d rather live where there are no fires or midnight 1011015. The lower room's on {ire—-
your garret smokes and you’re asleep—you get 110 notice till the flames are on you.
Codrus has little for the fire 10 take, but loses all that little, and goes forth to beg a
home and bread, and each man turns him from his door. 1f rich Asturicus' house
is burnt to the ground, the town goes into mourning, business is suspended, all sorts
of costly presents are poured 111 ; and you might swear the man had burnt his house
himself, for he is richer by 1110 fire than ever.

V. 223. “ If you can quit the circus, you may buy at Sora or such places a house for what
a garret's rent is here-aye, and a little garden and a well ; there you may hoe the
ground, and grow a feast for a hundred Pythagoreans. ’Tis something, wheresoe'er
you are, to own the run of a lizard.

V. 232. “ Here sick men die of watehing (and their sickness is 311 from undigested food
and heated stomach), for who can sleep in lodgings? Sleep is dear at Rome: the
rolliug cart and shouting of the drivers in the narrow streets shall keep a sea-calf
waking.

V. 239. ‘⁴ The rich man rides at his ease, while the poor must push his way through
crowds that crush his loins, or break his head, or tread upon his toeS. See there the
crowd returning with their dole ε slaves with the kitchens on their heads : their poor
patched tunics torn ι 1110 long beam nodding on the passing waggon and threatening
death to all ; what if that stone should fall, where would they be Ρ 311 gone like a
