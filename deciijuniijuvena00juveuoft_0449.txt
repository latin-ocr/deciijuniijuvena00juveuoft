Inque manus chartae nodosaque venit arundo.

Et similis regum pueris, pappare minutum

the verse is quoted in several places by
Servius and others. Most of the modern
editors, Passow, Koenig, Orelli, Heinrich,
have the reading of the text, which is that
of a smaller number of MSS. [Jahn has
‘ “ Findor ’'—ut,' δια] Τ110 man is ready to
split with rage, as Horace has it (S. i. 3.
135) :⁶¹1niserque Rumperis et latras? Thc
best asses in Greece, Pliny says (H. N. viii.
43), came from Arcadia. (Juv. vii. 160,
“Nil salit Arcadio juveni.'') The quan-
tity of the first syllable in ‘ rudere' is
short in virgil and Ovid.

10. Joem liber et . . positis] See notes on
Juv. i. 5; vii. 23. The hair was rubbed off
the back of the skin, and it was polished
with pumice and stained, whercfore he calls
it ‘ bicolor? ‘ Chartae ' must mean loose
sheets of papyrus, as ‘ liber' would mean
the same bound up. ‘Nodosa arundo,'
‘fistula‚' are the ‘ calamus,' or reed-pen.
The fellow complains first that his ink is
too thick, and when he has mixed some
water with it, that it is too pale and drops
from the pen. ‘ Sepia,’ the black secretiou
of the cattle-lish, was used, as it appearS‚
by the Romans for writing, though the
Scholiast on this place denies it, and says
‘sepia ’ is used here for ‘ati-amentum?
(See article ‘Atramentum’ in Dict. Ant„
and Becker, Gallus, Eng. Abi-id. 239.)

15. Ο miser, inque dies] The poet jeers

. the young gentleman, and asks him why he

does not go back to the nursery and ask for
a little pap, and get in a passion and refusc
to listen to his nurse’s lullaby. ‘ Pappare ’

Cui verba? quid istas

is to eat pap. ‘lallare' to sing a lullaby,
and these infinitives are used as “ nostrum
illud vivere triste ’' (i. 9), aud others there
noticed. ‘Maxuma' is a child's word for
nurse as well as mother. The poet is
disgustcd with the young man's childish-
ness in getting angry with his paper and
pens, while he ought to be ashamed of
himself.

19. Cui verba ?] ‘VVhom are you trying to
deceive Ρ thy this prevaricating answer ?’
‘ Das’ may be supplied after ‘ verba.' See S.
iv. 45, n. ‘ Succinis ’ is used by Horace,
Epp. i. 17. 48, “ Succinit alter.”
on, You are deceiving yourself; you are
losing- your senses; you will only be de-
spised ; the pot does not ring, the clay has
not been properly baked. He means his
head is soft, and he must be put under the
wheel and made over again. ‘Effluere' is
to run to waste like water. ‘Sonat vi-
tium ’ is the reverse of ‘ solidum crepare '
(v. 25). This use of ‘maligne' in the
sense of ‘pamm ’ (as Forcellini‚ who does
not notice this passage, explains it) is only
found in the later writers. ‘Viridis’ is
used like χλωρὸς (ἀλλ’ ἀμφὶ χλωρὰν
ψάμαθον ἐκβεβλημένος, Ajax 1064). ‘ Nune
nunc ’ means he must not lose a moment.
He must be put under the potter’s wheel,
and whirlcd round quickly without stop-
ping‚ which is only a way of describing
the process of turning. “Argillam atque
