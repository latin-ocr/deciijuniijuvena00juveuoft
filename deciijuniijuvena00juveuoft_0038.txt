xxxii INTRODUCTION.

boen supposed to represent the handsome features attributed to Persius,
but they may be any body, and we must be content with the Gram-
marian’s testimony to his beauty.

Tim publisliers of this edition of Juvenal and Persius, having deter-
mined to reprint the book, asked me to correct the sheets. Though very
busy about other things, I could not refuse to perform this slight service
for the work of my departed friend. It is to me a cause of great regret
that Mr. Macleane did not live to revise this volume. His tastes and
his abilities particularly qualificd him to be an editor of Juvenal and
Persius; and as a first edition of such a book must be imperfect, he
would certainly have improved it, if he had lived long enough. His
knowledge of the world, his strong sense, quick perception, and sound
judgment, applied to a second edition, might have produced a work that
would have satisfied the readers of Juvenal and Persius for some time.
What he has done however is well worth preserving, and Ι believe that
future editors,—and in due time they will appear‚-may find in the Intro-
ductions, Arguments, and Notes, much matter that will help them towards
the meaning of the Satirists. Ι do not think that Mr. Macleane has
often missed the sense of his authors, and he has certainly seized
it sometimes where other editors have not. He possessed one quality in
a striking degree—a bold and independent jndgment, without which an
editor is in danger of being confused and misled by a great variety of
opinions. His notes show the character of his mind. He often ex-
presses his opinion very positively, and sometimes perhaps in away that
may offend3 but he had a sincere respect for good sense and sound
knowledge in others3 he had none of the feeble conceit which often goes
with what is termed learning, and he had some reason to feel confidence
in his own judgment‚ for few men were so quick in detecting an
absurdity or went so straight to the meaning of a thing. The intro-
duction to the thirteenth Satire of Juvenal is an evidence of his large
and liberal views on a subject on which many who belong to his profes -
sion, and even others who do not, have uttered and still utter their
wretched commonplaceS. ³

Ι have not altered the text of this edition, and in only a few
places the punctuation. Ι have added a collation of this text of
Juvenal with that of Jahn, whose useful edition is now generally
