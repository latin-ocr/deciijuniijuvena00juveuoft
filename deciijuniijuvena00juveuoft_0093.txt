SATIRA 111, 43

and tells his reasons sor leaving his native place. No honest nian cun thrive there, he
etym the town is overrun with cunning soreigners and upstarts who have trickcd theni-
selves into riches and influcnce, making themselves necessary to sainilics and getting their
masten? secrets. The poor too have no chance, and poverty apes wenhh3 cvcry thing
has to be bought, and every thing is (leur. There are fires and falling houses, and cvi-n
these are only ruinous to the poor: the rich help one another, while the poor man Starves.
The noises at night are such that no one ean sleep, at least no poor man in the lodging·
honses. Τ1]ε rich man rides safely through the streets, while the poor is elbowcd hythe
crowd, and has a good chance of being killed by great beanis and stones, or by pots froni
the upper stories, and so forth, or hy some drunken brawler who picks a quarrel with him,
or hy robbers who break into his house at night.

There are some parts of the satire which remind the render of Horace's style ς parti-
cularly the quaint description of a poor man’s encounter with a drunken bully, who, after
beating his victim savagely, summons him for an assault.

Umbricius is any body. There was an ‘ haruspex ² of that name, of whom Tacitus relates
that he warned Galba of his fate. But there is no sense in supposing him to be the man.
It was a common name. The satire may have been written about the same time as the
last 3 but it is impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

Though Ι am in despair at the loss of an old friend, 1 cannot but commend Um-
bricius’ resolution to quit the town and go away to the pleasant shores of Cumae.
There is no wilderness Ι would not myself prefer to the dangers and annoyances of
this city.

V. 10. While his family and goods were all being packed into one cart, we stopped in
the valley of Aegeria, whose wood is let to beggarly Jews, and her native fountain
disfigured by art. And thus my friend began :

V. 21. “ No room is here for virtue, no return for honest 1abour; and as I ain getting poorer
every day, 1 mean to take myself to Cumae while 1 have any vigour left. Ι bid my
native place farewell, let rogues live there, and by their dirty trades get rieh3 till
trumpetcrs shall rise to give the shows they once proclaimed, and get monopolies of
every thing, raised high by fortune in her merry moods. What ean I do at Rome ? not
lie, or praise poor books, or tell the stars, or search the insides of frogs. I am no pimp
or thies. So all avoid me as a useless limb. N one but accomplices are patronized,
with horrid secrets burning in their bosoms. The thies loves him who can accuse
him when he pleases. No gold will pay you for the wretched nights it costs you to
be feared of your great friend. ’

V. 58. ‘⁸ The town is overrun with Greeks 3 and worse, Syria has poured her refuse into
Rome—her language, eustoms, harps, and drums, and harlots. Away all ye who love
the turbaned strumpets! Thy hardy sons, Quirinus, put on Greek shoes, and grease
their neeks for the ‘ palaestra? From every town they swarm and creep into rich
houses—clever, abandoned, impudent, prompt, fluent. What should you say that man
was? Any thing you please, all arts and sciences he knows 5 the starveling Greek
will put on wings if you bid him—for Daedalus was a Greek, and born at Athens.

V. 81. “What, must 1 not avoid their purple ? shall that man rank before me who came
to ns with the plums and figs Ρ Have I not breathed from infancy the air of Rome,
and is that nothing Ρ These fiatterers by trade know how to gain belief when they
praise a blockhead's talents, and a plain man's face, long neck, and squeaking voice.
11· 1 should praise them, no one would believe me. Their aeting is quite perfect 3 their
whole tribe are players. Yon laugh, they laugh still louder ; you weep, they weep but
grieve not ς call for a lire, they'll get their cloak 3 say you it’s hot, they sweat. So
