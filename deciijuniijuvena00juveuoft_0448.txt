1. Nempe haec assidue ε] ‘ Of course this
is always the way.5 The clause is better so
than interrogative. The MSS. and editions
vary between ‘haec ' and ‘hoc.' As to
‘ fenestrae ' see J uv. iii. 268, n. Here
Persius says, though the bright morning is
entering the windows and making the chinks
in the closed shutters seem wider with the
admission of light (an effect any body may
observe under the same circumstances),
men go on snoring till the fifth honr, long
enough to sleep off their debauch. Before
⁶ stertimus' ‘ et tamen ' may be supplied to
connect the clauses, as 111 v. 58 below.
[Jahn has a full stop after ‘rimas 3' but
this punctuation destroys the coherence of
the first four lines. Yet some readers may
prefer the full stop at ⁶ rimas‚’ and find
good reasons for it.] ‘ Despumare ' is to
give the wine time to ferment and go off.
Seneca uses this word with reference to
anger. “ Ut minuatur non ut consumatur
calor, nimiusque ille fervor despumet '³ (de
Ira ii. 20). Η6 11565 it repeatedly as a
neuter verb. (See Forcellini.) As to Fa-
lernum, see J uv. xiii. 216.

4. quinta dum linea tangitur umbra]
That is, till the solarium tells that it is
the fifth hour. Sundials were introduced
into Rome according to Pliny (H. N. vii.
60) B-C. 294, eleven (or twelve, for the
text is uncertain) years before the war with
Pyrrhus. The first was erected, he sayS,
by L. Papirius Cursor, by the temple of
Quirinus, which he built when he was
consul. They had been used in Greece

for 200 years before this. The Roman
division of the day into twelve parts, from
sunrise to sunset, must have rendered the
construction of the sundial very compli-
cated, and its indication of the hours isn-
perfect. A century and a half later the
clepsydra was introduced from Greece, a
water-clock acting probably after the man-
ner of our saud-glasscs. But its construc-
tion is not clearly understood. The finger
of the solarium (gnomon) was a thin per-
pendicular piece of iron. The fifth hour
at the summer solstice, near which the
following scene is supposed to happen,
began about half—past nine of our day.
Dials were erected in different parts of the
city, and clepsydrae were used in private
houses. See Juv. x. 216: “Quem dicat
venisse puer, quot nunciet horas.'' The
general name for clocks of all sorts was
⁶ horologium .'

5. En quid agis ?] All the commenta-
tors but Heinrich put the first four lines as
well as the two that follow into the mouth
of the remonstrating friend. vI believe the
first four lines are spoken by the poet,
abusing the practice of young men lying
in bed till near noon. The scene then be-
gins. A young man is snoring, and a
friend comes in and wakcs him. He starts
up and calls for his servant in a rage,
making as much noise as a herd of asses
braying. ‘Vitrea bilis' is probably an
imitation of Horaee’s ‘ splendida bilis ’ (S.
ii. 3. 141, n.). In the next line the greater
number of MSS. have ‘ Findor ut,' and so
