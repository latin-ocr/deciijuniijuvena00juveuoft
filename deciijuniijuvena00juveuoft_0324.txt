(Spectant hoc nuptae juxta recubante marito

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

165

Quod pudeat narrasse aliquem praesentibus ipsis)
Irritamentum Veneris languentis et acres

Divitis urticae.

Major tamen ista voluptas

Alterius sexus: magis ille extenditur, et mox

Auribus atque oculis concepta urina movetur.

170

Non capit has nugas humilis domus : audiat ille
Testarum crepitus cum verbis nudum olido stans
Forniee mancipium quibus abstinet, ille fruatur
Vocibus obscoenis omnique libidinis arte,

Qui Lacedaemonium pytismate lubricat orbem.

Namque ibi fortunae veniam damus; alea turpis,

‘⁶ Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
Matura virgo et fingitur artibus.'’

These women danced with lascivious skill,
and w erc brought up to the trade. Μαι t1al
speaks of‘ ‘de Gadibus improbus inagister”
(i. 42), atrainer of these dancing girls. As
to‘ urticae’ see ii. 128. The two verses
165, 166 are omitted 111 a few MSS„ and 111
others are set down elsewhere in various
places. They disturb the construction
here unless they are made a parenthesis,
which’ 15 awkward5 and though they seem
to be Juvenal s, 1 think it probable they
have got out of their place. Heinrich and
J 11111 ieject them. Hermann retains them
with the punctuation from 165 to 171
awkwardly recast. ‘Alterius sexus ' means
the women. See S. vi. 254: “
tula nostra voluptas?
the 111011 (vi. 341). ‘Extenditur’ means
they are more on the stretch of excite-
m7ent. [Ribbeck has omitted vv. 165—
17]2. Pes-tarum crepitus] These were eas-
tamem, which the Greeks called ὅστρακοι.
See Aristoph. Ran. 1305, ποῦ ’στιν ἡ τοῖς
οο-τρσίκοις αὕτη κροτου ν;οά quoted by Ca-
saubon on Suetonius (Nero, c. 20), who
says the emperor invented various ways of
applause‚ which he called ‘bombi,' ‘im-
brices‚’ and ‘testae’ Why these instru-
ments, which were made of bone or wood,
were called ‘ testae ' or ὄστρακοι 15 uncer-
tain. Casaubon's explanation of the pat-
tering of rain on the tiles is not satisfac-
tory. He says the words of the song to
which the ‘ testae ’ were an acconipaniment
were such as no slave girl standing naked
at the door of the stews would utter. See
vi. 122, and Hor. S. i. 2. 30: “Contra
alius nullam nisi olenti in fornice stantem?

nam quan-
Elsewhere it means

‘Fornix' is properly an arched vault, of
which there were many under the Circus
and in various parts of the city which were
let out for brothels.

175. Qui Lacedaemonium pytismate]
From Taenarus in Laconia was got marble
of a green colour and very valuable. ‘Or-
bem ' is the pavement, which was formed
of small picces, round or oval, of marble.
He says the man who spits out his wine
over his marble floor may like that sort of
language, but plain men, living in their
quiet way, do not. Heinrich quotes Terence
(Heaut. iii 1. 48):“1,›ytisando modo mihi
quid vini absumpsit? See note on Hor.
C.' 11. 14. 26· : “et mero Tinget pavimentum
superb0.’' An engraving of a Mosaic pave-
ment with ‘orbes‚' found at Pompeii, is given
in Dict. Ant„ art. ‘House (Roman).’ See
notes on Hor. S. ii. 4. 83, and Epp. i. 18. 19.
The w alls were also let 111 with pieces of mar
ble, sometimes round, as Seneca (Ep. 86)
says. “Pauper sibi videtur ac sordidus nisi
parietes magnis et pretiosis refulserint orbi-
bus, nisi Alexandrina marmora Numidicis
crustis distincta sunt? Therefore some
include the walls here, and some say he
means the round tables (see above, v.
117). He means the floor, as ‘lubricat'
shows. A man cannot walk on it safely for
the fellow’s spitting.

176. alea turpia] This is severe; we
make allowance for his wealth3 what is
immoral for the poor man may be per-
mitted to the rich ,· it is only cheerfulness
and good breeding in them. ‘ N itidus' has
reference to manners and may be rendered
well-bred. The dice used by the Romans
were of two sorts, ‘tali‚' which had* four
flat sides, and ‘tesserae, tessellac‚' which
had six. The former were made of the
knuekle bones of animals, chiefly sheep,
