D. JUNII JUVENALIS

In qua sollicitas imitatur janua portas.
Scit dare libertos extrema in parte sedentes
Ordinis et magnas comitum disponere voccS.

Nemo dabit regum quanti subsellia constent,

45

Et quae conducto pendent anabathra tigillo,
Quaeque reportandis posita est orchestra cathedris.
Nos tamen hoc agimus, tenuique in pulvere sulcos
Ducimus et litus sterili versamus aratro.

Nam si discedas, laqueo tenet ambitiosi

50

Consuetudo mali 3 tenet insanabile multos
Scribendi cacoethes et aegro in corde senescit.
Sed vatem egregium cui non sit publica vena,
Qui nihil expositum soleat deducere, nec qui

he says, “Not i. q. ‘diu,' which force it
seems not to have except with such words
as ‘ provectus‚' which properly denote ex-
10115103. 11 may mean ‘at a distance.' ''
No doubt it may, but does not so here.

46. pendent anabathra tigilla] The
room is supposed to be arranged like a
theatre with ‘ subsellia,’ which are benches
placed about the room on the floor3 ·’ 3113-
bathra,’ or benches rising one above the
other at the sides of the room3 and 311
orchestra, reserved seats near the speaker.
The orchestra in a Greek theatre was the
circular space in front of the stage occupied
by the chorus. In Roman theatreS, which
nearly resembled the Greek, the orchestra
was given up to the accommodatiori of
senators and magistrates and other persons
of distinction. Here the reciter put chairs
for his more important auditors. ‘ Conducto
anabathra tigillo ’ is equivalent to ‘conducta
anabathra tigillaria,' hired 50315 of plank.
‘ Posita est‚’ the orchestra is set out with
chairs, as stated on Horace, S. i. 4. 73.
The author of the dialogue De Oratore at-
tributed to Tacitus (e. 9) describes the
pains of one Saleius Bassus, mentioned be-
low (v. 80), to get an audience, hiring a
room and benches, distributing handbills,
and so forth, and getting not so much as a
dinner, or any thing but idle elamour for
his trouble.

48. Nos {amen hoc ayimus,] See above,
v. 20. What follows are proverbs for
labour thrown away. So in Ovid (Heroid.
v. 115):

“ Quid facis, Oenone? quid arenae semina
mandas Ρ
Non profecturis littora bubus araS.''

He says again in the Tristia (v. 4. 48), “Non

sinet ille tuos litus arare boves.’' Jahn
edits ‘tenuis ’ (for ‘ 10111105 ') instead of
‘ tenui.5 P. has ⁶ tenui '¹‘ que.' One MS.
makes ‘ tenui ' and ‘ sterili ³ change places3
and many of the old editions have ‘ tenui ’
instead of ‘ sterili ' in 49. But ‘ sterili' is
poetically applied to the plough in this
case.

50. Nam si diseeda8,] He says if the man
tries to get away, he finds himselftied hythe
leg with his ambitious but pestilent itch for
waiting, which,though his heart is sick with
hope deferred and the cravings of a foolish
ambition, grows upon him with his years.
‘ Cacoethes,’ which properly means no more
than a bad habit, was applied medically to
inveterate ulcers and cancers. See Pliny
xxii. 25, and other places quoted by Foreel-
lini. Jahn, judging the next line (51) to
be 311 interpolation, changes ‘ ambitiosi ’
into ‘ambitiosum,'to agree with ‘cacoethes’
[Ribbeck does the same. The objections
to the verse are several. One is that
‘consuetudo mali' is a literal translation
of ‘ cacoethes? But it is not easy to see
what led an interpolator to insert this
verse between 51 and 53.]

53. Sed ratem egregium] These hunters
after a small reputation and the rewards of
authorship, which they never realize, can
never be good poets. Such a one must
have his mind free from care and bitterness,
and be at peace and love it. ‘ Vena' is 3

pigetgphor from mines, as in Horace, C. ii.

“At fides et ingeni
Benigna vena est.”

‘ Publica ' is, like κοινὴ, 11131 which belongs
to 311, commonplace ς ‘expositum ³ means
such as you would meet with in the -high-
