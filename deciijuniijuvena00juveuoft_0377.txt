SATIRA XIV.

327

Ipse quoque esuriens 3 neque enim omnia sustinet unquam
Mueida caerulei panis consumere frusta,
Hesternum solitus medio servare minutal

Septembri, nee non dill‘erre in tempora coenae

130

Alterius conchem aestivam cum parte lacerti
Signatum vel dimidio putrique siluro,
Filaque sectivi numerata includere porri.
Invitatus ad haec aliquis de ponte negabit.

Sed quo divitias haec per tormenta coactas,

135

Quum furor haud dubius, quum sit manifesta phrenesis·‚
Ut locuples moriaris egentis vivere fato?

Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,

Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia erevit5

Casaubon quotes this verse of JuvenaPs.
As to ‘modius ' see above, v. 67; and on
the slaves’ rations see S. vii. 120, “Afrorum
epimenia 3⁵² aud Hor. S. i. 5. 69, n., “cui
satis una Farris libra foret.”

127. neque enim omnia sustinet] ‘Ne-
que’ is ‘not even ' (v. 66). ‘ Sustincrc ' is
osten used 111 this way, as the Greeks used
τλῆναι, and as we say ‘a man cannot bear
to do a thing? ¹ Minutal ' 15 11111188(1 meat
mixed with chopped vegetables and other
things. To keep this from one (lay to
another in the closest month of the year
was a dirty trick. As to ‘ conchem ' ¹ind

‘sectivi poi 11 see S. iii. 293, “Cujus
conche tumes? quis tecum sectile porrumss
&c- ‘Lacertus’ was the name of some
coarse sea fish which they used to salt and
dry. The ‘silurus' has been mentioned
before, iv. 33. This man seals up the
fragments of his miserable supper, at a
time of the year when they cannot fail to
stink next (lay, and counts every leek on his
rope, aud shuts them up in the cupboard too.
Juvenal perhaps had in mind Theophrastus’
description of the miser (ubi sup.,) which
ends thus: τὰ δὲ καταλειπόμενα ἀπὸ τῆς
τραπέζης ἡμίση τῶν ῥαφανίδων ἀπογρά-
φεσθαι, ἵνα οἱ διακονοῦντες παῖδες μὴ
λάβωσιν, ‘ to count half the radishes that
are lest from the table that the servants
may not steal them! Plautus speaks of
‘¹ triparcos, vetulos, avidos aridos, qui Sa-
linum servo obsignant eum sale ’' (Persa ii.

131 com-Item aeslivoem] Jahn and Her-
mann go against their MS. in favour of
the common reading‘ aestivi' [which Rib-
beck also has]. P. has the accusative.
Many MSS. have‘ concham‚’ which' is not
the form Juvenal uses (see last note).

134. aliqui-s· cle ponte] See iv. 116, 11..
“ dirusque a ponte satelles.”

135. Sed quo divilias] As to ‘ quo ' see
viii. 9. 142, 11. Horace says the miser is
more mad than any :

“ Danda est hellebori multo pars maxima
avaris ς
Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet
0111118111.”

(s. ii. 3. 82.)

‘ Phrenesis ’ seems to have been borrowcd
from the Greek after Cicero' s time. It was
a general 181111 for insanity, while‘ furor'
commonly and in legal language meant
madness with 1 10181188.

137. egentis vivere sato ?] ‘Egenti' is
the common reading, and Ruperti says it
is‘ ‘rectius forsan, certe doctiusl’ It seems
how ever he preferred the less learned form,
for, like the other editors, except Achaintre,
he has the genitive, the chief authority for
which 15 P.

138. quum tur-yet sacculus] He begins
111111 a small bag, aud when that is full he
wants more. ‘Saeculus’ occurs above, xi.
27. ‘Crescit’ is the reading of most MSS.
and old editions 5 and Ruperti says “forte
rectius,” but he takes ‘ erevit.’ P. has
‘ crevit.’ Juvenal refers to that which has
grown, for the bag is full. The perfect is
right. Instead ofspeuding his fortune the
man invests it in furms, like those persons
whom Horace speaks of, “ quorum Conspi-
citur nitidis fundata pecunia villis ” (Epp. i.
15.46,11.). The ‘villa ' here meant is a ‘villa
rustica, ’ a farm house, as opposed to ‘ villa
urban-i' a subur-ban house. It is equira—
lent to‘ ffundus a farm and the buildings
on it. See Hor. S. ii.5. 108, u.
