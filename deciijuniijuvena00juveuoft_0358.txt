Unguibus a saeva fertur grue. Si videas hoc

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

170

Gentibus in nostris, risu quatiare : scd illic,
Quanquam eadem assidue spectentur proelia, ridet
Nemo, ubi tota cohors pede non est altior uno.

“ Nullane perjuri capitis fraudisque nefandae

Poena erit ‘?'’

Abreptum crede hunc graviore catena 175

Protinus et nostro (quid plus velit ira ΣΡ) necari
Arbitrio ; manet illa tamen jactura, nec unquam
Depositum tibi sospes erit, sed corpore trunco
Invidiosa dabit minimus solatia sanguis

“At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa.”

180

Nempe hoc indocti, quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut levibus videas flagrantia, causis.
Quantulacunque adeo est occasio, sufficit irae.
Chrysippus non dicet idem nec mite Thaletis

1'71. Gentibus in nosiris,] See viii. 239,
n.

172. Quanquam eadem assidue] ‘Though
they watch the flghts inteutly 110 0116
1111131153 80 Heinrich takes ‘assidua'
Most take it to 11161111 ‘ continually.’ ‘ 'rota
cohors' is the whole army, that is each
soldier in it. ‘ Ubi' is ‘because therc.'

175. Abreptnm crede hunc] This is the
answer. “ Suppose he is carried off to pri·
son with a heavy chain on him and put to
death in any way we may choose (and spite
itself can wish for nothing more), what do
you gain by that P ”

178. sed corpore trunco] “ But all yon'll
get will be the odious consolation of a very
little blood shed from a hcadless corpse.’'
This is the meaning. ‘At ' in the next 11116
15 the common introduction to an objection
or reply. “ But you will allow revenge to
be a blessing pleasanter than life itself.'’

181. ZVempe hoc inclocti‚] After ‘hoc'
‘arbitrantur ’ or ‘ dieunt ' is readily sup-
plied. This ellipse is common, as for in-
stance Cicero (de Am. 6. 4) speaks of
Socrates as one “qui non tum hoc tum
illud, ut in plerisque, scd idem semper,
Animos hominum esse divinos.'' He sayS,
no doubt this is the doctrine of the igno-
rant, for they are ready to blaze up for
little or no cause. By ‘indocti ' the Ro-
man writers commonly meant those who
had not become acquainted with the doc-
trines of the philosophers. Equability of
temper was a fundamental doctrine in the
teaching of nearly all the sehools, and
nothing could be more opposed to that

teaching than the excitemcnt of a passion-
ate vindictiveness. Juvenal writes as a
philosopher and quotes philosophers to
support him. See Introduction, and note
on Hor. Epp. i. 6. 1;

“ Nil admirari prope res est una, Numici,
Solaque quae possit facere et servare bea-
tum.”

183. Quantulacumque adeo] Heinrich
charges this verse on the niouks. I have
already remarked on his over-acuteness ς Ι
think he shows it here again. ‘Adeo’
strengthens ‘quantulacunque'

184. Chrysippus· non dic-et idem] Chry-
sippus succeeded Cleanthes the successor of
Zeno, as the head of the Stoic school.
Juvenal says above 116 had never read the
Stoics’ works, and he probably takes
Chrysippus' name at random. The legends
of Thales were all more or less fabulous‚
and his person being uncertain his cha-
racter is still more so. He is represented
as having been very active in politica} life
and to have directed his people‚ the Mile-
sians, in their wars. As to the form oi
words 566 note on S. iv. 39. Socrates has
been mentioned in this way in S. vii. 206.
There is no warrant for supposing that 1115
accuser, like J udas, wanted to destroy him-
self, and that Socrates refused him a share
of his poison, as the Scholiast says. Ju-
venal says he would not have given him a
share if he had wanted it, as Schurzfleisch
observes. Horace calls him ‘Anyti reum.’
Three persons got up the case against him:
the other two were Meletus and Lycon.
