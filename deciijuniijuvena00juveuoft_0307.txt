SATIRA X.

Exta et candiduli diviua tomacula porci,

Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano:
Fortem posce animum mortis terrore carentem,
Qui spatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat
Naturae, qui ferre queat quoscunque labores,

Nesciat irasci, cupiat nihil, et potiores

Herculis aerumnas credat saevosque labores
Et Venere ct coenis et pluma Sardanapali.
Monstro quod ipsc tibi possis dare: semita certe
Tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vitae.

Nullum numen abest· si sit Prudentia ε nos te,

355

Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam caeloque locamus.

patient and content.'' ‘Et ¹ is used for
emphasis, as the Greeks used καί. ‘ Sacel-
lis’ means the chapel every inan had iu
his house, in which were iuiages of the
Lares, to whom the offering of a pig was
common (Hor. C. iii. 23. 4). ‘Toniacula ’
is minced meat, derived from τέμνω. Jahn
from P. has ‘tumacula,' which is unintelli-
gible. As to ‘fortem’ see note on Hor.
C. S. 57. It means resolution in keeping
the right course, moral courage and con-
sistency: a heart which while it counts
death a boon is able to bear patieutly the
hard task of living. ‘ Pluma ’ means fea-
ther beds or pillows.

358. spatium . . extremum] See v. 275, n.

363. Monstro quod ipse tibipossis dare:]
“What 1 direct you to, you can get for
yourself, soritis certain that the only path
of life in which peace is known lies through
.vi1·tue.'’ Virtue is therefore represented
as a happy laud through which they who
pass in the journey of life are at peace.
Horace has a like expression (Epp. i. 18.
103): “An secretum iter et fallentis semita
vitae.’' In the same Epistle (v. 111, sq.)
hc says,

“ Sed {atita aet orare J ovem quod donat et
au er ς

Det vitam, det opesz aequum mi animum
ipse parabo.”

There is a more trifling spirit in this than
in the language of Juvenal.

365. Nullum numen abest] Most MSS.
have ‘habea' P. has ‘*abest;' others
and many old editions have ‘abest,’ which
Ι think is right. I can make nothing
satisfactory of ‘habes.' Ruperti, Jahn
[and Ribbeck] have ‘habesz' Heinrich
‘abente He proposes ‘adsit' for ‘sit,'
but 1 think it unnecessary. The verses

are repeated in xiv. 315, sq. As to Fortuna
see above, v. 285, n. Some MSS. aud
editions have‘sed te :’ ‘nos te ’ is better.
He says it is only wc, we men who have
made a goddess of Fortune. Prudeuce
(providentia) makes us independent of her,
and the gods are all on the side of the
provident. [The evidence of the MSS.
hardly enables us to decide whether ‘ha-
bes’ or ‘abest' is the true reading, and
opinions may differ. We must therefore
endeavour to get the sense from the con-
text. Iu answer to the question, Shall
men then wish for nothing? the writer
says, we must leave the gods to determine
what is best for uS. But if we will pray
for any thing, we should ask for health
and a sound mind, courage against death,
which we must consider to be a natural
event (an event as much in the course of
nature as our birth, as the Stoics said) ;
and fortitude, and superiority over all
movements of the senses. This, he adds,
is what man can give to himself, and by a
virtuous life alone can he secure tran-
quillity. Then comes the conclusion. If
you possess prudence or foresight, which we
must take to be only another expression
for this disposition of the mind which he
has described, ‘you have (habes) no di-
viuity or god ;' which perhaps may mean,
you want none to help you, you need not
pray to tbem; for he admits that there
are gods. and that they look after us better
than we do after ourselves. Men however,
he sayS, instead of leaving the gods to do
what they think best for them, and exer-
cismg their own prudence, make Fortune a
goddess as the Romans did, aud trust to
her.

If we take the reading ‘ abest: the inter·
prctation· must be what the editor has
