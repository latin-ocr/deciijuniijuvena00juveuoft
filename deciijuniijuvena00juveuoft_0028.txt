OfJuvenal’s personal character it is not so easy to form an estimato
from his writings as it is of Ilorace’s. That his invectives against the
vices of his time are not the merc artistic and decl-amatory compositions
which some writers suppose them to be, but the fruits of an honest
indignation‚ of rare powers of sarcasm, and of a large knowledge of the
world, I think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing with
the foulest vices, but there is no appearance of his being himself a loose
liver in any part of his writings. When Horace is coarse he betrays
something of sympathy with vice, while Juvenal shows only contempt
for it. Although therefore an expurgated edition of Juvenal would
have more gaps than an expurgated edition of Horace, a well-regulated
mind would be less offended with the entire text of Juvenal than with
that of Horace. J uvenal’s morality was of a higher and less technical
sort than Horace’s, and has led some into the notion that he drew it
from the purest source, and was in understanding, if not by profession,
a Christian. This of course is absurd. He knew human nature, and
he knew right from wrong, and was not blinded by sels-indulgence, and
so was able to state the law of conscience in a way to astonish some
Christians, to whom that law is very imperfectly known.

Apart from his morality Juvenal was a great master of words, and
had a large fund of illustration. His pietures drawn from real life, as I
have observed in the course of the notes, are particularly happy: whether
they represent the common room of a tavern, or the deck os a ship, or
the inside of a soldier’s hut or of a camp, or a sehoolroom, or the greedy
crowd at the sportula, or the streets of Rome, or a drunken brawl, these
and a hundred other scenes are so drawn that an artist would have no
difficulty in transferring them to canvaS. But his hand must be vigorous
and his brush free, or he would do no justice to Juvenal.

There is one particular form of lust from which modern wickedness
shrinks, but which was one os the worst evils of Roman society under
the Empire. This vice is exposed in two Satires of great power (ii. ix.).
The wickedness of women was never so unsparingly handled as it is in
the sixth Satire, a composition of extraordinary power and variety. The
general degradation of Roman life and manners is exposed in the first,
third, and fourteenth Satires, and in the last of these the chief cause of
the universal wickedness is laid open in the indifference of parents to
the morals of their young children, and the example which handed down
vice as an inheritance from father to son. The degradation of the
Senate, once the fountain of honour and authority, and the proudest
