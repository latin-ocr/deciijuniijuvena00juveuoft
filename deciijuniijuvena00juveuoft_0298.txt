D. JUNH JUVENALIS

Morborum omne genus, quorum si nomina quaeras,

Promptius expediam quot amaverit Hippia moechos,

220

Quot Themison aegros autumno occiderit uno,
Quot Basilus socios, quot circumscripserit Hirrus
Pupillos, quot longa viros exsorbeat uno

lNIaura die, quot discipulos inclinet Hamillus ς

Percurram citius quot villas possideat nunc

225

Quo tondente gravis juveni mihi barba sonabat.
Ille humero, hic lumbis, hic coxa debilis; ambos
Perdidit ille oculos et luscis invidet 3 huj us
Pallida labra cibum accipiunt digitis alienis.

Ipse ad conspectum coenae diducere rictum

230

Suetus hiat tantum, ceu pullus hirundinis ad quem

Ore volat pleno mater jejuna.

Sed omni

Membrorum damno major dementia, quae nec
Nomina servorum nec vultum agnoscit amici,

Cum quo praeterita coenavit nocte, nec illos
Nam codice saevo

Quos genuit, quos eduxit,

235

Heredes vetat esse suos3 bona tota feruntur

220. Promptius eoepediam] Of the per-
sons that follow, Hippia has appeared be-
fore (vi. 82). Themison is a great medi-
cal name, which is here taken for some
doctor of the day, whose reputation per-
haps was in proportion tohis victims. The
real Themison appears to have been a
man of learning and skill. He lived in
the first century B.c., and founded a mest
dical sect called Methodici. Basilus was
somebody who cheated his partucrs, and
Hirrus a tutor who cheated his wards,
either of them a very heinous offence.
Horace says in praise of the poet, “Non
fraudem socio puerove incogitat ullam Pu-
pillo ” (Epp. ii. 1. 122. See noteon (xiii. 24.
60 2 ‘⁴ consortem socium fallat’'). Ruperti
fiounders as usual about ‘socios,' who he
thinks are provinciass, though they may be
‘publicani :’ and so they may, but they
may be partners in any joint-stock or other
partnership. On the subject of partner-
ship see Long's article in Dict. Ant„ ‘ So-
eietas? ‘Circumscribere' is used in this
way in xiv. 237; and xv. 136. Maura
occurs in vi. 307. She is called ‘lmiga‚’
a tall masculine woman. This obscene
sense of ‘inclinare' is found in ix. 26.
Hamillus is unknown. The lucky barber is
mentioned in i. 25 (see also note on vi. 215).

232. Ore volat pleno mater jejuna]

The description of helplessness and fatuity
throughout this passage is very good. This
little description of the mother-bird bring-
ing food for her young while she is fasting
herself is prettily introduced, and relieves
the picture while it strengthens it. It is
taken from the Iliad (ix. 323) ε

ὡς δ’ ὅρνις ἀπτῆσι νεοσσοῖσι προφέρῃσι
μάστακ’ ἐπεί κε λάβῃσι, κακῶς δ’ ἄρα οῖ
πέλει αὐτῇ.

237. Heredes vetat esse suom] This
expression must not be confounded with
the legal term ‘sui heredes et necessarii?
These were, for example, a man’s son or
daughter, his son's son or daughter,
and others in the descending degree
who were in the man's power at the
time of his death3 but grandsons or
grapddaughters were not ‘sui heredes,’
simply because they were in the grand·
father's power at the time of his death,
but it was necessary that their father in
his own fatlier's lifetime must have ceased
to be a ‘ suus heres ¹ either by death or in
any other way ; for in that case the grand-
sons or granddaughters took their father's
place (Gaius ii. 156). A man who had a
son in his power (a ‘suus heres ’) must
either institute him heres or exheredata
(disinherit) him by name. This old man
