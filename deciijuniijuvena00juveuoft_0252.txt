Credite me vobis folium recitare Sibyllae.

Si tibi sancta cohors comitum, si nemo tribunal

or commonplaccs‚ “quas proprie senten-
tias dicimus quae nihil habent cum ipsa
controversia implicitum, sed satis apte et
alio transferuntur3 tanquam quae de sor-
tuna, (18 crudelitate, de saeculo, de divitiis
dicuntur.” He adds that his friend Latro
“ hoc genus sententiarum supellectilem vo-
cabat,’' by which he meant the garnishing
of a speech, as Cicero says (Orat. c. 24) :
“ Supellex est quodammodo nostra, quae
estin ornamentis alia rerum alia verborum.”
Ruperti gives three meanings for ‘ sen-
tentia,' one right and two wrong, aud pre-
fers one of the wrong, floundering about
(says Heinrich) as usual. But he does not
adopt, as Jahn does, the very bad reading
of P. and three other MSS„ ‘ verum est‚’ as
if ‘ sententia' was something not ¹ veru1n.'

marks 011 vv. 125, 126 ; and on the whole
passage vv. lli—126]

126. folium recitare Sibyllae] The
‘Sibyllini libri’ were writings of a pro-
phetie or oracular character, originally of
great antiquity. The old books were kept
in the Capitol, and destroyed with the
temple by fire nc. 83, during Sulla's iu-
vasion 01” Italy. A collection was after-
wards made from various parts of the
Roman dominicus of writings professing to
be taken from the Sibylline books, and this
new collection was deposited in the same
temple when it was rebuilt. These sacred
books were placed by Augustusin the Pala-
tine temple of Apollo. Of these writings
Varro (quoted by Servius on Aen. vi. 74)
says, “In foliis palmae interdum notis, inter-
dum scribebat sermonibus ;'’ which agrees
with Virgil's description of the Sibyl ‘⁶ quae
rupe sub ima Fata canit foliisque notas et
nomina mandat '³ (iii. 443), and his account
of the leaves flying about the Sibyl’s cave
(vi. 75). 111 consulting the books a leaf
appears to have been taken at random,
which explains the text. (See note 011
Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 26: “ annosa volumina
vatum.'')

127. Si tibi sancta cohors comitum]
Juvenal says, ‘If you have about you an
honest body of officers, and 110 favourites to
pervert the course of justice, if your wife
does 110 wrong, and is not like a harpy

130

going about with you in your progresses
through the province, then you may truce
your descent to whom you will.’ ‘ Cohors ’
and ‘ comites ' were used for the personal
staff of a governor. See note on Horace,
S. i. 7. 23: “laudat Brutum laudatque
cohortem.’' ‘ Tribunal vendit ' means ‘sells
your judgments.’ It 15 like ‘ suffragia ven-
dimus' (x. 78). ‘Acersecomes ’ (with hair
unshorn) is Homer's epithet for Apollo (11.
xx. 39), and here means a favourite boy
kept for bad purposcs.

128. si nullum in conju-qe crimem] In
the time of the republic governors were not
allowed to take their wives abroad with
them: “ Hic est Flaminius qui exiturus in
provinciam uxorem a porta dimisit ’³ (Se-
neca, Controv. 25, init.). Augustus was
very strict about this. Suetonius says of
him (c. 24) : ‘⁵ N e legatorum quidem cui-
quam nisi gravate hibernisque demum
mensibus permisit uxorem intervisere.'’
But he himself took Livia with him on
more than one tour. Afterwards the
practice became common. We know from
the Evangelist St. Matthew that Pilate's
wife was with him at Jerusalem. In the
year A.D. 21 Severus Caecina moved inthe
senate that the old law should be enforced,
saying that whenever governors were
charged with extortion most of the blame
lay with their wives, that the worst of the
provincials attached themselves to the wo-
men, and more to the same effect. His,
opinion was overruled, and the old practice
pronounced barbarous (Tac. Ann. iii. 33,
34). Three years afterwards Messalinus
Cotta proposed a senatus consultum to the
etl'ect that governors should be punished
for any faults of their wives committed in
their provinces (Ann. iv. 20).

129. Nec per conventus] Every pro-
vince was divided into districts, in each of
which there was a town where the governor
going round his province stopped and re-
ceived all Roman citizens of that district
who came for justice or other business.
These meetings were called ‘conventus.'
and so also were the districts. See Long's
notes on Cic. in Verr. ii. 2. 13, “selecti
e conventu ;'' and ii. 5. 11, “conventum
agere solent.’' Celaeno was one of the
