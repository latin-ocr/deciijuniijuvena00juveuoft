D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Si vivunt omncs ⁴? Ergo acrior impetus, ct jam
Saxa inclinatis per humum quaesita lacertis
Incipiunt torquere, domestica seditioni

Tela 3 nec hunc lapidem, quales et Turnus et Ajax,

V el quo Tydides percussit pondere coxam
Aeneae, sed quem valeant emittere dextrae
Illis dissimiles et nostro tempore natae.

Nam genus hoc vivo jam decrescebat Homero 3

Terra malos homines nunc educat atque pusillos :

70

Ergo deus, quicunque aspexit, ridet et odit.

A diverticulo repetatur fabula.

Postquam

Subsidiis aucti pars altera promere ferrum

Audet et infestis pugnam instaurare sagittis3

Terga fuga celeri praestantibus omnibus, instant 75
Qui vicina colunt umbrosae Tentyra palmae.

Labitur hinc quidam nimia formidine cursum
Praecipitans capiturque ε ast illum in plurima sectum
Frusta et particulas, ut multis mortuus unus

Sufficeret, totum corrosis ossibus edit

Victrix turba 3 nec ardenti decoxit aeno

Aut verubus 3 longum usque adeo tardumque putavit
Exspectare socos, contenta cadavere crudo.

Hic gaudere libet quod non violaverit ignem,

must needs be greater and better than the
present. But 111011 and things are much
what they have been and always will be.
He says men of this day are both wicked
and feeble‚ so the gods, or whiehever of
the gods takes the trouble to look at men,
both laugh at them and hate them. ¹ Qui-
cunque aspexit ’ is contemptuous and Epi-
curean. [In v. 64«, Ρω and Ribbeck have
‘ seditione.’]

72. A diverticulo repetatur fabula]
“After this digression we may go back to
our story.'’ He might have expressed this
more shortly by ‘ sed ’ (vv. 38, 51) or
‘ ergo ’ (x. 54). ‘ Pars altera' is the Ten-
tyrites who got a reinforeement and put
the Omhites to flight. The reading ‘ prae-
stantibus omnibus‚ instant ’ is that of nearly
all the MSS. Jahn, Hermann, [and Rib-
beck] have adopted a conjectural reading
‘ praestant instantibus Ombis: which
changes the subject and makes the Oin-
bites the pursuers. But there is no au-
thority for this, and the people were not

called Ombi but Ombitae. It appears

from this place that by Tentyra there was
a grove of palms, no uncommon thing ;
but this grove was perhaps an uncommon
one. ‘Hinc ’ is not ‘owing tothe hasty
flight ' (Mayor), but ‘on this side,’ that is,
the fugitives as the context shows. ‘ Us-
que adeo ' (82) belongs to both adjectives,
‘ so very tedious and slow?

84. Hie gaudere libet] “ Here we may
rejoice that they did not desecrate that fire
which Prometheus stole from heaven and
gave to earth. Ι cougratulate the clement
on its escape, aud Ι dare say you rejoice
too.’' He is addressing his friend. This
element has from the earliest times been
respected as a benefieial agent and as the
symbol of the divine attributes and of the
life of man. The Persians worshipped it,
and their descendants the Parsees do so
still. But Juvenal is only writing sai-casti-
cally. Gifford thinking him serious could
not “see the purport of this apostrophe to
Volusius, for the Romans cared little for
fire and the Egyptians still less. The mys-
teries of Mithra (he adds) were neither
