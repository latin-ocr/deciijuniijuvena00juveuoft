Ι). JUNII JUVENALIS

Dic,passo1·, cui tot montes, tot praedia servas

Appula, tot milvos intra tua pascua lassos?

Te Trifolinus ager fecundis vitibus implet
Suspectumque jugum Cumis et Graurus inanis.
Nam quis plura linit victuro dolia musto?>
Quantum erat exhausti lumbos donare clientis

J ugeribus paucis? meliusne hic rusticus infans,

51.. Die, passer, eui {off montes] ‘ Passer,’
like the Greek στρουθός, is used (here only)
for an impure person. Sparrows were pro-
verbial. Pliny says ofthem, “ Passeri mini-
mum vitae, cui salacitas pai-'⁵ (H. N. x. 36),
and Cicero, speaking of sensual plcasure‚
says, “voluptas quae passeribus nota est
omuibus a nobis intelligi non potest ?'' (De
Fin. ii. 23.) This man, still abusing his
misci-ly master, asks whom he is keeping
his large property sor Ρ so many hills
clotbed with vines, such large farms iu
Apulia, pastures so wide that it would
weary a hawk's wing to fly over them.

F orcellini says that Trifolium was a 11111
in Campania, near Naples. I do not know
his authority. Martial puts this wine
low ε

“ Non sum de primo, fateor, Trifolina
Lyae0‚
Inter vina tamen septima vitis ero''
(xiii. 114),

and Galen (Athen. i. 21, quoted on this
passage of Martial by Farnabius, who says
that Trifolium was near Sinuessa) gives
this wine the same rank. Pliny ranks
it among plebeian wines: “ Campania
nuper excitavit novis nominibus auctorita·
tem, sive cura sive casu3 ad quartum a
Neapoli lapidem Trebellicis, juxta Capuam
Caulinis et 111 suo agro Trebulanis; alio—
qui semper inter plebeia et Trifolinis glori-
ata ’⁹ (H. N. xivfi), where the connnentators
do not agree whether ‘Trifolinis’ is the
name of a place or of a particular kind of
grape, but J ux’enal's words decide that
point. T he range of hills looked up to hy
Cumae is that which lay between the
Phlegraei Campi and the Sinus Cumanus.
Heinrich thinks* the true reading is ‘ sub-
jectum “ 111 the sense of ‘ vicinum,’ quoting
Tacitus (Anu. xv. 9>z “subjecti campi.’'
Ι think Juvenal would have said ‘ vicinum '
if that was his meaning. Mons Gaurus
(Monte Barbare) is about three miles from
Cumae, and bore vines equal to almost any
in Campania. The meaning of ‘inanis ' is

doubtful. It may mean, as Mr. Long has
suggested to me, that hc had got all the
wine of Gaurus and there was none left.
Athenaeus (i. p. ⁴26, quoted by Heinrich)
says the vinc land of Gaurus was καὶ
ὀλίγος καὶ κάλλιστος. Heinrich, there-
fore, explains ¹ inanis' by ‘minus uber, in-
fecundus? The Scholiast says it means
‘nuper exhaustus transacto vindemiarum
tempore,’ or else that the place was empty
of all trees but vines Others take it to
mean that the mountain was hollow, being
an extinct volcano. Ι think the general
character of the mountain is expressed, and
that it was bare except when the vines
were out. The ‘ dolium ' was a large ves-
sel 111 which new wine (mustum) was put
to ferment, and from which, if intended
for keeping, it. was afterwards drawn off
into the ‘ cadns’ or ‘amphora.' This is
sufficiently well known, but Ruperti says
“ dolia, cados: linit, eorum corticem pice
vel cera et gypso oblinit.'’ The ‘ dolium '
had 110 cork 01· bung; it was an open
vessel of clay, the outside of which was
smeared with a coat of pitch. ‘Victuro’
means that the wine was of the best sort
and would be kept long before it was
drunk. The wine Horace drew on the
anniversary of his escape from the fall of a
tree was upwards of forty years old (see
note ou C. iii. 8. 12).

«58. *Yam quis plura It'm't] This is equi-
valent to asking “who has so much or
such good wine as you ?”

60. meliusne hie rusticus infimam]
asks if his master would do well to leave
such and such a farm (which he describes
by its iumates, a boy, his mother, and his
dog, together with the huts on the estate)
as a leg-acy to his friend the priest rather
than to himself who had exhausted his
strength in his service Ρ ‘Cymbala pul-
santis ⁹ snffieiently describes the friend to
be a priest of Cybele, such as Peribomius
(S. ii. 16, n.). This inan was of the same
kind with him who lay drunk with his
drum by his side in S. viii. 176.
