SATIRA VII.

173

Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.

Haud tamen invideas vati, quem pulpita pascunt.

Quis tibi Maecenas? quis nunc erit aut Proculeius

Aut Fabius? quis Cotta iterum? quis Lentulus alter? 95
Tunc par ingenio pretium ς tune utile multis

Pallere et vinum toto nescire Decembri.

(S. iii. 116: “Stoicus occidit Baream, de-
lator amicum '¹).

92. Praefectos Pelopeasacil] He says
plays make praefects and tribunes, as ex-
plained above (see also note on v. 12). ‘ Pe-
lopea ' may be any subject connected with
the house of Pelops (v. 73). ‘ Pulpitinn’ cor-
responded to that part of the stage which
tbe Greeks called λογεῖον, where the actors
spoke. He says the man who gets his bread
by the stage is not to be envied.

94. aut Proculeius Aut Fabius ?] Tht}
first of those was the person whose liberality
to his brethren or relations is mentioned by

Horace (C. ii. 2. 5):

“ Vivet extento Proculeius aevo,
Notus in fratres animi patemi;
Illum aget penna metuente solvi

Fama superstes.”

He was connected by marriage and eon·
temporary with Maecenas, whom he imitated
in his patronage of men of letters (see Intr.
aud note on the above ode).

Τὶιο Fabius here more particularly alluded
to the commentators generally suppose to
be Fabius Maximus, to whom Ovid wrote
several of his letters Ex Ponto (i. 2. 5. 9 ;
ii. 35 iii. 3. 8). Ovid writes to him in
language of the highest admiration, and
professos to have received much kindness
from him. He is generally supposed to be
the person who accompanied Augustus on
his visit to Agrippa, and who report said
lost his life in connexion with that visit
(Tac. Ann. i. 5. Pliny, H. N. vii. 45).
Ovid suspects himself of having been the
innocent cause of his death (Ex Pont. iv. 6.
11, sq.). He is alluded to by Quintilian
(Inst. l. vi. c. 3).

Cotta was a cognomen of the Aurelia
gens, into which was adopted Messallinus,
a son of the celebrated orator Messalla
Corvinus, frequently mentioned by Horace.
Aster his adoption he was called M. Aure·
lius Cotta Maximus as the Scholiast says
(on Persius, S. ii. 72 : “Messallae lippa pro-
{3333'22132' iffifflfflffih⁰fg¹ff¹iffplstless³
{111 the) last of those epistlcs he says (v.

“Te tamen in turba non ausim, Cotta,
silere,
Pieridum l uncn praesidiumque fori.”

In the time ofAugustus he may have borne
this character, or he may have been kind to
Ovid. But astcrwards, in the reign of Tibe-
rius, he is spoken of by Tacitus as “ saevis-
simae :cujusque sententiae auctor '³ (Anu.
vi. 5). The Scholiast above referred to
says he was “multis deditus vitiis;'' and
Pliny, H. N. x. 22, refers to him inciden-
tally as an eater of geese’s webs and cocks'
combs roasted and spiced. He was fond of
good living. Another Cotta is mentioned
above, S. v. 109.

By Lentulus Juvenal is generallv sup-
posed to mean P. Cornelius Lentulus Spin-
ther, who was consul A.U.c. 697, and the
author of Cicero’s recall from banishment
in that year. The first nine in the collec-
tion of Cicero’s letters to his friends are ad·
dressed to Lentulus. He says of him, “ Deum
ac parentem statuo fortunae ac nominis mei
et fratris rerumque nostrarum ’' (Pro P. Sest.
c. 69); which sort of language is used in the
speech sometimes attributed to Cicero, Quum
Senatui, &a c. 4, “ P. Lentulus parensac Deus
nostrae vitae, fortunae, memoriae, nominis.”
If this be the man Juvenal means, he has
gone out of his way. His support of
Cicero was that of a partisan, not of a
patron. He owed all his honours to Caesar,
and when he had got the highest he turned
against him.

97. vinum toto nescire Decembri] Hc
says in those days it was of some use to
study, and give up the enjoyments of the
Saturnalia, which took place in December.
So Horace represents Damasippus scolding
him for not writing, when he had retired
from the bustle of the Saturnalia to his

country house for the purpose with all his
books (S. ii. 3. 4, where see note) ι

“ Quid flet? At ipsis
Saturnalibus huc fugisti. Α Sobrius ergo
Dic aliquid dignum promissis: incipe.'’

 

The whole month of December was sacred
to Saturnus, and it was a month of feast-
ing, the Saturnalia and its attendant festi-
