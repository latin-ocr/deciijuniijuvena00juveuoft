Sic pugnas Cilicis laudabat et ictus

Et pegma ct pucros inde ad velaria raptos.
Non cedit Veiento, sed ut stinaticus oestro
Percussus, Bellona, tuo, divinat ct “Ingens

Omen habes,’' inquit, “ magni clarique triumphi:

125

Regem aliquem capies aut de temone Britanno

Excidet Arviragus ε peregrina est bellua ; cernis

Erectas in terga sudes‘?” Hoc defuit unum

Fabricio patriam ut rhombi memoraret et annos.
“Quidnam igitur censes? conciditur ? ” “Absit abillo 130
Dedecus h0(·,” Montanus ait : “testa alta paretur,

Quae tenui muro spatiosum colligat orbem.

Debetur magnus patinae subitusque Prometheus.
Argillam atque rotam citius properate: sed cx hoc

Tempore jam, Caesar, figuli tua castra sequantur.’'

Vicit digna- viro sententia : noverat ille
Luxuriam imperii veterem noctesque Neronis
J am medias aliamque famem, quum pulmo Falerno

Arderet.

121. Sic puqnas Cilici-s· laudabat] It
33? “iiffliifiilssssssc 8151ῗέἷὲ ‘fi ἓῗὲῗιὲἒέέ
nimbis hic maduere suis,'' alluding to the
crocus water that was sprinkled over the
theatre‚ Cilicia being famous for that
plant. ‘ Pegmass which has its name from
the Greek πηγνύναι, was used for different
things made of wood, but in connexion
with the theatre. ‘ Pegmata ' were great
wooden structuras which formed stages;
and had two or more stories, which let up
and down by machiner-y. Upon these gla-
diatore fought and other exhibitions took
place. The ‘ velaria ' were an awning
drawn over the seats of the amphitheatra
fo keep out the sun and rain. (See Lip-
sius de Amphitheatro, c. 16, sqq.) By
some ingenious contrivance it appears a
boy was suddenly carried up to the awning
from the ‘pegma’ for the amusement of
the spectators5 and this blind flatterer
pretended to admire a thing he could not
see, just as now he admires the fish,
looking to the left where it was not.

123. ut fanaticus oestro] See Horace,
LP. 454, n. 3 and below, vi. 511, sqq.

127. Excidet Arvirayus .·] There is no
British prince of this name on record con-
temporary with Domitian. The man is
talking nonsense, and knows it.

Nulli major fuit usus edendi

129. Fabricio] This was Veiento's name.
Τ118 Fabricia gens was plebeian, but an old
familv.

136. Quidnam igitur censes ?] The
question is put in the usual formula to the
senate. “The present in Latin sometimes
denotes not even the beginning of an act,
but only the purpose, when the mind alone
is employed upon it, or the matter at best
is only in preparation, as ‘ uxorem ducit,'
‘he is going to be married’ ’² (Key’s L. G.
457). On the same principle the present
is used here, and in other interrogative sen-
temes, where the future or some other con-
struction might be expected, as in iii. 296,
‘⁶ in qua te quaero* proseucha?'’-— So
‘ conciditur Ρ’ means ‘ is it for cutting
u ἴθ’

p133. Prometheus] He means a potter.
As to the ‘rota figularis,' see Dict. Ant.
Art. ‘ Fictile! ¹ Castra,’ like ‘ praetorium,'
means the palace.

136. Vicit] This is the usual word. His
proposal was carried.

137. noctesque Neronis] Suetonius says
of Nero (c. 27), ‘⁴ Epulas a medio die ad
mediam noctem protrahebat3 refotus sae-
pius calidis piscinis, ac tempore aestivo
nivatis.'' Like others he was wont it
seems to relieve his stomach by emetics,
aster a large moal, and then begin again,
