ARGUMENT.

In 311 the world there are but few 0311 tell good from its opposite. When are our
fears 01· hopes by reason guided? what wish when gained is not repented of? The
gods too kind, ruin whole houses at their own desire. In peace and war we pray
for what must hurt us: the gift of eloquence or sinewy arms are fatal both alike.

V. 12. But more are choked with money and with care to swell their fathers' ἴοι-1111105.
For this 111 tyrannous times by Nero's hidding Longinus, Seneca, and Lateranus
were shut up 111 their houses τ guards are seldom set to watch a garret. The empty
traveller sings 111 1110 robber's p1·esence; carry 3 silver cup or two and you shall
start at every reed that moves, But wealth is our first prayer3 and yet no poison
lurks 111 0111111011 mugs, ’tis 111 1110 jewelled cup and Setian wine you have to fear it.

V. 28. Did not the sages well then, one who laughed and one who wept whene'er he
went abroad P Any 0311 langh, but where the other got 1115 store of tears we well
may wonder. Democritus could laugh for ever, yet those towns had no abuses like
our own. Suppose he had seen the Praetor going to the Games in his tall chariot
with Jove's tunic on, with folds of purple toga and great erown too big for any
neck, borne by a slave placed at his side that he may know himself a man; an eagle
on his ivory staff, on one side trumpeters, on the other friends and citizens in white,
friends whom his dole makes such. Why even there he laughed at every turn,
showing that men of mind are found even in dullest 01111105. ’ Ηο mocked the cares,
the joys, sometimes the very tears of 111011, bade Fortune hang herself, and pointed
at her.

V. 54. So 311 0111· prnyers are idle or they’re mischievous. Some by the envy which 15
linked with power, some by long rolls of honours are undone 3 their statues fall, tri-
umphal chariots are haeked to pieces. The flames are crackling, see Sejanus burns,
and from that face, second to only one, are pots and pans and kettles made. Rejoice!
Sejanus through the streets is dragged and 311 are happy. ‘⁶ Look at his lips, his face:
I never loved the 111311, but who aceused him, how has the offence been proved?’'
“A wordy long epistle came from Capreae.” ‘⁵ No more, 1 ask no more.’' But what

him Emperor. We've grown indifferent since our votes were sold, and they who once
gave all the honours now mind nothing but their belly and the Games. “ Ι 11031· that

of Sejanus. Would you be bowed to 35 110 11115, and have his power, and be the
guardian of 3 tyrnnt, living on a lonely rock, surrouuded by astrologers Ρ Of course¹
