Pontice, noluerim sic ut nihil ipse futurae
Miserum est aliorum incumbere famae,

Laudis agas.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Antoninus Pius considered himself as no
more than any other citizen.] Gifford's
translation, ‘ a sense of modesty,' is not
exactly the meaning. In J uvenal's instance
it is a combined want of common percep-
tion and common feeling, that is to say,
perception and feeling in common with
others. ‘ Fortuna ³ is here used like
‘ sorte,’ ‘in that condition?

75-sic ut nihil] See above, v. 58. He
says he would not have him valued for the
inei-its of his forefathers, with the under-
standing that he is not bound to do some-
thing himself to secure the praise of poste-
rity.

78. Stratus humi palmes] Ruperti says,
‘⁶ As the roof requires pillars and the vine
requires an elin, so nobility requires per-
sonal merit to support it.” Juvenal does
not say this. What he says is that the
honours of a man's ancestors are a poor sup-
port for his character, which, if it has
nothing better to rest upon, will come to
the ground ; so the pillars and the elm are
nobility, not virtue; and a poor support
it makes for those who, like the roof and
the vine, have nothing else to support them.
Juvenal has ‘ulmosque Falernas’ above (vi.
150) 3 and Horace repeatedly refers to this
practice of training the vine to trees, C. ii.
15. 4,“platanusque caelebs Evincet ulmos,’'
where the vine is implied3 C. iv. 5. 30,
“ Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores‚” where
‘viduas’ is used as here, meaning that the
clm without the vine is as a husband who
has no wife. The same idea is contained
in the other passage, where the bachelor
plane is opposed to the elm ς and in Epod.
ii. 9,

“ Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
Altas maritat populos,’'

where the husband is not the eim but the
oplar.

guardian of a minor’s property, and the
minor was his ‘pupillus' As to the dis-
tinction between ‘ arbiter' aud ‘judex,’ see
Long's note on Cic. pro Roscio Comoedo‚
c. 4, Vol. IL: “Judicium est pecuniae
certae, arbitrium incertae.''
81. Phalaris licet imperet]

‘ Tutor’ was the

The story
of Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum, and his
bull is sufficiently well known. He is one
of the Sicilian tyrants alluded to prover-
bially in S. vi. 486, and the passage of
Horace there referred to. Horace says, like
Juvenal z

“ J ustum et tenacem propositi virum
N 011 vultus instantis tyranni

(e. iii. 3.)

85. Dignus morte perit,] “That man
deservcs death, and is dead already.’' The
subject is implied in what goes before, thc
man who prefers his life to his honour, and
for life’s sake throws away that for which
he lives (the maintaining of his honour).
‘ Pudor ' in this sense is not found earlier
than Juvenal. Pliny (Epp. ii. 4) has “ fa-
mam defuncti pudoremque suscipere,'' and
(v. 1) ‘⁶ aderat alius qui defunctae pudorem
lucretur.'' Forcellini also refers to various
passages in the law writers. ‘ Perit ' is the
perfect tense. See note on vi. 559 : “ mag·-
nus civis obit.'’ ²

86. Gaurana et Cosmi] Mons Gaurus
(Monte Barbaro) was close to the Lacus
Lucrinus (“ Lucrinas qua vergit Gaurus in
undas,” Sidon. Apoll. Carm. v. 345), which
was famous for its oyster beds. See note
on Hor. S. ii. 4. 32 : “ Murice Baiano me-
lior Lucrina peloris, Ostrea Circeiis.” Cos-
mus is the name of a pe-rfumer often
