SATIRA X.

Ridebat quoties de limine moverat unum

I'rotuleratque pedem, llcbat contrarius alter ’ἓ 30
Sed facilis cuivis rigidi censura cachinni3

Mirandum est unde ille oculis suffecerit humor.

Perpetuo risu pulmonem agitare solebat

Democritus, quanquam non essent urbibus illis

Praetexta ct trabeae, fasces, lectica, tribunal.

Anct. Philosophy, vol. i. c. 6, Eng. Τπ-3115.
See Diog. Laert.ix.c. l 311117). 111 Seneca (de
lra.ii. 10) 15 the following passage: ‘¹ 118-
raclcitus quoties prodierat et tantum circa
se male viventium immo male pereuntium
viderat flebat, miserabatur omnium qui
sibi laeti felicesque. occurrebant, miti animo
sed nimis imbecillo: et ipsc inter deplo-
randos erat. Democritum contra aiunt nun-
quam sine risu in publico fuisse; adeo nihil
illi videbatur serium corum quae serio gere-
bantur.‘' [Ribbeck also compares a simi-
lar passage from Seneca, De 'l'ranquillitate
Animi c. 15; which he thinks that the
writer of this Satin», whom he does
not suppose to be Juvenal, may have
read.] This was the popular tradition
about these philosophers. T he grounds
of it may be traced in their respec-
tive characters and tenets, as they are
given by Ritter. ln v. 30 the reading of
most of the MSS. is ‘alter ς’ Ρ. has ‘ auc-
tor,’ which would correspond to Horace's
description of Pythagoras¹ “non sordidus
auctor Naturae verique '' (C. i. 28. 14).
1 think ‘alter' is wanted here, to corre-
spond with the other. [Jahn and Ribbeck
have ⁸ auctor.']

31. Sedsacilis cuivis rigidi] He says
any one can laugh ; the only wonder is
where the weeper got all 1115 tears. ‘ Rigidi
cachinni ’ is a hard sardonic laugh.

35. Praetexta et trabeae‚] As to these,
which were the togas worn by senators
and magistrabeS, see S. viii. 259, n. He
says in those cities in which Democritus
spent his time and 1115 wit (Democritus was
a great traveller‚ see note on Hor. Epp. i.
12. 12) there were none of the great abuses
of the present time, the iniquities and self-
indulgence of the great and rich, and the
corruption of justice. Horace says 118 would
have laughed if he had seen the abusos of
the theatre and the neglect of the legitimate
dmma, as we call it (Epp. ii. 1. 194).

36. Praetorem curribus altis] See S.
viii. 194, n.‚ and xi. 194. He is giving a
mock description of the Ludi Circenses,

which the praetor presidcd over. These
were preceded by a grand proces-sion, in
which the praetor rode iu a triumpha] cha-
riot with all the insignia of a triumph.
that follows is a description of a triumph.
¹ Tunica Jovis ’ was a tunic worn only on
triumphal occasions. It was kept in the
Capitol, and therefore was called ‘tunica
Jovis.’ It was also called ‘tunica pahnata,'
either because it was embroidered with
palm branc-hes, or because, as Festus says,
it had a stripe (clavus) a palm in breadth.
⁸ Sarrana' is Tyrian, that is ‘purple.' ‘Pic-
tae ' is ‘embroide1·ed.' ‘Aulaea ’ (properly
used for curtains or hanging tapestry) is a
satirical way ofdescribing the large folds of
the triumphal toga. Besides a crown of
laurel which 118 wore ou his head, a crown
of gold set with jewels was carried in the
char-iot by a public slave. (‘ Servi publici'
were slaves belonging to the state and em-
ployed for public ραι-110585, of which at-
tendance upon magistrates on official occa-
sions uas one. See Lips. Elect. i. 22.)
Juvenal says the slave rode in the same
chariot with the consul, of course (quippe)
to lower his pride. thether founded on
these ironical words or some vulgar error,
Tertullian states that the slave's business
was to whisper certain words in the ear of
the great man reminding him that he was
a mortal (Apol. 33), which story has since
been osten repeated. Consulis substituted
for praetor (v. 41), as more suited to a tri-
nmph. Consuls were called praetores in the
earliest times of the republic. The person
who triumphed carried an ivory seeptre in
his lest hand with an eagle at the top of it,
and a branch of laurel in his right. ‘ Da
nunc et’ means ‘ add to this? A band of
trumpeters (cornicines) formed part of the =
111-08855103, and the inau's sous and priu-
cipal friends, together with senators and
other magistrates and military officers. By
‘niveos’ he means that their togas were
white. On all festivals those who wished
to make a respectable appearance sent their
togas to the ‘fullo’ to have an extra 111111811-
