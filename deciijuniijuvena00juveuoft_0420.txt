A. PERSII FLACCI

Memini, ut repente sie poeta prodirem ς

south withhigh cliffs, called by the ancients spring (or perhaps inore than one) at
Φαιδριάδες, 11111161 which lay the town os Corinth, at which, according to the legend,

Delphi. These rocks, iu one place, about
the eentre, are divided, and on each side
of the chasm rises a high peak. Between
the two flows the stream Castalia, ccle-
brated for its connexion with Apollo. From
these two hills Parnassus came to be spoken
of as having two tops, as in Soph. Antig.

σὲ δ’ ὑπὲρ διλόφου πέτρας
στέροψ ὄπωπε λιγνύς.

Herodotus (viii. 32, 39) speaks of two 511111-
111115 of Parnassus, which he calls Tithorea
{ilai} Hyampeia; and Ovid (Met. i. 316)

“Mons ibi verticibus petit arduus astra
duobus

Nomine Parnassus, superatque cacumine
nubes.'’

In ‘somniasse' he refers to the dream of
Ennius, noticed on vi. 10.

3. ut repente ,ςέο poeta prodirem;] ‘ Sic ’
has a force of its own, which is not easily
expressed in English. Horace (C. 11. 11.

14) has ε

“ Cur non sub alta vel platano vel hae
Pinu jacentes 516 temere et 10511,”

where Ι have quoted a place from Terence
(Phorm. i. 2. 94). Virgil (Aen. iii. 668)
11115 “recepto Supplice sic merito.” The
Greeks used οὕτω 111 the same way ; and
the Scholiast on Soph. Aj. 1179, says it is
ἀντὶ τοῦ ὡς ἔτυχε. ‘Just as I was,' is
perhaps the best rendering here 1 “ that Ι
should turn out a poet all of a sudden, just
as I was ;'' that is, an illiterate person, as
Casauhon sayS.

4. Heliconidasquepallidamque Pirenen]
The best MSS. are said to have ‘ Heliconi-
adas? Passow aud Heinrich prefer ‘ Heli-
conidas‚’ which is found in some MSS. As
Jahn observes, both forms are good. The
associatiou of the Muses with Helicon and
Parnassus Miiller (Hist. Gr. Lit. p. 27) at-
tributes to the Pierians, to whom he assigns
the invention of Greek poet-ry, and who, he
say& originally inhabitcd those parts, and
afterwards, migrating northwards, gave the
Muses their other habitations on Olympus
and in Thrace. Pirene was the name of a

Bellerophon caught PegasuS. Through
Pegasus, who was associated with the
Muses, Pirene came to be so ‘⁶003 and
Persius gives it the cpithet which the ima-
gination commonly connects with poets and
other men of study. Casaubon notices that
the Greek poets (1111 not give this dis-
tinction to Pirene, and that the Romans
perhaps (11(1 so from iguorance. Very pro-
bably.

5. quorum imayines lambunt] See note
on Juv. S. vii. 29, “Ut dignus venias
hederis et imagine macra‚'’ and Ovid,
Trist. i. 7. l:

“ Si quis hahes nostris similes in imagine
vultus,

Deme meis hederas Bacchica serta
comis.”

‘ Sequaces' is an epithet used for parasitical
plants, as we eall them ‘creepers.' It ap-
plies 'm 1116 same way to fire (virgil, Aen.
viii. 432, “ flammis sequacibus ’') and to
smoke (Georg. iv. 230, “ fumosque manu
praetende sequaces”). Jahn explains it
“ quo quis ducat sequi promptae ;” but ivy
15 1101 trained: it is left to find its own
support. ‘ Sequi ⁵ is not necessarily to
follow a lead.

6. ipse semipagana-3] ‘ PaganuS,’ as
stated on J uv. xvi. 33, is used for a civilian
as opposed to a soldier. ‘ Semipaganus ’
Casaubon takes to mean but half a soldier,
that is but half a poet, quoting inillustration
Pliny, Epp. vii. 25, “sunt enim ut in castris
516 61111111 111 1116115 11051115 plures cultu paga-
no, quos cinctos et armatos et quidem ar-
dentissimo ingenio diligentius scrutatus iu-
venies.” Forcellini also compares the two
places (Paganus). Jahn gives another in-
terpretation. ‘ Pagani ' 116 says are those of
the same ‘pagus,’ and those of the same
‘ pagus ' had the same sacred rites. ΤΙ-116
poets are ‘ pagani,' but Persius only aspires
to be half a poet, and so he is only half a
‘ paganus? I do not believe this is Persius’
meaning, nor need we think much about
the soldiers. ‘ Semipaganus' is half a clown,
not above half educated and polished.
“ Pagani dicuntur rustici qui non noverunt
urbem '' (Schol.). that follows 15 only a v
wa yof saying that he brings his contribution
