Mollior ardenti sese indulsisse tribuno.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

165

Aspice quid faciant commercia: venerat obses ;
Hic fiunt homines: nam si mora long-ior Urbem
Indulsit, pueris non unquam deerit amator:
Mittantur braccae, cultelli, frena, flagellum.

Sic praetextatos referunt Artaxata mores.

not otherwise known. Ruperti supposes he
may have been one of those ‘ obsides ’ with
whom Caligula. is said by Suetonius (c. 36)
to have carried on an unnatural intercourse,
and that he is meant by ‘tribuno.' (See
xi. 7.) It may be so. Armenia was at this
time governed hy its own kings of the race
of the Arsacidae, but the Romans had fre-
quently to interfere in its affairs, and its
kings were under their protection. On two
occasions Tacitus mentions hostages being
given to the Romans by Vologeses, king of
the Parthians, who claimed the crown of
Armenia and expelled Rhadamistus, the
king whom the Romans recognized. Cn.
Domitius Corbulo was sent against him by
Nero (ΑΛ). 54), and he retired‚ and sent
some of the noblest of his family as hosta-
ges to Rome (Ann. xiii. 9). These were
not Armenians, but Parthians3 but the
difference might not be observed by J uve-
nal, or hostages may have been sent by
others. Every new reign began in violence
of some sort. This man, more soft than
any of the Roman youth, is said to have
given himself up to the passion of the tri-
bunus. This is a regular construction with
‘ indulgere ς’ it is repeated immediately be-
low. ‘ Ephebus’ is a term borrowed from
the Greeks, with whom it signified a youth
of eighteen to twenty. The Romans ap-
plied it to those who had attained the age
of puberty: ‘adolescentes’ is the proper

Roman word, though that extends over a
longer space of time.

167. Hicfiunt hominem] ‘ It is here that
men are fashioned? Some take the pas-
sage as if these words were opposed to
‘venerat obses,' ‘he had come a hostage,
but here they become men? For this
meaning ‘viri' would be used. The stop
should be at ‘obses' (for which one MS.
only has ⁴ hospes ').

169. Imitentur Μαι-ραις] ‘They will
soon throw aside their trousers, their hunt-
ing knives, their reins, their whips, that is,
all the manly sports of their boyhood, and
carry home immodest manners learnt at
Rome! ‘Artaxata,' which is plural here,
was the capital of Armenia, situated on the
Araxes (Aras). ‘ Praetextatus' is applied,
by later writers, to language, in the sense
of ‘impure’ (See Forcellini.) It is no-
where else used in that sense with ‘ mores,'
or any thing but language. The origin of
this meaning is plainly contained in the
word itself, which is only another form of
‘praetexere‚' and means to put a veil or
covering over any thing. ‘ Braccae ' (breech-
es) were worn by all the barbariam, that is,
all but the Greeks and Romans, who in
their better days despised them. They were
looser than we wear them now, but not so
loose among the European nations as in the
East. During the empire they were par-
tially worn by the Romans.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms satire is perhaps better known than any of the others. English readers are
familiar with J ohnson’s imitation of it who are not so familiar with the original, which
has the advantage of having been written for the scene it describes, while the other is
too close a copy to be always applicable to its subject. Ι think the merits of J ohnson’s

poem have been exaggerated.

Meaning to describe the vexations and inconveniences of a town life, Juvenal supposes
his friend Umbricius leaving Rome in disgust to retire to Cumae 3 he accompanies him a
little way ont of the town ,· aud while the carriage is being packed Umbricius breaks out
