SATIRA V.

INTRODUCTION.

Tnls satire professes to be addressed to one Trebius, the representative of a class of
men, who being poor and exquisita-ly servile, were willing to part with their indepen-
dence and put up with all sorts of contemptuous treatment sor the sake of a diuner at
the tables of the rich. A specimen of such a dinner is given, at which Virro the host
reserves for himself and his rich friends the hest of every thing, meat and fruit and
wine, and the parasitos are sulkily served with the worst, by slaves too fine to make up
to the gnests for the master's neglecti Juvenal's conclusion is, that they who will put
up with such treatment deserve it; and the rich man is not much to blame if he
daepises those who are only drawn to his table by the nose, that is, by the savour of
his kitchen. ,

The satire has its moral for modern society, in which, if the ‘relation of host and
guest is prevented by good breeding from taking the form here represented, eating· and
servility are scarcely less prominent features than they were at Rome in its worst
days. If the rich look down upon the poor, it is usually because of the homage rank
and riches meet with; and that this homage comes of seltishness none know better
than those who receive it. The coveting of what is called good society is the vice of a
rotten system; and the man who seeks company which does not want him has no
reason to eomplain if his pridcis galled and his expectations are disappointed. If there
were no Trebiuscs in the world there would be no Vim-os: so Juvenal thought; and ho
does well to lay the chief weight of his satire upon the parasite.

The parasite, or diner-out, of later times had no resemblance to the client of the
republic. He was no more than one of many in the train ofa rich man, or of as many
rich men as he could get attached to in that mean capacity. The old relation of
‘patronus' and ‘ eliens,' so far as we can understand it, was simple and natural. The
other was the mere refuge of poverty, preferring the bread of idleness and a false
tongue to a life of honest labonr and the rewards of an independent mind. The
student will only be misled if, following some of the commentators, he looks upon the
latter condition as only another phase of the former. The old institution died out with
the republic it belonged to; the modern practice was the fruit of human corruption,
and has its analogies in all ages of society, such as is called eivilizcd.

ARGUMENT.

If you are not yet ashamed of the lise you have choscn. living at other men‘s
chargeS, and submitting to any thing for a dinner, I would not believe you on your
oath. The stomach wants but little ς but suppose you have not that little, why can't
you beg? That were more honest.

V. 12—75. In the first place, when you have had your dinner you have got your full
rewarth fer though it comes but seldom, the great man puts it down to your account
you may be sure. Once in two months he has a vacant place at his table, and bethinks

y him of his client. “Come and dine,” says he-the h<ight of your ambition! the
