Pompeius tenui jugulos aperire susurro ;

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

110

Et qui vulturibus servabat viscera Dacis

Fuscus, marmorea meditatus proclia villa ;

Et cum mortifero prudens Veiento Catullo,

Qui nunquam visae flagrabat amore puellae,

Grande et conspicuum nostro quoque tempore monstrum, 1 15
Caecus adulator, dirusque a ponte satelles,

Dignus Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes,

Blandaque devexae jactaret basia rhedae.

Nemo magis rhombum stupuit ε nam plurima dixit

In laevum converSUS, at illi dextra jacebat

The amomum, from which ‘mummy' is
sometimes erroneously said to be derived,
was an Eastern shrub, and therefore by
the Latin pocts usually called ‘ Assyrium.'
It is described by Pliny (H. N. xii. 13),
who says it grows in India, Armenia,
Media, and Pontus. To what plant the
name was given is now unknown. (See
Forcellini.)

110. Pompeius] This person is not
known. Juvenal says he had the art of
cutting people's throats with a whisper. A
hint was enough. He was a ‘ delator?

112. Fuscus‚] Cornelius Fuscus was em-
ployed by Vespasian in high commands,
and by Domitian as ‘praefectus' of the prae-
torian troops. He was sent by him on an
expedition against the Daci, and was killed,
together with the greater part of his army,
by that people. Tacitus describes him (in
ΑΛ). 69) 35 ‘vigens aetate, claris natalibus‚'
and as one who loved danger for its own
sake. Juvenal says he thought of battles
in his marble villa ε retirement and the de-
grading life of a Roman senator of this day
did not suit him, and he was glad, no doubt,
to be employed on the rough service in
which he lost his life. Ruperti says it is
“capitae-*rmffis dictum de homine ignaro
militiae ac luxuria diffluente qui non in
campo vel castris sed in secessu otioque ar-
tem belli gerendi discit‚'' which is not truc 3
and as Juvenal must have known it was
not true, it is unlikely that this is his
meaning. He had a respect for some of
these people, and thought them too good
for their master.

113. Veiento Catullo‚] Fabricius Veien-
to, whom he calls ‘crafty,' is mentioned
above, iii. 185. In the epistle referred to
in that note, Pliny says that a conversation
at the emperor Nerva's table, on one occa-
sion when Veiento was present, turned
chiefly 011 Catullus Messallinus, whom Pliny

120

describes as blind and of a savage dispo-
sition 3 he had neither reverence, modesty,
nor pity, and so Domitian used him, as a.
man uses arrows, to shoot at all the best οἱ
men. He was dead at the time of this con-
versation. Juvenal says he lusted after a
woman he had no eyes to see.

116. dirusque a ponte satelles,] He
means he was brought from begging at the
bridges, where beggars commonly stood, to
be Domitian’s savage servant. He says the
man was one who should have been found
begging on the AppiaVia of the passengers
in their carriages going down to Aricia,
which was about sixteen miles from Rome,
and full of country 11011595. (Hor. S. i. 5.
1, n.) As the Appia Via approached
Aricia it went down into the Vallis Aricina,
and the descent was called Clivus Aricinus.
It appears that beggars were in the habit of
posting themselves at the top of this hill.
Martial says (11.19) ’ίο 3 man who had given
him a poor dinner ι

“ Debet Aricino conviva recumbere clivo,
Quem tua felicem, Zoile, coena facit.'’

And describing the flitting of Vacerra from
his lodgings with his shabby furniture, lie
says, “Migrare clivum crederes Aricinum.''
(xii. 32. 10.) See also note on Persius, vi.
56 : “ Clivnmque ad Virbi: praesto est mihi
Manius hcrcs.'’ This explains ‘devexae’
‘J actaret basia' is explained above, on iii.
106. Α5 to ‘ponS,' compare S. v. 8 ς xiv.

119. rhombum stupuit :] Juvenal uses
this construction with ‘stupes-e? ‘stupet
haec ' (xiii. 16) ; “ Caerula quis stupuit
Germani 1umina’' (ib. 164). Virgil likewise
has “ Pars stupet innuptae donum exitiale
Minervae'' (Aen. ii. 31). With the later
poets it is common. Horace has other con-
structions, as ‘ stupet aere ' (S. i. 4. 28) and
‘ stupet in titulis ’ (S. i. 6. 17).
