SATIRA VII.

Spirantesque crocos et in urna perpetuum ver,
Qui praeceptorem sancti voluere parentis

Esse loco.

Metuens virgae jam grandis Achilles

210

Cantabat patriis in montibus 5 et cui non tunc
Eliceret risum citharoedi cauda magistri?

Sed Rufum atque alios caedit sua quemque juventus,
Rufum qui toties Ciceronem Allobroga dixit.

Quis gremio Enceladi doctique Palaemonis affert

215

Quantum grammaticus meruit labor? et tamen ex hoc
Quodcunque est (minus est autem quam rhetoris aera)
Discipuli custos praemordet Acoenonctus

Et qui dispensat frangit sibi.
Et patere inde aliquid decrescere, non aliter quam

ovid has these lines on Achilles and his
tencher:

‘⁴ Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achil-
Atiiiiild animos placida contudit arte
Qui {gig socios, toties exterruit hostes
Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas ‘Hector sensurus erat poscente ma-
Veffixsiius jussas praebuit ille manus.”

(A. A. i. 11, sqq.)

Jahn has a comma at ‘montibus' and a
full stop at ‘ magistriss and Mr. Mayor 1133
the following explanation of his meaning:
“ Afraid of the rod, and not then venture-
some enough to laugh, ὄις. ; tune, in that
age of respect for teachers.” And he
adds, “now Rufus and others are struck
by their own pupils.’' 1 have uo doubt
of the right punctuation or of Juvenal's
meaning. [Ribbeck has ‘ magistri.’]

213. Sed Rufum] Rufus the Scholiast
says was a Gaul, and very eloquent. Ju-
venal says he called Cicero an Allobrox, 111
other words, a barbarian. He meant pro-
bably iu comparison with himself ; but his
pupils beat him notwithstanding. The Al-
lobroges were a Gallie tribe on the lest
bank of the Rhone, reaching from the
southern shore of the Lake of Geneva along
that river to its junction with the Saone.
Cicero had a good deal to do with them in
the detection of Catiline’s conspiracy (see
note on Horace, Epod. xvi. 6 z “Novisque
rebus infidelis Allobrox ''). In Plautus a
‘ paedagogus' describes the insolence of
boys to their masters and the support they
got from their fathers very amusingly

Cede, Palaemon,

(Bacchides, Act. iii. sc. 3. v. 34, sqq.). Τ110
passage is too long for quotation here.
[Ribbeck has ‘ sua quaeque juventus,’ and
in the next line ‘quem’ in place of ‘qui.']

215. Quis ,qremio Enceladi] He leaves
speaking of the rhetoric masters and turns
to the teachers of grammar. Palaemon has
been mentioned before (vi. 452). He had
been dead some time. He lived in the time
of Tiberius, and was rich and profligate ac-
cording to Suetonius (de Ill. Gr. 23). En-
celadus or Celadus (for the MSS. vary) is
unknown. He asks, Who ever brings and
pours into the teacher’s lap as much as his
labour deserves? And even of the small
fee the boy's ‘paedagogus ' gets a bit before
it reaches the master. Horace twice uses
‘custos' for the‘ paedagogus,' whom Juvenal
calls ‘pappas’ in the sixth satire (v. 633) ε
“ Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnes
Circum doctores aderat ” (S. i. 6. 81) ; and
“ Imberbus juvenis tandem custode remoto
Gaudet equis canibusque ’' (A. P. 161).
Acoenonetus 3001113, as Grangaeus says, to
be a proper name invented for this gentle-
man, who takes as much and gives as little
as he can. Τ110 Greek ἀκοινώνητος 13 ex-
actly copied. Heinrich so understands it.
Jahn prints the Greek word; and Mr. Mayor,
who follows his text, translates it ‘ selfish?
The Scholiast says it is a ‘ paedagogus ' who
wants common sense. He therefore had
the reading ἆκοινονόητος, which is one of
the variants in the MSS. and is in P.
Others are ‘ acoenetus‚' ‘ acoenetus ipse‚'
which is iu M. and most MSS. The same
variation occurs in the MSS. of Gellius( xii.
12), where Gronovius edits “ atque inter
ridendum ἆκοινονόητοι inquit homines
estis,’' &c. Fax-nabius supposes the name
