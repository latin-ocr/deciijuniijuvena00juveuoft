SATI RA lv, 407

SATIRA IV.

INTRODL'CTION.

ΤΠΕΒΕ is not much to remark in this Satire. Its purpose is to show that men have
little acquaintance with themselves while they are ready to criticize severely the
characters of their neighbouffi, and to take in with delight vulgar flattery. It opens
with a dialogue (if it can be called so, where onc of the persons is only supposed to
utter a dozen words put into his mouth by the other, v. 17, sq.) between Socrates and
Alcibiadoe‚in which the teacher remonstrates with his favourite on his vanity and self-
confidence, just as he does in Plato‘s dialogue, Alcibiades Prior ; from which some of
the expressions in this scene are taken, and the scene itself is evidently copied. This
part illustrates the first point in the Satire, which is men’s ignorance of themselves.
Their unkindness to others follows. Yon have only to name a man, and straightway
his character is abused and his faults exaggerated; his good qualities are never men-
tioned. But though men may hide their sore places from the world and delight them-
selves in flattery, they cannot cheat conscience altogether. Τὶιο moral is that men
should scorn to be called what they are not ; throw back the flattery of the vulgar on
themselves; and make their own breast their home, that they may lcarn how little they
have there to be proud of.

ARGUMENT.

What, γοα become a statesman? (suppose that Socrates is speaking.) Trusting in
what, O ward of Pericles? No doubt you’re wise beyond your γεω-8, and so the
people when their passions rise will surely listen to you, saying, ‘ Citizens‚ I tell you
this is wrong—’twere better so? Yon can weigh justice in the balance, you can tell
straight from crooked. Yon cannot Ρ Then as you're only fair outside, why show
your gaudy tail before your day to an admiring crowd? You're only fit for
hellebore. What is your happiness P ‘ To eat good dishes and to bask in the sun?
Hold, this old woman could but answer so. Well, boast your beauty and descent,
only allow that Baucis crying herbs for slaves to buy is wisc as you.

V. 23. No man goes down into himself, but all can see the pack upon their neighbour’s
shoulders. Ask a man thus, ‘ Know you Vcctidius' estate, the man who owns broad
lands at Cures ?' ¹ What he (the man replies) the wretch, who on a holiday eats
onions raw, washed down with sour old wine he scarce has the beart to draw θ’ Οι-
if you’re a free liver, some one will touch you on the elbow and drag your character
through the mire.

V. 42. We strike and in our turn are struck again. These are the terms wc live on z
so much experience teaches us! You've a deep sore within, but your broad belt
conceals it. Well, try and cheat your conscience if you can. ⁴ But if my neighbonrs
praise me shall I not believe them ?’ If money turns you pale, if you indulge your
Iuste, or ifyou cheat in the Forum, ’tis vain to drink the flattery of the vulgar ς
scorn to be what you are not: give the cobbler back his offering 5 live with yourself,
and you shall see how scantily furnished is your home.
