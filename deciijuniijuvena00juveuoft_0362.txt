Mobilis et varia est ferme natura malorum :

230. missum acl sua corpora morbum]
See note on Hor. C.' 1i. 8. 1:

“Ulla sijuris tibi pejer· ati

Poena, Bariue, nocuisset unquam,

Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
Turpior ungui,

233. Laribus cristam promittere galli]
See note on xii. 96, and as to‘ sacello' see
S. x. 354, n. With ‘nocentibus aegris'
compare v. 124. It means ‘the sick if
they be guilty!

235. vel quae non cli-qnior hostia vita ἲ]
This is most severe of all. The life of
any animal that could be offered in sacri-
fice was worth more than his. The theory
of sacrifice rests upon the innocence of the
victim, and mischievous animals would not
be accepted.

236. Mobilis et υανὶα est] He says by
way of consoling· his friend that the man
who has cheated him is sure to come to
punishment; for such is generally (ferme)
the nature of the wicked that they fluctuate
between sin and remorse ε while their crime
is doing they are firm enough ς but when
it is done they find out when it is too late
(tandem) the difference between right and
wrong, but then again they go back to
the practices conscience had condemned,
as Horace says in a different connexion,

Dabit in laqueum vestigia noster

“Naturam expellas furca, tamen usquo
recurret '’ (Epp. i. 10. 24). The Jewish
proverbs, “As a dog returneth to his vomit,
so a fool returneth to his folly,” and “the
sow that was washed has returned to its
wallowing in the mire‚’' will occur to every
one. ‘Fas nefasque' are often joined, as
in Hor. Epod. v. 87: “Venena magnum
fas nefasque non valent‚” ὅτε.
240. mutari nescia ι] See S. xiv. 231, n.
242. attrita de fronte] This is like
‘frons durior' in S. viii. 189. ‘Dabit in
laqueum vestigia' is he will put his foot
in his own snare, he will bc caught in
his guilt some day and suffer for it, he
will be strangled in prison and dragged
out with a hook as criminals were (see
S. x. 66, 11., “ Sejanus ducitur unco ;’' and
Cic. pro C. Rabirio, c. 5, “a verberibus, ab
unco, a crucis denique terrore‚'’ Long's
note), or banished to Seriphos or some of
those places. See note on S. i. 73: “Ande
aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum.'’
Ruperti says ‘uncum ' is a hook or ring in·
the prison wall to which the man's chain
was attached. ‘Exsulibus magnis' does
not mean that they were great in any
thing but wickedness. ‘Nominis' means
the man, a common use of* ονομα, but not
of‘ nomen.’ Tiresias the prophet of Thebes
was blind. His story is told by Ovid in
the 3rd book of the Metamorphoses, 316—
