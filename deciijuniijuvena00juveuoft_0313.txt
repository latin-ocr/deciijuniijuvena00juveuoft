Thersites, in qua se traducebat Ulixes

Ancipitem 5) scu tu mag-no discrimine causam
Protegere atl'ectas, tc consule, dic tibi quis sis,
Orator vehemens an Curtius ct Matho buccae.

Noscenda est mensura sui spectandaque rebus

In summis minimisque; etiam quum piscis emetur,
Ne mullum cupias quum sit tibi gobio tantum

“ Quam male inaequales veniant ad aratra
juvenci,
Tam premitur magno conjuge nupta
mmor:
Non honor est sed onuS, species laesura
ferentem ;
Si qua voles apte nubere, nube pari.”

The chorus in Aeschylus (Proin. Vinc.
887) says he was a elever man who first
put forth this doctrine:

τὸ κηδεῦσαι καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἀριστεύει μακρῷ.

Horace says of himself if he, as a freed-
man's son, were to suceeed corruptly in
getting made a senator, the censor would
remove him, “ Vel merito quoniam in pro-
pria non pelle quiessem '' (S. i. 6. 22). This
is what Juvenal means when he tells men
they had better know themselves if they
think of aspiring to a place in the Seuatc.
He gives it more consideration than it de-
sei-ved when he wrote.

30. nec enim loricam poscit] Thersites
knew himself better than to try for
Achilles' armour in which Ulysses cut a
doubtful figure. ‘Traducere’ is used iu
this sense of exposure in S. viii. 17. Ru-
perti has two pages of doubts about these
simple lines, because somebody says Ther-
sites was killed by a kuoek on the head
from Achilles himself, so he could not
contend for his armour. Either therefore
Juvenal foi-got his history or else altered

’ it. And Achaintre says we nowhere read

that the Greeks laughed at Ulysses; on
the eontmry, they adjudged the armour to
him. But Ruperti aster all admits that,
in his humble judgment, the lines may
stand if only ‘ poscat' be substituted for
‘poscite Heinecke (Animadv. p. 35, sqq.)
is still more diffuse and quite furious in
his objections. ‘Ancipitem’ agrees with
‘ se? lt means that he did not look like
himself, people did not know him in the
ιιι-1110111· of Achilles. The editors gene-
rally take ‘ancipitem’ with ‘caustum’
which does not want it, for ‘magno dis-

criniine' is much stronger. Heinrich
takes it with ‘ se.'

32. seu Ιιι magno discrimine causam]
“Or if you aspire to defend a cause of
great niccty, consult yourself, and tell
yourself which you are, a powerful pleader
or such as Curtius and Matho, mere
cheeks.'' ‘ Seu ’ (32) is opposed to ‘ sivc'
in 28 (sive quaeras vel velis—seu affectas),
and a new verb is introduced, a common
change of construction (S. xii. 102, n.).
Before Curtius Heinrich would read ‘ aut.'
The MSS. vary between ‘an’ aud ‘et.’
‘ Aut' would seem better. As to ‘ emtor '
see above, S. i. 32, n„ where the ‘ causidi-
cus Matho' is mentioned. Whether Cur-
tius is the man Montanus (S. iv. 107) is
uncertain. ‘ Buceae' is used for a rant-
ing noisy fellow who blows out his cheeks
like a bladder, and emits nothing but the
wind that fills them: “jactanticuli qui
tantuin buccas inflant et nihil dicunt? as
the Scholiast says. See iii. 35, ‘⁸ notaeque
per oppida buccae‚’' for horn-blowers.

35. Noscenda est mensura sui] This is
like Horace’s “Metiri se quemque suo mo-
dulo ae pede verum est'’ (Epp. i. 7. 98).
See vi. 357 :

“Multis res angusta domi est: sed nulla
pudorem
Paupertatis habet, nec se metitur ad
Qiielriiud’edit haee posuitque modum.'’

‘Gobio’ or ‘cobio,’ as it appears to be
sometimes spelt, is a gudgeon. ‘Saeculus‚’
(27), ‘loculus,’ ‘crumena' are all the
same, a leather purse worn in the folds
of the toga or the girdle. See S. i. 89,
xiii. 139, and xiv. 297. ‘Loculus' is
always used in the plural, Foreellini
thinks, because there were several eom-
partments for holding different kinds of
coin. For ‘cruniena,' on the nuth ›rity of
two Frcneli MSS. and a doubtful reading
in 1’., Jahn has ‘culinn‚’ in which Her-
mann and Mayor have done well not to
follow him. [Ribbeck has ‘crumina.']
