D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Temptarent, nee foedum alii nec turpe putarent 5
Praecones fieri 3 quum desertis Aganippes

V allibus esuriens migraret in atria Clio.

Nam si Pieria quadrans tibi nullus in umbra

Ostendatur, ames nomen victumque Machaerae,

dendum‚'' as Ruperti says3 they may or
may not have sold lread. Horace joins
lligths and bakeries together m Epp. i. 11.

 

Frigus collegit furnos et biilit‘iegullmdan
Ut fortunatam plene praestantia vitam .’'

C. S. Curio (edit. Henninii) quotes what he
says was a proverb applied to ehilly per-
sons (qui assidue frigerent tremerentque),

“numquam eos de balneo aut furno con-
ducendo eogitasse:'' and this he says ex-
plains the above passage of Horace, which
1 do not believe. Grangaeus steals from
Curio without acknowledgment.

6. Praeconesfieri ;] The business of the
auctioneer’s ‘ praeco’ was among other
things to get persons to attend 3 as Horace

says (Ars Poet. 419) :

“Ut praeco, ad merces turbam qui cogit
emendas,
Assentatores jubet ad lucrum ire poeta.''

Therefore the Scholiast calls them ‘emis-
sarii.' Martial advises his friend Lupus,
who was doubting how he should bring up
his son, by no means to send him to the
grammar schools 5 but,

“Artes discere vult pecuniosas P

Fac discat citharoedus aut choraules.

Si duri puer ingeni videtur,

Praeconem facias vel architectum.''

v. 56.
In another place he commends aii old nian
who gave his daughter in marriage to a
‘ praec0‚' though two praetor-s, four tri-
bunes, seven lawyers, and ten poets, had
asked for her. So the praeco’s was a
thriving business. But there were various
sorts. See the note on Horace quoted
above on S. iii. 157.
desertis Ayam'ppes Vallibus] On the

eastern ascent, from Ascra, of Mount Heli-
con in Boeotia was the fountain Aganippe,
which as the Scholiast says, quoting Caui-
machus, was the source, or one of the
feeders of the Permessus, a stream which
flowed into the Lacus Copais. The valleys
on that side of the range were fruitful and
woody. The waters of this fountain, like
that of Hippocrene considerably higher
up, were supposed to inspire those who

drank them. The grove of the Muses
(Pieria umbra) lay between these two
fountains, and the position is identified by
Col. Leakc with that of the convent of
St. Nieholas now existing at the foot of
Mount Marandali.

7. migraret in atria clia] The atria
here meant are not the antechambers of the
rich, as Ruperti says, but the courts in
which auctions were held, as Lubinus
observes, quoting Cic. Pro P. Quin. e. 3,

“Tollitur ab atriis Liciniis atque a prae-
conum consessu in Galliam Naevius ’' (see
Long's note). See also c. 6, “Ipse suos
necessarios ab atriis Liciniis et a faucibus
macelli corrogat They are mentioned
again by Cicero (de Lege Agrar. i. 3):

“At hoc etiam nequissimi homines con-
sumptis patrimoniis faciunt, ut in atriis
auctionariis potius quam in triviis aut in

lclompitis auctionentur.'' [Martial (viii. 3)
as

“ Et quum rupta situ Messalae saxa jaee-
Allgsslii} (fluum Licini marmora pulvis
erun .'’

8. Nam si Pieria] He has just been
speaking of the Muses iu connexion with
Helicon and Boeotia. Here he calls the
grove Pieria, using the conventional name
of the Muses, though the Pieria of histori-
cal times lay north of Olympus. Miiller
(Hist. Gr. Lit. p. 27) accounts for the
confusion of Pieria and Boeotia by saying
that the Pierians lived in Boeotia and
Phocis near the ranges of Helicon and Par-
nassus till the time of the Dorian and
Aeolian migration. (See note on Hor. A. P.
405.) ‘ Pieria umbra' is the grove men-
tioned on v. 6. Ruperti’s note on this
‘umbra' is a specimen of his loose stylo
of commentary.

9. ames nomen victumque Machaerae,]
‘Amare' is used like the Greek στέργειν,

ἐὰΑ-γιιιῙ-ιξῖὶἒὸἱὲ to be content with,' as in Horace,

“ Non ego inornata. et dominantia nomina
solum

Verbaqge,”Pisones, Satyrorum scriptor
ama o,

which Heinrich quotes with other places
