aeris auri argentique venae in commune
fluxere.'' Strabo (viii. p. 381) says that
Polybius, among other stories illustrating
the ignorance ot'the soldiers and their con-
tempt sor the works of art, declares he
saw pictures thrown flat upon the ground,
and soldiers playing draughts upon them.
Of Mummius himself a good story is told
by VeUeius (i. 13) as evidence of his igno-
rance. He contracted with certain persons
for the carriage of some of the fines-t pic-
tures and statues to Italy3 and ordered
the contractors to be told that if they lost
any of them they must supply their place
with new ones. [But Mummius, who was
a sensible man, must have known what he
was saying. He was joking.]

103. Ut phaleris qauderet equus,] The
bridles and harness of horses were com-
monly much ornamented with metal. ‘ Pha-
lerae' include all the harness and trappingS.
As to ‘cassis ’ see x. 134, 11. A fitting
device for a helmet would 118 1118 she-wolf
that suckled Romulus and his brother,
being tamed by the destiny of Rome. The
two brothers are called Quirini, as Castor
and Pollux are called Castores· For in-
stanees of the latter see Foreefflni, v.
Castor. Horace has “ Aura feret gemi-
nusque Pollux ’² for “ gemini fratres Castor
et Pollux.'' On the shield of Aeneas,
according to virgil, the artist

“ Fecerat et viridi fetam Mavortis in antro
Pro-cubuisse lupam, geminos huic ubera

Imtga‘igidosss’ (Aen. viii. 630, sqq.)
106. Ac medam effigiem] There is sup-

posed tobe on the helmet a naked figure of

Mars coming down from heaven with shield

and spear, and still in the air, just as he is

represented 111 a medai of Antoninus Pius

when he is visiting Ilia asleep. The Scho-
liast‚ who had probably seen this group,
says that this is what the soldier has 011 his
helmet, though nothing can be less pro-
bablc. Addison (Travels, p. 182) takes
credit for this interpretation : but he might
have got it, if he did not, from the Scholiast.
Spcnce (l‘olymetiS‚ p. 77) says “it was by
the help of this medal that Mr. Addison has
so finely and so fully explained a passage in
Juvenal which had been strangely misunder-
stood before his time‚”and others have taken
this explanation for granted. The medal
may be found in most collections. It is in
Plate viii. of Spence. There has been a
great deal written about this passage, but
1 see no great difficulty in it. Juvenal
must have seen a figure such as he de-
scribes like that on the above medal.
‘ Clipeo venientis et hasta' is the same
construction as ‘ pugnanti Gorgone ’ in the
next satire, v. 4. Many MSS. have ‘ful-
gentis ' for ‘ venientis.’

108. Argenti quod erat] Thislooks very
like an interpolation, and so the modern
editors view it [and Ribbeck also] It is
wanting in four or five MSS„ and comes
after 109 in several.

109. Tusco farrata catino ;] Etruscan
pottery was very common, as we know from
the abundant specimens that remain. See
Pers. S. ii. 60. ‘ Farrata ’ is equivalent to
‘pultes’ above, v. 58. ‘ Ponere’ is used
ordinarily for putting on the table. See
Hor. S. ii. 2. 23: “ posito pavone ;'’ 4. 14:
“ Longa quibus facies ovis erit illa me-
mento Ponere.’' Epp. i. 12. 7 : “ in medio
positorum abstemius?

110. Omnia tuncquz'bus invideas] “Every
thing in those days was such as you might
envy ifyou are inclined to a little jcalousy.’'
[Jahn points thus: ί(11111110, Omnia tunc,'
and Ribbeck ‘ catino Omnia tunc :']
