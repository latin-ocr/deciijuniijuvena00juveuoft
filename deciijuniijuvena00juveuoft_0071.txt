from the text. The Scholiast says more
truly that Juvenal is speaking generally
against those who gain their bad ends by
poison. ‘ Pensilibus plumis ' iuvans a ‘ lec-
tica' with sost feather-bed and cushions,
raised aloft on men's shoulders.

162. Securus licet Aeneam] ‘You may
safely set Aeneas and Turnus fighting ;
Achilles will not hurt you if you write of
1115 death at the hand of Paris 3 and Hylas is
at the bottom of the well with his piu-her,
so you may say what you like about him!
Hylas was a favouritc of Hercules; drawing
water at a well he was dragged 111 by the
nymphS, and Hercules sought 111111 long,
sori-owing and calling upon 1115 11111110, and
set the people of the country (Mysia) to
seek him, · a subject much handled by the
old poets. Vix-gil asksff ‘Cui 11011 dictus
Hylas puer?'’ (G'eorgs 111. 6.) ‘Committere’
is to match one agains 51 another. So he
says below (vi. 436)· “Committit vates et
comparatss’

165. Eme velut stricto] This reminds
us of Horace, S.· 11. 1. 39, sqq.:

“—— Sed hic stilus haud petet ultro
Quemquam animantem, et me veluti cus-
todiet ensis
Vagina tectus 3 quem curdistringere coner
Tutus ab infestis latronibus ?’'

What Ruperti says about Damocles’ sword
is ridiculous.

167. tacita sudant praecordia eulpa] A
eold sweat coming over the beart through
the power of conscience and the fear of ex-
posui-e is a forcible description. ‘ Praecor-
dia’ are the intestines rather than the heart.
Iu these passion and feeling had their seat,

according to the Romans: the beart was
the seat of intelligent-e.

168. Inde irae et lacrimae] Terenee's
“Hinc illae laerimae’' (Andr. i. 1. 99) came
to be a. proverb. Horace uses it, Epp. i.
19. 41; aud Cicero likewise (pro Coelio,
c. 25).

169. ante {ubas ³] Before the battle is
begun. When a man has put on his 011110111-
11 15 100 11110 to draw back. The substance
of his friend’s advice is, that if he must
write he had better attack those who are
dead and gone; and the poet says 110 will
follow his advice. From this it might be
inferred that this Satire was written be-
fore the others. But I do not think it
is a proof that can be depended upon.
The ‘ via Latina ’ was the oldest road out
of Rome, aud ran through the beart of
Latium to Beneventum, where the ‘Via
Appia ’joined it. The ⁴ Via Flaminia' has
been mentioned above, v. 61. The chief
roads leading out of Rome were lined
for several miles with the tombs of the
1101111111οι- citizens, 111111111 111111111 1110 1111115
of the city being forbidden 111 1110 1110110
tables. “Hominem in urbe 110 sepelito
11010 urito” (Cic. deLegg. ii. 23). So that
burning was practised 115 early as the decem-
virate. It grew afterwards into general use,
and was not discontinued till the end of the
second century of the Christian era (see
Becker's Gall.. Exc. on the interment of the
dead). Heinrich supposes J 111-011111, by men-
tioning the Flaminiam and Latin roads‚ to
hint at Domitian and his favour-ite, Paris
the actor, of whom the former was buried
ou the Via Flaminia, and the other on the
via Latina.
