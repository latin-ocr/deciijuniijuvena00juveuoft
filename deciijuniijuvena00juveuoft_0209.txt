SATIRA VI. 15⁴.)

Livida materno servent adipata veneno.

Grande Sophocleo carmen bacchamur hiatu,

Montibus ignotum Rutulis caeloque Latino !
Nos utinam vani! sed clamat Pontia, “ Feci,
Confiteor, puerisque meis aconita paravi,

Quae deprensa patent ε facinus tamen ipsa peregi.”

Tune duos una, saevissima vipera, coena?

Tune duos? “ Septem, si septem forte fuissent.’¹
Credamus tragicis quidquid de Colchide saeva
Dicitur et Procne: nil contra conor: et illae

father, and whose property was looked
aster by a tutor. The care of his person
belonged to his mother (see note on Hor.
Epp. i. 1. 20: “ut piger annus Pupillis
quos dura premit custodia matrum '').
‘Adipata' are cakes mixed with lard (see
Forcellini). ‘Livida’ and ‘fervent' ex-
press the effect of the poison on the coin-
plexion and the bowels.

633. timidus praegustetpoeulapappas]
‘ Pappas ' is the ‘ paedagogus.’ ‘ Praegus-
tatores’ waitcd on the emperors from Au-
gustus downwards. See note on Hor. S. ii.
6. 109: “praelambens omne quod afl'ert.”
On this and the preceding verse the Scho-
liast says, “sequuntur duo versiculi qui in
aliis non sunt.’' They are not in 1³„ but
Pithoeus has editaed them. Some Paris
MSS. want them, and Jahn has marked
them as doubtful. [Ribbeck omits them.]

634. Fingimus haec] “This is all an
invention, you may say, and my satire is
putting on the tragic cothurnus.'' ‘ Prio-
rum' are Lucilius, Horace, Persius and
others who had written before him. ‘ Hiatu ’
refers to the mask with its wide mouth.
The later masks, even sor tragedy, had
exaggerated features and a large mouth,
which does not appear in the earlier. (See
Smith’s Dict. Ant„ ‘Persona.') The Ro-
mans always represented the dignity of
tragedy by the plays of SophocleS‚ whom
they knew therefore how to estimate.

638. sed clamat Pontia, ‘⁶ Feci‚] He says
he wishes what he has been saying was
false, but there is Pontia who not only
poisoned her two children but boasted of it.
The Scholiast on this place says, “ She was

the daughter of Petronius, who was con-
victed of a conspiracy against Nero. After
her husband’s death she murdered her chil-
dren, and being convicted, she ate a great
supper and drank a quantity oswine, opencd
her veins, and then died ‹lancing, an amuse-
ment she was very fond of. Her name be-
came a proverb. ‘ O mater qua nec Pontia
deterior.''' (Martial, ii. 34. 6.) Martial else-
where speaks of “iratam Pontiae lagenam”
(iv. 43. 5). Her motive for this horrid
crime is not mentioned, but Juvenal seems
to imply it was for money she did it (646).
What would he have said to mothers poison-
ing their children for burial-money ?

640. sac-inus tamen ipsa pereffl'] ‘⁸ The
act has been discovered and cannot be con-
cealed3 but still Ι boast that Ι did it.’' It
must be admitted that this is not very satis-
factory. She may mean that if people arc
inclined to disbelieve the verdict, she will
not let theni3 or that she not only got the
poison (paravi), which the evidence had
proved, but that she administered it with
her own hand. Heinrich, after Guietus,
prefers reading ‘ tantuin ³ for ‘ tamen‚'

thinking -t-he abbreviation ‘ti—n ’ may have

become ‘ tn ’ in the MSS. ‘ Tantum ’ may
be right, and it makes the sense plain.
The two words are sometimes confounded
in the MSS. See Long‘s note on Cic. pro
Sulla, c. 19, vol. iii. Jahn's punctuation is
lame, “ facinus : tamen ipsa peregi.'’ [Rib-
beck's is the same]

6-13. cle Colchide saeva] Medea. Procne
killed her son Itys to punish his father, Τυ-
reus· He says these stories may well be
believed. There is less reason to wonder
