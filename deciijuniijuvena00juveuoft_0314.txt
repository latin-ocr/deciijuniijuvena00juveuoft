In loculis.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quis enim te deficiente crumena

Et crescente gula manet exitus, aere paterno

Ac rebus mersis in ventrem, fenoris atque

40

Argenti gravis et pecorum agrorumque capacem?
Talibus a dominis post cuncta novissimus exit
Annulus, et digito mendicat Pollio nudo.

Non praematuri cineres nec funus acerbum

Luxuriae, sed morte magis metuenda senectus,

Hi plerumque gradus : conducta pecunia Romae
Et coram dominis consumitur 3 inde ubi paullum
Nescio quid superest et pallet fenoris auctor,
Qui vertere solum Baias et ad Ostia currunt :

Cedere namque foro jam non est deterius quam

‘Argentum grave’ is silver in bars or plates
(laminae).

39. Et crescente ιᾳτιῑα] That is ‘et ta·
men,’ as we have it repeatedly.

42. Talibus α dominis] Heinrich ob-
jects to ‘ dominis,' and asks what it means.
He thinks ‘damnis’ is the word in the
sense of ‘expenseS,' quoting vi. 508:
“Nulla viri cura interea, nee mentio fiet
Da1nn0rum.” ‘ A' would then be ‘asten'
which is a common meaning. The MSS.
do not vary, and ‘ dominis' has reference
to the property in the last line, ‘from
such masters.' But Heinrich’s word is
ingenious, and very little authority would
induce me to adopt it. One MS. has

‘dmis,’ which might be ‘damnis.' The
ring was the mark of equestrian or sena-
torian rank (Horace, S. ii. 7. 9, n.). Pollio
belongs to one of those orders. Crepereius
Pollio is mentioned above (S. ix. 6), and
he may be the man. Pliny mentions one
Carvilius Pollio as a baukrupt spendthrift
H. N. ix. 15 .

( 44. Non pinematuri cineres] He says
it is not premature death that is sorrow
to the riotous liver‚ but he has more
reason to fear age than death, an old age
of bankruptcy and exile from the scene
of his pleasures. He says the stages are,
first the borrowing of money, then the
lavish spending of it under the eyes of the
lenders; then, when only a little is left,
the lender begins to be alarmed, and the
debtor runs away, and when he does so,
all he cares for is the loss of his amuse-
ments, he has no shame for cheating his
creditors. ‘Luxuria' has always a bad
sense. Luxury does not express it. It
is wauton excess. As to ‘conducta pe-
cunia,' see note on Hor. S. i. 2. 9: “Om-

50

nia conductis coemens obsonia nummis.”
‘Conducta' is not common in the sense
‘Dominis' are the lenders
of the money. The word is suitable in
connexion with ‘conductis.’ The ‘domi-
nus' might be said ‘locare pecuniam,’
as the borrower is said ‘conducere-⁵
‘ Paullum nescio quid' is a way of ex-
pressing a very little. ‘Fenoris auctor'
for ‘fenerator' is an uncommon expres-
sion. It is akin to ‘auctor' in the sense
of ‘ vendor? ‘ Solum vertere ³ is a sort of
euphemism for going into voluntary exile
or running away. Cicero explains the
phrase: “ Qui volunt poenam aliquam
subterfugere aut calamitatem eo solum
vertunt, hoc est sedem ac locum mutant '’
(pro A. Caecina, c. 34).

49. Baias et ad Ostia eurrunt:] They
must leave Rome, but they go -to the
pleasantest places they can. As to Baiae
see S. iii. 4, n. The MSS. vary about
Ostia. The common reading is ‘ostreae
for which Baiae was famous. Many
MSS. and most of the old editions have
Ostia, which Heinrich has adopted. [Jahn
and Ribbeck have ‘ostrea.'] Although
Ostia had ceased to be the port of Rome
when this satire was written, it continued
to be a flourishing town throughout the
period of the empire (S. xii. 75, n.).

50. Cedere namque foro] To leave the
forum is another way of expressing the
running away from one's creditors. All
the principa] bankers and money-lenders
had their place in the Forum Romanum.
‘ Deterius’ is equivalent to ‘turpius.' It
does not liurt a man’s character more to
give his creditors the slip than to change
his house from the Suburra to the Esqui-
line, which elsewhere he calls ‘gelidae'

of ‘ mutua.'
