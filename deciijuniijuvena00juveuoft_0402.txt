D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Hujus enim quod nunc agitur miserabile debet
Exemplum esse cibi ς sicut modo dicta mihi gens
Post omnes herbas, post cuncta animalia, quidquid

Cogebat vacui ventris furor, hostibus ipsis

Pallorem ac maciem et tenues miserantibus artus,
Elembra aliena fame lacerabant esse parati

Et sua.

Quisnam hominum veniam dare, quisve deorum

Viribus abnuerit dira atque immania passis,

Et quibus illorum poterant ignoscere manes
