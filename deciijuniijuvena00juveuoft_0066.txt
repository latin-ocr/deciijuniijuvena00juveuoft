Vincant divitiae, sacro nec cedat honori

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

110

Nuper in hanc urbem pedibus qui venerat albis ,-
Quandoquidem inter nos sanctissima divitiarum
Majestas, etsi funesta Pecunia templo

Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum ereximus aras,

Ut colitur Pax atque Fides, Victoria, Virtus,

115

Quaeque salutato crepitat Concordia nido.

the plural Licinis, where only one person
is meant, sce note 011 Horace, S. i. 7. 8.

110. sacro nec cedat honori] The person
of the ‘tribunus plebis ³ was inviolable, ‘sa-
crosanctus' (Liv. ii. 33). Marti-al has (viii.
66) “ Et Cacsar genero sacros honores ;'’
and Virgil (Aen. iii. 4842), “ Nee cedit hono-
ri.'' Some editions have ‘ ne cedat.²

111. pedibu-s· qui venerat albim] The
Scholiast 11115 a note here, which need not
be attended to. Slaves newly imported
are generally said to have been chalked on
the soles oftheir feet when exposed for sale.
(See Dict. Ant„ Art. ‘ Servus,' 872, 11.)
Ovid says, “ Gypsati crimen inane pcdis’'
(Am. i. 8. 62) ; and Propertius speaks of
slaves for sale,

‘ ‘ ———quorum titulus perbarbara colla pe-

pendit
Cretati medio cum saluere foro '³

(iv. 5. 51); but what could have been the
use of chalking their soles is not obvious
to me. They may have worn white slippers
perhaps, or something of that sort.

112. divitiarum Majesffasgy This con-
denses Horace's “ Virtus, fama, decus, di-
vina humanaque pulchris Divitiis parent ''
(S. ii. 3. 95).

113. fitne-sta Pecunia] Compare Horace,
Epp. i. 6. 37, “ Et genus et formam regina
Pecunia donat,’' where I have quoted the
Christian writers on whose authority Pe-
cunia is said to have been worshipped.
Seneca (de Provid. 0. 5) says, “Non sunt
divitiae bonum. Itaque habeat illas et
Ellius leno : ut homines Pecuniam cum in
templis consecraverint videant et in for-
nice.'’ From which it would seem there
were statues of Pecunia in the temples.

115. Ut colitur Par atque Fides,] This
group is found in Horace, C. S. 57 1

“ Jam Fides et Pax et Honos Pudorque
Priscus et neglecta redire Virtus
Audet‚”

where I have a note 011 cach of these divi-
nities. The temple of Pax was one of the
handsomest buildings iu Rome, and was
situated ou the Via Sacra, about the point

where the declivity eonnncnced called
(Horace, C. iv. 2. 35) Sacer Clivus, which
led down to the Forum Romanum. It
was begun by Claudius and finished by
Vespasian, who deposited in it the spoils of
Jerusalem brought to Rome by Titus.
(Joseph. Β. J. vii. 37.) It was burnt down
in the reign of Commodus, about 120 years
after it was built. Fides had a temple 011
Mons Capitolinus, which was said to have
been founded originally by Numa, and was
afterwards restored in the consulship of M.
Aemilius Scaurus, A. U. c. 639. No less
than three temples of Victoria are men-
tioned, one of which was in the Forum,
another 011 Mons Palatinus, and a third on

⁴Mons Aventinus. That on the Palatino

was said bytradition to have been originally
built by Evander. In his first consulship
M. Marcellus built a temple to Virtus near
the Porta Capena, from which the Via
Appia began.

116. crepitat Concordia nida] “Con-
cordia, who twitters when the birds salute
their nest ;’' that is, her temple sounds with
the twittering of the birds. There was a
beautiful temple to Concordiain the Carinae,
originally built by Furius Camillus after the
expulsion of the Gauls, A. U. c. 364, and
restored by Livia, Augustus' wife. >See Ovid‚
Fast. vi. 637:

“ Te quoque magnifica, Concordia, dedicat
aede
Livia quam caro praestitit illa viro.'’

See also Fast. i. 639, sq. There was
another that stood between the Capitol and
the Forum, in which the senate sometimes
held their meetings. Sall. B. Cat. 49. Cic.
Phil. ii. 8. Some say that the crow, others
that the stork was the bird sacred to Con-
cordia. John of Salisbnry says (Nugae, &e. i.
13), “ Ciconia quoniam avis Concordiae est
concordiam invenit et concordiam facit?
Aelian (de Animalibus, l. iii.) gives this
honour to the crow. thichever it was
Juvenal supposes some bird to have built its
nest on the temple of Concordia. Smne
MSS. have ‘ciconia,’ the first syllable of
which is short, and it would have no mean-
