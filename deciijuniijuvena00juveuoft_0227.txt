124.Aemilio dabitur quantum libet,] He
says that if the ‘patronus’ be a inan of
family, he will get as high a fee as he
pleases. The legal limitation is mentioned
in the last note, and if the reading of the
text is right, the statement may be taken
with a qualification, or he means the law
would not be enforced against such a per-
son. The MSS. vary between ‘petitss

‘petetss ‘licet‚' and‘ libet! The last icad-
ing appears in one Paris and a V atican MS.
Heinrich thought it the bes t w‚ord but' 111
his text‘ petet’ appearS, which is in most
of the old editions. ‘ Licet ' appears in P.
and some other MSS. of good character,
and is explained by the state of the law
about sees, Ruperti, Jahn [and Ribbeck]
have ‘licet.’ 1 prefer ‘libet' He calls
the man Aemilius because the Aemilia was
one of the oldest of the patrician fainilies.
‘ Et melius’ is, ‘ and yet we conduct our
cases better than he doeS.’ (See S. xiii.
912 “Hic putat esse deos et pejerat.”)
He puts himself in the place of one of
these ‘causidici.’

125. stat curru-s· aeneus-,J This man had
atriumphal chariot in his house, which had
been handed down from one of his great
ancestors, and an equestrian statue of him-
self as a stout soldier with a. lance in his
hand. See S. viii. 3 : “stantes in curribus
Aemilianos.'' The commentators quote
Martia] (ix. 69) to show that successful
lawyers had statues given them by their
clients:

“Tam grave percussis incudibus aera re-
Casulizliiiigii’m medio cum faber aptat
equo.

Such a thing may have happened. ‘ Lusca ’
seems to mean here no more than blind. It
is usually ‘onc·eyed,’ and some explain it
as if one of the statue’s eyes were shut in
the act of taking aim. 1 do not think a

statue was ever seen with one eye shut. As
to ‘ vestibulum ’ sec i. 132, n. ‘ Hastile
minatur ' is, ‘he poises his lance threaten-
ingly? ‘ Minari ' is not used elsewhere ex·
actly in this way. The lance bend:¹ as a long
weapon with a light shaft would.
1:2³5. Sic Pedo conturbat‚] Such being
the case, Pedo and these other ‘causidici‚'
meu of low birth and no means, thought to
get fees by pretending to be somebody, and
the consequence was they became bankrupt.
‘Conturbare ’ is an elliptical expression,
‘rationes ' being understood. It iinplies a.
fraudulent banhuptcy, a confusing of ac-
counts. (See Forccllini.) ‘ Deficere’ is to
f xil, as we say. Pedo is unknown. Matho
has been mentioned before (S. i. 32, n.).
Martial has an epigram upon one Tongilius
(ii. 40), who was a glutton, and ordered
bathing for his health3 but there is no
reason to suppose the same man is meant.
‘ Rbinocerote ' means a horn vessel of oil.
Martial has an epigram of two lines on such
a vessel, ‘ Guttus corneus ' (xiv. 52) ι

“ Gestavit modo fronte me juvencus.
Verum rhinocerota me putabis.”

See iii. 263, n.: “
gutto.” This man, to show his conse-
quence, goes to bathe with a crowd os
clients, and goes through the forum in his
‘lectica' with a long pole, making fine
purchases The hearers are Basta-ns, as
in vi. 351: “Quam quae longorum vehitur
cervice S? rorum. '' See note there and on
S. i. 64,‘ ‘sexta cervice feraturss’ and S.· ιίἰ.
240,“ ‘ingenti curret super ora Liburnol’

Slaves froin Moesia are spoken of as hearers
below (ix. 143), and Lipsius thinks Moesos
is the reading here (Epp. Quaest. iv. 25),
because the Parthians (or Medes) were not
under the power of the Romans. But their
name had long been taken for all Easterns.
See Hor. C. i. 2. 21, n. As to ‘murrina'
[In v. 128 Ribbeck has

N
