18. Geminos, horoscope, varo] ‘ Horo-
scopus' is the star of onc’s nativity. He
says others may not think and feel as he
doeS, for the star that waits on the birth
even of twins sometimes brings them into
the world with different Genii. This is
one of the many ways of putting the same
thing. Varro (quoted in my note on
Hor. Epp. i. 7. 94) says the Genius is
“Deus qui praepositus cst, ac vim habet
omnium rerum gignendarum,'’ and Ho-
race rever-ses Persius’ order, and speaks
of a man's Genius as that “natale coines
qui temperat astrum, Naturae deus hu-
manae.” See above, S. v. 45, sqq.; ii.
8, n.; iv. 27. ‘Producere‚’ ‘to bring
into life: is used of the father or mother.
See Juv. viii. 271, and Forcellini, who
givoe no other instance of ‘ varus ' in this
sense. But it corresponds very nearly to
S. iv. 12, “vel eum fallit pede regula
varo.'' It is properly applied to legs that
diver-ge from the knees downwards, and is
opposed to ‘valgus,' bow-legged. See note
on Hor. S. i. 3. 47, “ hunc varum distortis
crnribus.'' ‘Varo Genio,’ therefore, is
Geniuses that go in different directions.
[Jahn has ‘discrepet his,' which is the
MSS. reading. Heinrich has ‘hinc,’
founded on one MS. reading, ‘ hic.’]

19. solie natalibus est qui] ‘Est qui'
is opposed to ‘hic’ (21). On the govern—
ment see Hor. C. i. 1. 3, 11. One moistens
his dry cabbage in ‘ muria‚' which he goes
out to buy for the occasion, and sprinkles
the pepper with his own hand; the other
runs through a large property in good
living while he is still a lad. In both
cases early vice is meant. Like the sons
of Horace's Canusian, Servius Oppidius
(S. ii. 3. 168, sqq.), the one is a cunning
young miser, the other a magnanimous
young spendthrist. ‘Muria' was a saucc
made of the ‘thunuus‚' and less delicate
than ‘garnm,’ which was made of the
‘scomber.' The one was used by the
poor, and the other by the rich. M artial
has an epigram on ¹ muria ' (xiii. 103) :

” “ Antipolitani, fateor, sum filia thunni ;
Essem si scombri, non tibi missa
mmm?

I'tar ego, utar,

But this distinction was not always ob-
served, for Horace speaks of Catius'
choice sance being made of sweet olive
oil mixed with good rich wine and ‘muria'
(S. ii. 4. 65). The stingy lad will let
no one else pepper his mess, like Horace’s
miser, Avidienus (S. ii. 2. 61), “cornu
ipse bilibri Caulibus instillat veteris non
parcus aceti.’' The pepper is called
‘sacred’ for the respect with which he
spares it, as the greedy man spares his
money bags, “congestis undique saccis
Indormis inhians et tanquam parcere
sacris Cogeris '' (Hor. S. i. 1. 70, sqq.
note). ‘Tingat' means that hc only
moistens the cabbage. He is sparing
even of his cheap sance. ‘Irrorat' has
the same sort of force. He spriukles his
pepper but lightly. ‘Empta' means that
he has none in his closet, but must go
out and huy a small cup of the sauce when
he requires it. ‘Magnanimus’ is the
same sort of irony as in Horace’s “Mae-
nius ut, rebus maternis atque paternis
Fortiter absumptis, urbanus coepit ha·
beri'' (Epp. i. 15. 26, sqq.). ‘Bona
dente peragit' is like Juv. xi. 39, sqq„
“aere paterno Ac rebus mersis iu ven-
trem.'' ‘Peragere' is here used as it is
not cxactly used elsewhere. It is ‘ to run
through‚’ as we say, to come to the end
of 1115 property. ‘Puer.’ at the end of

the sentence, is emphatic, as in Horace ,

(C. i. 9. 15), “nec dulces amores Sperne
puer, neque tu choreas,” i.e., while you
are young (Epp. i. 2. 67), “Nunc adhibe
puro Pectore verba, puer.'’

22. Utar eqo, νέως] This is imitated
from Horace, Epp. ii. 2. 190:

“Utar, et ex modico quantum res poscet
acervo

TolIam, nec metuam quid de me judicet
heres.’'

The verb is put absolutely, but the mean-
ing is easily seen. The pronoun though
emphatic is omitted, ⁴ whatever others
may do.‘ He says he will enjoy his for-
tune, which was ample, and yet he is not
on that account so extravagant as to seed
his ‘liberti' upon turbot, or such an
epicure as to distinguish the delicate taste
