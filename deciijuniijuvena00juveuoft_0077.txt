SATIRA ΙΙ.

Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?

Quis caelum terris non misceat et mare eaelo

Si sur displiceat Verri, homicida Miloni,
Clodius accuset moechos, Catilina Cethegum,
In tabulam Sullae si dicant discipuli tres?
Qualis erat nuper tragico pollutus adulter

Forcellini, who explains it of those who in
walking 111-151 111011- legs about like a thong
of leather, or whose legs are naturally dis·
torted. He quotes also Plautus (Poen. iii.
1. 7) : ‘⁸ Nequicquam hos fuscos mihi elegi
loripedes tardissimos.’' The soft word for
50011 appears to have been ‘varus,’ or ‘scau-
rus' (Horace, S. i. 3. 47, n.). The Scho-
liastexplains ‘loripedem' as ‘solutum pedi-
11115 aut curvis?

24. Quis tulerit Gracchos] This might
stand ‘ 51 Gracchi querantur, quis tulerit? ’
· lf the Gracchi were to complain, who would
bear ἥθ’ (See Key's Lat. Gr. 1209.) Every
one will understand the charge of sedition
laid upon the Gracchi (Tiberius and Cajus )‚
the friends of the poor, and feared by the
aristocracy. Itis 001 surprising that their
names passed into proverbs under the em-

ire.

P 25. Quis caelum terris] See below, vi.
283: “clames licet et mare 00010 Confundas
homo snm! He means, who would not
cry out invoking heaven and earth at such
hypocrisy? 05 Stasimus eries out in Plautus
(Triuum. iv. 3. 63) : “ Mare, terra, caelum,
di vostram fidem, Satin’ ego oculis plane
video ?’' The words of Juvenal are bor-
rowed from Vix-gil (Aen. 1*. 790): “maria
omnia caelo miscuit‚’' who, as Grangaeus
remarks, may have got his from Lucretius
(iii. 854): “non si terra mari miscebitur et
mare caelo?

26. Sisalo-displiceat Van-23] That is,if the
plunderer of a province were offended with
0 common robber. ‘ Furtum ’ included all
111οῆ and robbery, with or without violence ;
but where a distinction is meant it is opposed
to ‘ rapina‚’ which is ‘ furtum ’ attended
with force. See note on Hor. S. i. 3.122,

‘Furta latrociniis? Cicero' s seven orations
have made Verres immor-tal 1115· 51010011105
are enshrined in the 110051 specimens of
forensic eloquente that have come down to

1115 name proverbial. Clodius 1105, besides,
insumens for his inti-igue with Caesar’s wife,
Pompeia, and his violation of the mysteries

of ‘ Bona Dea, ' in purs 5011 of his mistress.
Catilinc and Cethegus, 1“0·1*1ο11·10 1115 pir 111015,
are mentioned together again 1111. 2313

01111 next to Lentulus was his chief sup-

rter.

ΙὊ28. Ῑιι tabulam Sullae] The ‘tabula’
means the proscription table or lists of
Sulla; and they who are here called 1115
three disciples are Antonius, Caesar Octa-
vianus, and Lepidus, whose proscription
(AM-C. 711) was inore bloody than Sussa's,
thirty-eight years before. Itis said to have
included 3000 equites and 300 senators, and
among them were Cicero and others of the
first distinction. Lucan calls Cn. Pompeius

a pupil of Sulla (Phars. i. 325) :

“Bella nefanda parat suetus civilibus armis
Et docilis Sullam sceleris vicisse magis-
trum.’'

As to ‘tabulam Sullae' Grangaeus quotes
Florus (iii. 21) ε “ proposita est illa ingens
tabula, et ex ipso equestri ordinis flore ac
senatu duo millia electi qui mori juberen-
tur.’' ‘ Dicere in ² is used in the 501150 of
‘ dicere contra.’ Cicero has “ multa prae-
sens in praesentem et dixerat ct fecerat '’
(Ad Att. xi. 12).

29. Quali-s· erat nuper] He here alludes
to the adulterous intercourse of Domitian
with 1115 niece Julia Sabina, a daughter of
Titus, who was married to Flavius Sabinus,
her father’s and Domitian’s first cousin.
Suetonius (Domit. 22) 1010105 that she was
offered Domitian in marriage while yet a
virgin, and that he refused her because he
was married already to Domitia. But not
long after her marriage (to Sabinus), and
before he came to the throne, he seduced
1101·; and when he was emperor, murdered
her husband on the pretext (mentioned by
Suetonius, c. 10) that when they were pro-
claiined consuls together (am. 82), 1110 year
after Doinitian’s accession, the herald pro-
claimed Sabinus imperatorinstead of consul.
The true reason no doubt was the em-
peror's lust for J ulia ; and Juvenal therefore
calls his connexion with her ‘ tragicus con·
