xx INTRODUCTION.

Then, or soon afterwards, Juvenal was allowed to give up his command Ξ

and return to Rome, being at the time of his return about forty years of ¹

age. Martial’s epigram proves that he was not altogether independent
01· comfortable about this time. Nerva reigned less thau two years, and
Trajan succeeded to the empire ΑΛ). 98, and in the early part of his
reign, soon after ΑᾸ). 100, Juvenal first published a volume of Satires

l
l

(of which the first iu our collection was oue), having already recited them

to large audienccs. It is not unlikely that some of these, or parts of

them, had been composed in the reign of Domitiau¹‚ or even earlier, but

that the poet had not ventured to make them public. He continued to
write frcely during Trajan's reign, which ended A.D. 117, when Juvenal
was about sixty, and during the early years of Hadrian's reign, that is,
till about A.D. 120. During this reign he may have lived in comfort
through the liberality of the emperor, though his household was on a
frugal scale, as he tells us in Sat. xi„ from which (V. 65) we learn that
he had property at Tibur. It is not impossible he may have lived till
the accession of Antoninus Pius, who succeedcd Hadrian A.D. 138, When
Juvenal waS, according to this sketch, eighty or a little more.

Thus the statements of the Grammarians in respect to the poet’s age,
aud of that writer who says he died of old age in the time of Antoninus
Pius, would be borne out. I have also allowed the fact of an honour-
able banishment into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the
Grammarians, which is impossible. That Juvenal did not professedly
compose satire till late in life, is admitted and accounted for. Likewise
that he may have written verses before he ventured to publish them,
and that some of these were afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is
allowed. It is also admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these facts the
Grammarians I believe have been misled, probably by mistaken infer-
ences drawn from allusions in the Satires themselves, a fertile source of
error and of pretended learning on the part of the Scholiasts on all the
ancient authors.

The fact of the banishment, though allowed as not being chronolo-
gically impossible, I nevertheless think is an error, but an early one, as
is proved by a verse quoted from Sidonius ApollinariS, who believed the
whole story, including Paris’ share in it. He wrote about the middle of
the fifth century, and says (Carm. ix. 270, sqq.):

“ Non qui tempore Caesaris secundi
Aeterno coluit Tomos reatu (i. e. Ovid) ;
Nec qui consimili deinde casu,

Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram,
Irati fuit histrionis exul.’'
