D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Inde furor vulgo quod numina vicinorum
Odit uterque locus, quum solos credat habendos

Esse deos quos ipse colit.

Sed tempore sesto

Alterius populi rapienda occasio cunctis

Visa inimicorum primoribus ac ducibus, 110

the N {irnberg (1), and others have Ombos,
for which Achaintre‚ “ solus inter alios in-
terpretes ’⁵ as 110 boastS, substituted Coptos,
and Ruperti follows him. The distance be-
tween the two places is the stumbling-bloek‚
because Juvenal calls them ‘ finitimi? This
will not decide 1110 question, and the read-
ing of the text is probably right. The
Ombites perhaps had nearer neighbours
who despised their crocodile worship, as
those of Elephantine (see note 011 2), but
it is plain from Pliny’s account that the
Tentyrites were the most vigorous anti-
croeodilists, and they may have taken
011 themselves the championship of the
cause.

37. Odit afferque Iocus‚] A true speci-
men of the odium theologicum. ‘ Quum
credat ' is ‘because they suppose.’

38. Sed temporefesto] ‘ Sed ³ is ‘ but to
proceed‚' or ‘ but not to dwell on the eause,’
or any thing of that sort (see xiii. 135, n.‚
and below, v. 51). He goes 011 to tell how
at a festival of the Ombites, when they were
enjoying themselves and drunk, the Ten-
tyrites fell upon them. They came up the
river uo doubt in swarms and took them by
surprise. The chiefs thought it a good occa-
sion to spoil the enemy’s sport. ‘ Ne sen-
tirent‚' &c. is to prevent their enjoying
their holiday, which sometimes lasted seven
days and nights, with tables spread in the
temples and the streets. It was a religious
festival. Juvenal speaks as a Roman when
he says ‘ t0r0.’ A mat would be all be-
tween the man and the bare ground. ‘ Per-
vigili' means that they went on all night,
as he speaks of ‘ pervigiles popinas ² because
they were open all night (viii. 158).

spurious, judging it to be a reflection more
worthy of a cloister philosopher than a
satirist. He gives the credit of this dis-
covery to Francke, ‘his pupil and friend‚'
who has the sanie readiness as his teaeher
in finding monks for what he thinks weak
verses. The subject is spoken of in the
Introduction to this volume in connexion
with the words ‘quantum ipse notavi.’
that is said is that Egypt is rude enough ,-
aud yet in luxurious living the barbarians
do not yield to the infamous Canopus.
Canopus (i. 26, n.) was a seaport at the
mouth of the Canopic branch of the Nile.
It is no contradiction to speak of the bar-
barianS, as he calls them, of Upper Egypt
not yielding to Canopus in profligacy. Ca-
nopus was at this time full of Romans and
other foreigners, and the habits of that place
would not represent those of the Egyptians
in general.

47. Adde quod etfacilis victoria] The
occasion was a good one for annoying the
enemy, and besides this it was one when
they might get a ready victory, while the
Ombites were drenched with wine, 511113101-
ing and tumbling about drunk. ‘Madi-
dus,' ‘ madere,' ‘madens,’ with or without
‘ vin0‚' are common expressions for (11111111-

48. Inde virorum Saltatus] On the one
side there were men dancing to the music
of a blaek flute-player, perfumes (of a cer-
tain sort), flowers, and garlands ; on the
other side (the invading party) nothing but
hatred and an empty belly. It would not
be necessary to explain this if Ruperti had
not in his fashion thrown some doubt upon
the meaning. He says ‘inde ' and ‘hinc’
