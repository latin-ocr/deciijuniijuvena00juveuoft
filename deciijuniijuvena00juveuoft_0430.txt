A. PERSII FLACCI

man (he imagines one) that he knows how
to entertain a parasite and give him a.
shabby cloak when he is eold, and then
ask his opinion, professing to wish for a
candid one. He appears to have remem-
bered Horace, Epp. i. 19. 37. (See v. 45,
above.) Martial has a elever epigram to
Gallicus, who had often asked him for his
candid judgment on his writings (viii.
76) :
“ Ι)10 verum mihi, Marce, dic amabo 3

Nil est quod magis audiam libenter.

Sic et cum recitas tuos libellos,

Et causam quoties agis clientis,

Oras, Gallice, me rogasque semper.

Durum est me tibi quod rogas negare.

Vero verius ergo quid sit audi:

Verum, Gallice, non libenter audis.''

He had another friend whom he calls
Ponticus, equally anxious for his opinion,
and he got his answer (v. 63). Casaubon
observes that Persius has almost copied the
words of the woman 111 Plautus (Mostellaria
i. 3. 24), “ Ego verum 3111ος verum volo
mihi dici 3 mendacem odi.''
56. Quipote? Vis dicam ?]
they Ρ Would you like me to tell you (the
truth)? It is mere nonscnse for you, bald-
head (to write poetry)‚ while you have a foot
and a half of fat paunch sticking out and
hang-ing down before you.” He means he
cannot expect the parasites to tell the truth,
but 'if he likes it 110 will tell it himself. The
emphatic pronoun is omitted again as in v.
23. He calls the man ‘calve-³ It was a
coutemptuous way of speaking it would
seem. ‘ Aqualiculus‚' the Scholiast says,

properly means the paunch of a pig. ‘ Ses-
quipes' is not used in 11115 mdependeut

way elsewhere. It 15 the proverbial mea—
sure for long things. Horace speaks of
“ sesquipedalia verba‚” A. P. 97.

hind his back, as these noble poets were
mocked. ‘ Ciconia ’ means the stretching
the fingers before the 11050 111 the form of
a stork's bill, and pretending to peck at a
man, which is the meaning here of ‘ pinsit?
It was much the same as boys commonly do
now. that follows means putting the
hands to the sides of the head in imitation
of large donkey's ears moving to and fro,
and thrusting out the tongue as far, he says,
as a thirsty dog. white asses were counted
the best, and so were white horses. The
dog is called Apulian because that part of
the country was notoriously dry. See note
on Horace, Epod. iii. 16, “ Siticulosae
Apuliae.” Elsewhere he speaks of “pauper
aquae Daunus '³ (C. iii. 30). ‘ Quantum
sitiat ' is 311 elliptical expression more
easily understood than translated. It
means, ‘ as much as a dog shows when it is
thirsty.' Ovid says (Fast. vi. 123) ‘¹ Stul-
ta ! videt J anus quae post sua terga ge-
rantur.'’ As to ‘imitari mobilisss see Prol.

61. Vos, ο patricius sanyuis,] “ Ye noble
gentlemen, whose fate it is to have no eyes
in the back of your head, beware of the
gibe behind you.'' ‘ Sanna ' is a grimace or
distortion of the mouth. Juvenal uses it
for a sneer (vi. 306). ‘ Occurrite,’ ‘ meet it,'
means they may expect and beware of it.
‘ Fas ' is that which the gods have ordered.

63. Quis populi ser-mo est ? quis enim,]
“ that do 1110 people say of me? Aye
truly, what but this, that now at last verses
have learnt to flow in gentle numbers, so
that the joining of the parts allows the
critical nail to pass over its smooth surfaee.”
The metaphor, as explained on Horace (S. i.
5. 32, “ad unguem Factus homo '’), is taken
from the sculptor passing his ,11311 over his
statue to test the perfect accuracy of the
