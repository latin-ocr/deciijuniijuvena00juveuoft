between ‘libabit’ and ‘libavit’ Some
also have ‘litabit,' and others ‘litai-it:
against the metre. Heinrich prefers the
perfect, ‘liban-it! Madvig, whom Jahn
follows, defends the future (Opusc. ii. 117,
note). Most MSS. and editors favour
‘libabit’ There can be no doubt that
either tense is admissible. Madvig runs
his mles too fine. The perfect would
express a habit. The future expresses the

making the sentence an ironical question.
The MSS. are all in favour of ‘ haud,’ for
which some as usual have ‘liaut.' But
some persons may prefer Heinrich's
reading.

8. Mens bona‚sama‚fides,] ‘Meus bona'
is not what we should call a good beart,
but a good understanding—“ mens sana in
corpore sano ’¹ (Juv. x. 356) ; ‘fama’ is ‘a
good report‚’ and ‘ fides ’ is what we mean
by ‘ credit? The ancients would no more
think of praying for virtuous affections
than we should pray for a handsome face
or an addition to our stature in manhood.
A mau’s virtues and vices they believed
were born with him, and their Genius was
to be thanked or blamed according as their
natural dispositione were bad or good
(Persius iv. 27). In all other matters
their sense of dependence upon the gods
was as wide as that which we profess.

10. Ebulliat patruit-vj Forcellini, who
1188 the old reading ‘ebullit,’ explains it by
‘prodit‚’ in reference to a funeral proees-
sion. The word is not easy to explain,
and is not used elsewhere in any such sense
as here. Heinrich says it is “facit morte
sua ut. funus denique erumpat.¹’ I think
‘ ebulliat’ only means ‘ would breathe his

last? the idea being taken fr0m the bub-
bling of water. (S. iii. 34.) ‘Funus'
need not be taken for the man's funeral,
but for his death, or his corpse. ‘ Ebuuit:
Casaubon's reading, is in manyMSS.; but
it cannot be sustained as 8 subjunctive
form, and the subjunctive is wanted here.
The line that follows is imitated from
Horace (S. ii. 6. 10, and note),

‘¹ O si urnam argenti fors quae mihi mon-
stret, ut illi
Thesauro invento qui mercenarius agrum
Illum ipsum mercatus aravit, dives amico
Hereule.''

‘ Seria' was au earthenware pot, and
corresponds to Horace's ‘urna’ (Persius
iv. 29).

12. quem proximus heres] He speaks
as a ‘ tutor’ or guardian of a minor’s pro-
perty, and as the ‘heres substitutus' or
‘ heres secundo gradu,' whom the testator
appointed to take the property if the
‘heres' forfeited or declined it or died.
(Horace, S. ii. 5. 53, n., “quid prima se-
cundo Cera velit versu.’') ‘ Impello' means
‘ he comes close after him: treads on his
heels. ‘Expungere' here means to erase
his name from the will, and 118 justifies
his prayer as well as his secret hopes by
saying the boy is scrofulous and bilious.

14. Nerio jam tertia conditur aaron]
This is the reading of the oldest MSS.
Most of the later have ‘ducitur,’ which
the modern editors too have adopted.
Either way the man complains that ‘neigh-
bour Nerius‚’ as Brewster has it, is more
lucky than himself, who has only had the
chance of marrying one wife, and secui-ing
oue ‘ dos‚’ as to which see note on Juv. S.
xiv. 220. ‘ Conditur’ has more force per-
haps than ‘ducitur.’ Servius (on Virg.
Georg. iv. 256) is the earliest authority,
