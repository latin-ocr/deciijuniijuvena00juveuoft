D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Vicinos humiles rapere et concidere loris

Exorata solet.

Nam si latratibus alti

415

Rumpuntur somni, “ Fustcs huc ocius,” inquit,
“Affizrtej' atque illis dominum jubet ante feriri,

Deinde canem.

Gravis occursu, teterrima vultu,

Balnea nocte subit ,- conchas et castra moveri

Nocte jubet 3 magno gaudet sudare tumultu,

420

Quum lassata gravi ceciderunt brachia massa,
Callidus et cristae digitos impressit aliptes
Ac summum dominae femur exclamare coegit.
Convivae miseri interea somnoque fameque

Urgentur: tandem illa venit rubicundula, totum

425

Oenophorum sitiens, plena quod tenditur urna
Admotum pedibus, de quo sextarius alter
Ducitur ante cibum rabidam facturus orexin,
Dum redit et loto terram ferit intestino.

lWarmoribus rivi properant, aurata Falernum

430

Pelvis olet: nam sie, tanquam alta in dolia longus

Deciderit serpenS, bibit et vomit.

Ergo maritus

Nauseat atque oculis bilem substringit opertis.
Illa tamen gravior, quae quum discumbere coepit

Laudat Virgilium, periturae ignoscit Elissae,

435

Committit vates et comparat 3 inde llffaronem
Atque alia parte in trutina suspendit Homerum.
Cedunt grammatici, vincuntur rhetores, omnis

‘ Exorata' means though they beg to be
let off. [Ribbeck omits this verse ; and in
v, 415 he has ‘ exertata’ for ‘ cxorata.']
419. Balnea nocte εἰιῦἰές] She goes to
bathe late in the evening, and keeps her
guests waiting for dinner. ‘Conchas' means
the ‘oil-cup’ (see v. 304). ‘Castra mo-
veri ' expresses the fuss she makes, as im-
perious women will. Her preparations for
a bath were like moving a camp. ‘Su-
dare' refers to the vamur-bath, ‘Massa‚'
to (lumb-bells used after bathing. The
woman had a man to rub her dry.
425. tandem illa venit rubicundulcss]
She comes back glowing with her bath, and
calls for wine, ready to drink off a whole
¹ urna,' which was 24 sextarii, or about 12
quarts. Of this she drinks off two pints
(sextarius alter) before (himer, to get up a
ravenous appetite (ὄρεξιν). This is thrown
up again, and with it the contents of her

stomach, dirtying the marble floor, and

disgusting her husband. ‘ Oenophorus ' is
a general name for any wine-vessel. It is
here said to be filled to the brim (tenditur)
with an entire ‘ urna.5 ‘ Admotum pedibus ’
means only that it was put before her3 but
‘ admotum ³ implies that it was large and
heavy. ‘ Dum redit ’ is the reading of nearly
all the MSS. ‘ Cum ' appears in two ac-
cording to Ruperti (Var. Lect.), and it
would seem better suited to the sense.

434. Illa tamen 9ravior‚] He considers
a greater nuisance than any of the fore-
going a cleverwoinan, who gives her opinion
and lays down the law, criticizing the poets
and comparing them so loud and fast that
no one can get in a word. As to ‘ discum-
bere,’ see S. v. 12.

435. periturae iynoseit Elissae‚] She
pities poor Dido, and forgives her faults.
She matches (‘coinmittit,' see i. 163) Vir-
gil and Homer, and puts them in the scales
together. ‘ Trutina ³ was the general name
