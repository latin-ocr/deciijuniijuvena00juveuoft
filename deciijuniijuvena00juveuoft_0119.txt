SATIRA III.

Plurimus hie aeg-er moritur vigilando: sed illum
Languorem peperit cibus imperfectus ct haerens

Ardenti stomacho.
Admittunt?
Inde caput morbi.

Magnis opibus dormitur in Urbe.
Rhedarum transitus arto

Nam quac meritoria somnum

2:35

Vicorum inflexu et stantis convicia mandrae
Eripient somnum Druso vitulisque marinis.

explanation: “aut ad animal retulit quia
sunt in agro quam plurimi aut lacertam
pro horto posuit per quem discurrere et
latitare consuevit.'' The latter seems to be
nearest the meaning. Grangaeus says„ “to
get a place where a single lizard can slecp.’'
Johnson explained it to Boswell by “as
much ground as one may have a chance of
finding a lizard upon.'’ It probably means
as much ground as a lizard would run over,
which, as they seldom go far, would not be
much. Ruperti proposes to substitute ‘ta-
bemae,’ which is feeble enough. Martial
describes the gift of a farm made him by
Lupus in an amusing strain of exaggera·
tion (xi. 18):

“Rus hoc dicere, rus potes vocare?
In quo ruta facit nemus Dianae ς
Argutae tegit ala quod cicadae,
Quod formica die comedit uno.
In quo nec cucumis jacere rectus,
Nec serpens habitare tota possit.''

232. sed illum] This is a sort of paren-
thesis, and meant for another stroke at
town living, where pcople eat all manner of
food and go to bed with it undigestcd. ‘Sed'
is commonly so used. ‘N am' takes up the
sentence from ‘vigilando,' and explains the
reason of that general assertion. ‘ Imper-
fectus’ is undigested and indigestible. ‘Ar-
denti stomacho' is a feverish stomach. I
do not agree with Mr. Mayor, who makes
⁸ nam’ explain ‘ imperfectus ' as if it were
want of sleep that interfered with their
digestion. Indigestion brings on the illness,
and want of sleep kills the patient. ‘ I’lu-
rimus ' does not strictly agree with ‘ aeger,’
which is an adjective. It is used absolutely ς
{many a. man, being sick.’ Horace (C. i.

. 8) has

“—— Plurimus in J unonis honorem

Aptum dicet equis Argos ditesque M ycenas.'’

1 beg therefore to correct the note on that
place where ‘plurimus aeger' is quoted.
[Ribbeck has ‘ sed ipsum.']

234. Nwm quae meritoria] ‘ Meritoria'
are lodgiiigS, and here are equivalent to

the ‘coenacula' mentioned above (v. 166),
though it appears that there was a distinc-
tion. See the passage from L'lpian quoted
in part by Forcellini (hig. 7. l. 13. ξ 8).
“ Si (lomus ususfructus legatus sit, meri-
toria illic facere fructuarius non debet, nce
per coenacula dividere domum. Atquin
locare potest, sed oportebit quasi domum
locarc.'‘ Which means he may let the
whole house to a permanent tenant, but
not lct it out in ‘ meritoria ' or ‘coenacula,'
the former perhaps signifying accommoda-
tion for tmvellers, and the latter seldom or
never being occupied for more than a year.
(Hor. Epp. i. 1. 91, n.)

236. Rlcedarum transitus] As to ‘rheda,'
sec above v. 10. ‘ Stantis convicia mandrae'
is the abuse heaped upon the horscs and
mules kept standing for want of room at the
corners (‘inflexu‚' ⁴ turuing') of the crowded
and narrow streetS. ‘ Mandra’ (μάνδρα) is
properly a stable or other place where ani-
mals are herded3 herc it is applied to the
beasts themselves, because they are huddled
together.

238. Druso vitulisque marinis] By
Drusus some of the commentators sup—
pose is meant the emperor Claudius, whose
cognomen was Drusus, and who is said
by Suetonius usually to have gone to sleep
aster dinner, and to have been naturally
lethargic. It is not impossible his name
may have passed into a proverb ς if not,
it is useless to ask who this Drusus was.
Sea-calves are not lively animals in a me-
nagerie, where Juvenal had probably seen
many ς for every sort of animal was brought
to Rome. The commentators need not have
stumblcd at these words, and Graevius'
alteration into ‘ vetulisque maritis ' is merely
absurd. It appears the Editio Princeps has
(by a corrector's hand) ‘somnos urso,'which
Britannicus adopted and Ruperti approves.
Some MSS. have ⁴ eripiunt.’ The best ap-
pear to have the future, as Horace has ε

 

Non Siculae dapes
Dulcem elaborabunt saporem,
Non avium citharaeque cantus
Somnum reducent.”
