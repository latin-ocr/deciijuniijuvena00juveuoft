may be borne if you stop short of frenzy like Caligula’s, for whom Caesonia mixed her
potent cup—Setting the world on fire, as J uuo might if she sent her husband mad.
Less mischicvous was Agrippina’s mushroom, that sent an aged man head foremostto
his place; the other calls for firc aud sword and torture, mingling patrician and
plebeian blood. Such was the eost of one foal and 000 witch 1

Τ. 627. They hate their husbands' bastards ; which, if 110110 gainsay, then straight to
murder stcpsons is no crime. Beware, boy-S, if you've money trust no mea1; let some
one taste all that your mother gives you. Sure this is all invention, we are trespassing
on tragedy, such as the hills and skies of Latium know nothing of. Would it were
so! But 11010 is Pontia glorying in her guilt. What, viper, kill two children at 0110
supper? “Aye, seven if Ι had them ! '’ We may believe the tragic tales of Procne
and Medea ς they were great monsters in their day, but did it not for money. When
passion hurries them like torrent streams there’s less to wonder at. But she who
calculates ‘the returns and does huge crimes in her right mind, this woman is
uubearablc. They see Alcestis dying for her husband 3 they would invert the case,
aud let their husband die to save their puppy. You’ll meet your Belides and
Eriphylae at the early dawn, and Clytemnestras are in every street. The only differ-
ence is that Tyndarus’ daughter took an awkward hatchet 3 now a toad's lungs will
do the business: but if their lords have taken antidotes, why then the axe shall be

resorted to.

CREDO Pudicitiam Saturno rege moratam

In terris visamque diu, quum frigida parvas

Praeberet spelunca domos ignemque Laremque

Et pecus et dominos communi clauderet umbra;
Silvestrem montana torum quum sterneret uxor 5
Frondibus et culmo vicinarumque ferarum

1. Credo Pudicitiam] Pudicitia was wor-
shipped at Rome under the double form of
patricia and plebeia, and had a temple
under each name, the first in the Forum
Boarium, the other in the Vicus Longus,
She represented coujugal fidelity rather
111311 1111111100 chastity‚ aud her figure on
works of art is that of a matron modestly
clothed (see note on Hor. C. S. 57). Noue
but matrous of respectable character might
sacrifice on her altar.

Saturno reye] Saturnus was according
to tradition the founder of the Latin racc 3
“ tu sanguinis ultimus auctor‚” virgil says,
addressing him (Aen. vii. 49). Flyiug from
Olympus to escape from Jupiter he came to
Latium, which, according to the legend, he
named ‘a latendo,' from the hiding-place
110 found there. In Latium he reigned,
aud taught the nations agriculture and
the arts of peace. His reign is therefore
always referred to as the age of gold,

“ Aurea quae perhibent illo sub rege fuere
Saecula ; sic placida populos in pace re-

11011111.υ (Aen. viii. 324 sqq.)

The Romans identified their Saturn us, whom
as their first ancestor they worshipped, with
the Greek Cronus, and Jupiter with Zeus,
his son. As Cronus was expelled from his
throne by Zeus, so was Saturnus by Jupiter,
who, reiguiug after him, brought in an infe-
rior age, in which the passions of men broke
out for the first time in bloodshed and sen·
suality. Any one can see the confusion of
this story ; but such it is. See Heyne, Exc.
5 on Aen. vii. ; and see below xiii. 28, sqq.
As to the four ages, of gold, sssver, bronze,
and iron, Ovid should be read, Met. i. 89—
150.
