SATIRA V.

419

Apposita intortos extendit reg-ula mores,
Et premitur ratione animus vincique laborat,

Artificemque tuo ducit sub pollice vultum.

40

Tecum etenim long-os memini consumere soles,
Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes,

Unum opus et requiem pariter disponimus ambo,
Atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa.

Non equidem hoc dubites, amborum foedere certo

Consentire dies et ab uno sidere duei :
Nostra vel aequali suspendit tempora Libra
Parca tenax veri, seu nata fidelibus hora

quae sollerter fallit, sed quae sollertiam ad-
hibet, ubi de fallendo agitur, quae non fal-
lit, quod quanquam intelligi potest, inso-
lenter nec hene dictum est.’' Persius says
that when Cornutus took him iu band “the
rule imperceptibly applied straightened his
crooked principles.’' This language is ex·
plained on S. iii. 52, “curvos deprendere
morae,'' and iv. 11.

39. Et premitur ratione animus] Hein-
rich takes ‘ premitur ’ in the sense of prun-
ing. which it bears iu Horace (C. i. 31.
9), “ Fremant Calena falce quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem,'' and other places (see For-
cellini). Jahn explains it differently. He
quotes Virgil (Aen. vi. 80), where Phoebus
is represented as breaking in the Sibyl like
a wild oolt, “fera corda domans fingitque
premendo-’' It probably means no more
than that his mind was brought into sub-
jection by reason. He was anxious (through
the judicious treatment of his master) she
should get the victory over him ; and under
the hand of the philosopher his mind was
shaped into artistic features. This is a.
confusion of metaphors which cannot well
be reconciled. See J uv. vii. 237, “ Exigite
nt mores teneros ceu pollice ducat, Ut si
quis cera vultum facit.” In this place
⁴ artificem‚' which should properly go with
‘ pollice‚' is given to ‘ vultum,’ and so gets
a passive meaning. The subject of ‘ ducit '
is ‘ animus! ‘ Ducere: ‘ to get,' is common
111 a variety of ways. (Juv. xii. 8, 11.)
Forcellini gives instances, and also of ‘ ar·
tifex ’ 111 a passive sense. 'rhat which the
commentators usually quote (Propertius
iii. 29) 118 does not notice, because the
sense is doubtful:

“Atque aram circum steterunt armenta
Myronis,
Quattuor artificis vivida signa boves.”

The MSS. all have ‘ artificis? and it is not
so clear as Mr. l'aley thinks that it stands
for ‘artifices' There is no doubt what
Persius meanS, and the MSS. all have ¹ urti-
ficem.' Casaubon conjectures ‘artificis'

42. epulis decerpere noctem] ‘Decer-
pere ’ here means to ‘ steal away!

43. Unum opus et requiem] virgil has
“ Omnibus una quies operum, labor omni·
bus idem '³ (Georg. iv. 184). ‘ Disponimus '
belongs to ‘ opus' and ⁴ requiem.³ lt may
be translated ‘ we ordered‚' or something of
that sort. The present is used for the
metre’s sake : it refers to past time.

45. Non equidem hoc dubites‚] As to
‘ equidem' see S. i. 110, n. Iu what fol-
lows Persius may have had in mind Ho-
raee’s address to Maecenas (C. ii. 17. 17,
n.) :

“ Seu Libra seu me Scorpios adspicit
Formidolosus, pars violentior
Natalis horae, seu tyrannus
Hesperiae Capricornus undae,
Utrumque nostruin incredibili modo
Consentit astrum. Te Jovis impio
Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit.''

48. Parca tenax veri,] So Horace calls
her “Parca nou mendax? C. ii. 16. 39,
and elsewhere he says the sisters were
“veraces cecinisse Parcae '' (C. S. 25, see
note). Every man‘s Parca attended on
his birth, and went with him through his
life, as his Genius did (ii. 8, n.). and so
they are sometimes spoken of indiscrimi-
natcly. The business of the Parcae was
to execute the decrees (fata) of Jove. Here
the Parca that waited on the birth of
these two friends is stated to have wcighed
their times iu an even balance, and the
honr which first dawued upon them divided
the harmonious destinies of both to them
