Nullane de tantis gregibus tibi digna videtur?
Sit formosa, decens, dives, fecunda, vetustos

naked feet is merc nonsense. The Romans
knew little about the Jewish law, which
however, and particularly the Sabbath, was
held by some of the vulgar in superstitious
respect. (See note on Hor. S. i. 9. 69,
‘ tricesima Sabbata.’)

161. Nullane de tantis] This is supposed
to be another speaker. The answer follows,
which is that there is none 3 for those who
have any merit make so much of it, that
no man should marry them.

163. Porticibus disponat avos,] The
porticoes here meant are the covered gal-
leries with pillars on one side, out of which
doors led to the different roomS. Between
these pillars it was common to set up sta-
tues, as Cicero says to Verres (Act. ii. 1.
c. 19): “ Illa quaero quae apud te nuper
ad omnes columnas, omnibus etiam inter-
columniis, in silva denique disposita sub
divo vidimus ?’' In the ‘atrium,' the prin-
eipal reception room (as we eall it) in a
Roman house, it was usual for the ‘no-
biles’ to set up in rows (disponere) waxen
busts aud pictures (imagines) of such of
their ancestors as had held curule offices or
were otherwise distinguished. According
to this passage such busts and pictures
were set up in the galles-ies. Pietures were
also put up at the public expense in tem-
ples and public porticoes of those who had
earned that honour.

164. bellum dirimente Sabina,] The
story of the Sabine women reconciling their
fathers and brothers with their husbands
is told by Livy (i. 13). ‘Intactus’ is chaste‚
like ‘integer‚’ which has the same root
(tag): “ Notus et integrae Tentator Orion
Dianae '' (Hor. C. iii. 4. 70). “ Sunt qui-
bus unum opus est intactae Palladis urbem
Carmine perpetuo celebrare '’ (C. i. ’7. 5).
Ηο may have copied ‘ intactior ' from Pro-
pertius: “ Tu rapere intactas docuisti im-
pune Sabinas '' (ii. 6. 21). It appears that
some are offended at ‘intactior’ because
they were wives ς and Markland (on Statius,

Silv. ii. 3. 73) proposes ‘sit castior,' a very
unnecessary alteration. ‘ Tangere ' was
used in a bad sense, and ‘intactus’ is
‘ chaste.’ Propertius says, “ Lynceu, tune
meam potuisti tangere curam ?’' (ii. 34.. 9.)

165. nigroque simillima cymam] The
‘ cygnus atratus ' is a native of Australia,
and not found elsewhere. When Juvenal
wrote, therefore, it was unknown, like the
white raven he speaks of in the next satire
(‘corvo quoque rarior albo: v. 202). ‘ Rare
birds ' seems to have been a proverbial way
of speaking. Persius has “quamquain haec
rara avis est ” (i. 46).

166. cui constant omnia?
all virtues meet.”
adorna'’ (Accio).

167. Malo Venusinam] He says he
would rather have a country girl for his
wife than the most virtuous proud woman
in the world, such as Cornelia, the daugh-
ter of the elder Scipio Africanus, wife of
Ti. Sempronius Gracchus, and mother of
the two popular tribunes Tiberius and
Caius Gracchi. Plutarch mentions that at
her death a monument was erected to her
memory with the inscription, ‘ CORNELIA
MATER GRACCHORUM? She lived to a
great age, surviving her sons and also her
son-in-law, Scipio Africanus the Younger,
who married her daughter. She was a
woman of great attainments and strong
mind. The spirit of her sons was inhcrited
from her ς and Cicero says their eloquence
was got from her conversation. He says,
“ Legimus epistolas Corneliae matris Grac-
chorum (this name seems to have been
proverbial) : apparet filios non tam in
gremio educatos quam in sermone matris ’'
(Brut. c. 58). Though her husband and
her sons belonged to the popular party,
Cornelia had the pride of Scipio’s daughter
and the descendant of a long line of ances-
tors. She had also great wealth‚ with
which she lived in princely style. [Ribbeck
has v. 167 thus,
