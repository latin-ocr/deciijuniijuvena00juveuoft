SATIRA Υ Ι. 1 (19

the fault is hers,'' Amphion cries; but Apollo bcnds his bow. So Niobe, with her
mother's pride, destroyed her children and their father too. What ure her dignity and
beauty worth, if she must ever put them in the account? There is no pleusure in
this excellence if pride corrnpts the heart mid makes it bitter. And who is such n
slave ns not to shriuk from her he so extols P

V. 184. There are some fault-², small in themselves, which husbands cannot bear. What

can be more disgusting than to see them affectiug Greek and ignorant of Latin Ρ In
Greek they tell their fears, their wrath, their joys and careS, and all the secrets of
their soul.

V. 200. lf you can’t love the woman you're betrothed to, why should you marry? why
waste a dinner and the bridal presents? If you're uxorious, give your neck to the
yoke. You'll not find one who spares a loving husband. Though she love too, it’s
her delight to torture and to roh the man who loves her. So the best man has least
enjoyment of a wife. You must give, sell, or buy just as she pleases. She sets you
your affections; turus your old friend from your door: and while the vilest make
their wills as they please, you must appoint more than one rival sor your heirs.
“ Take that slave, and hang him.'' “ What has he done? and where's the proof ?
Hear what he has to say. The life of man is sacred, and must not hastily be taken.''
“Fool! is a slave a man? say he's done nothing: it is my will, my order, that's
enough.'’

V. 224. Well, she’s her husband’s tyrant3 but she tires of this and goes to another,
changing her home until her veil’s worn out 3 then she comes back to the bed she
once despised. The number grows—eight husbands in five years! She ought to
have it on her tombstone.

V. 231. No hope of peace while your wife's mother lives 3 she teaches her to rob
you, and how to answer her love letters, corrupts her guards, calls in the doctor
when she's well, only to cover her amours. Yon think, forsooth, a mother ean teach
mor-als better than her orm! BesideS, she finds it to her profit to have a daughter
like herself.

V. 242. Again, therc's scarce a suit in the courts but women move it. Manilia must
be prosecutor if she be not defendant. They write out their own charges, and are
ready to teach Celsus law.

V. 246. who likewise has not seen them in the rug and wrestler’s ointment? or prac-
tising their skill upon a post, going through all their lesson Ρ fit hornblowers at Flora's
feast, except that this is real—that is acting. How can a woman in a helin be. chaste?
She delights in a man's strength, and yet she would not be a man. What a fine
thing when your wife's goods are sold! These are the ladies who perspire in gauze,
and whose sost skin is galled by a silken dress See with what enei-gy she deals her
δῙοννε, with what a weighty helmet on her head, what greaves upon her legs, and
smile when she puts off her arms. Say, O ye noble women, what gladiator’s wife e’er
wore this dress or smote the practising post?

V. 268. At night there is no peace, no sleeping on the marriage bed for broils. She's
like a tiger 3 pretends to cry (though conscious of her guilt the while), complaining of
your boys, or mistress whom she invents ς with tears all ready at command ; and you
believe it love, are pleased‚ and kiss away her tears. Open your fair one’s desk, and
see what letters you would find ! She sleeps with high or low, it's all the same. Now
find me some excuse, Quintilian. “ I cannot.'’ Hear then herself. ‘¹ We always
understood that you should take your way and Ι take mine. Cry ont then, if you
wilh 1 am but woman.'' They’re boldest when they’re caught3 guilt gives them
wrath and courage too.

V. 286. But whence these monstrous crimes P Once were our women chaste, when
poverty and-labour kept them so, and dangers which besct the city. Our ills are
