rest and the Scholiast have ‘ seeretus.’
‘Accersitus’ and ‘arcessitus' have been con-
jectured‚but both arise out of the Scholiast's
error about the doctor. ‘ secretus ’ is awk-
ward after ‘ abditus‚’ and I doubt if it be
the true reading. But the authority for
‘ securus' is too slight, and it might readily
get into the text. Heinrich has it in
his.

The Scholiast says the next verse does
not appear in some MSS. No wonder.
[Ribbeck has ‘salit ' for ‘ pavet.']

240. utile porro] “ Besides it's useful to

the old sinuerto have a daughter as bad as
⁴ herself.'’ She can carry on her gaius through
her.

242. Nulla sere causa est] He says
women mix themselves up with legal pro-
ceedings, and profess to understand law
better than the ablest ‘jurisconsulti‚'among
whom the Celsi, father and son, were eini-
nent about this time. Manilia may be
any body. Juvenal says, if she is not de-
fcmling herself she will turn prosecutor;
she must have one side or the other. ‘ Li-
bellos ’ means ‘libelli accusatorii‚’ written
accusations sent in by the prosecutor to the
praetor. ‘Principium ’ means the ‘exor-
dium libelli,’ and ‘locos' the places from
which arguments are taken. ‘ Dietare ' is a
word proper to teaching, from the masters'
practice of dictating their lessous to boys.
(See Hor. S. i. 10. 75, n.)

246. Endromidas Tyrias] ‘Purple

rugs,' as Holyday sayS. These were worn
when a person was heated. See S. iii. 103.
‘Ceroma ’ is also explained in that satire,
v. 68. ‘ Pali ' is a post on which beginners
training for gladiators practised with a
woodeu swerd and a wicker shield.

249. Alque omnes implet mcmeros‚]
‘Goes through all her course‚' as the
‘lanista ’ directs.

250. Florali matrona luba,] The festi·
val of Flora was celebrated at Rome from
the 28th April till the 2nd May, every

year. It was attended with very lieentious

exhibitions on the stage, women appearing
naked; and Juvenal says this woman gla-
diator was worthy certainly of blowing a
trumpet at the Floralia, except that whereas
the representations there were only acted,
she was prepared to enter the arena in
reality. (See S. i. 22, n.)

255. Quale decus rerum] “ What a fine
thing for you if your wife’s property were
brought to auctiori, her beIt, gauntlets‚
crests, and greavesss' These were worn by
gladiators of different sorts, as may be
seen in the engravings from the bas—relicfs
on the tomb of Scaurus at Pompeii, in
Smith's Dict. Ant„ Art. ⁸ Gladiatores?
Some wore greaves on both legS, others on
only one. “The right arm is covered, the
left carries au oblong shield. ‘Manicae,' as
worn by gladiators, are sleeves which co-
vered the whole of the right arm and hand.
‘Balteus ' was a swerd-belt worn round the
