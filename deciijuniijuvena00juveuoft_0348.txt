Imperium, aut Sicula torvus cum conjuge Pluton3

D. J UNII J UVENALIS

Nec rota, nec Furiae, nec saxum aut vulturis atri
Poena 3 scd infernis hilares sine regibus umbrae.
Improbitas illo fuit admirabilis aevo,

Credebant hoc grande nefas et morte piandum,

Si juvenis vetulo non assurrexerat et si

Plura domi fraga et majores glandis acervos.
Tam venerabile erat praecedere quatuor annis,
Primaque par adeo sacrae lanugo senectae !

regions, quoting after Grangaeus Horace’s
“tristia regna '' (C. iii. 4. 46). ‘Triste’
does very well for the sea, which the
Romans had a great dread of, as we saw
in the last satire. Pluto carried off his
wife Proserpina from Sicily. The wheel
is Ixion’s, the stone that of SisypliuS‚ the
vulture the bird that ate the liver of
Tityos. “Incontinentis nec Tityi jecur
Reliquit ales'' (Hor. C. iii. 4. 77). [Ribbeck
has ‘haud’ for ‘aut.']

54. Credebant hoc grande nefas] The
law of Moses contained this precept,
“ Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head
and honour the face of 311 01(1 111311” (Levit.
xix. 32). Ovid tells us as 3 feature of the
good old times

“Magna fuit quondam capitis reverentia
cani,
Inque 5110 915110 ruga senilis erat,'’

and more to the same purpose (Fasti v. 57,
sqq.). The story of the old man in the
theatro at Athens to whom the Lacedae-
monian strangers rose up and offered him
the seat he could not get from 1115 own
eountrymen is familiar to most readers.
Cicero (de Senect. c. 18) and Valer. Max.
(iv. 5. 2, ext.) 1156 11 to illustrate the sub-
ject Juvenal is speaking of. His words
have been imitated by our own poets (see
Gifford's note). A. Gellius says that
among the earliest Romans age was 111016
1·5595615(1 111311 rank or money, and that
old men were honoured like gods or pa-
rents: in every situation and office they
had precedence3 they were allowed the
first place at table, and they were attended
by their juniors when they went abroad3
which habit they derived from the Lace-
daemonians. But this revel-enee for age
gave way before the necessities of the
state, which required that encourage-
ment should be given to younger men that

60

they might marry and get children (N. A.
ii. 15). [Ribbeck and Jahn have a comma
after ‘acvo,' and read in the next line
‘Credebant quo? ‘Quo' is the reading
of P.; ‘quod' of many MSS„ and ‘hoc’
of some of the more recent.

After v. 59 Ribbeck has inserted vv. 28
—3o‚ with the feeble reading ‘N unc aetas.’]

56. Barbato cuicunque paen] ‘Puer-
itia’ ceased with the taking of the toga
virilis about fourteen or fifteen. Respect
for seniority was carried so far, he says,
that 3 boy showed quite as much (par
adeo) reverence for a youth not more than
four years older than himself who had but

just begun to show his early down, as for

old age itself. It was usual to shave off
the beard at about twenty-one, as stated
on S. vi. 214. The next line 11163115,
though he lived in a richer house than the
other. Wild strawberries (fraga) and
mast were food for primitive times, and
the consequence of the house is measured
by the quantity of food stored for its con-
sumption. As to ‘cuicunque’ see below,
v. 89, n. The different sorts of ‘ glandes'
are discussed by Pliny (H. N. xvi. 5, 6).

60. Nunc si depositum] See above, v.
16, 11. He has just said that in former
days the utmost reverence was paid to
age, but now honesty is a portentous
thing: he means 111611 that such reverence
was proof of an honest and single mind.
⁴ Follis ’ is here used for 3, money-bag, as
in xiv. 281, and Plaut. Aulul. ii. 4. 23:
“follem obstringit ob gulam.'' It seems
to have been commonly used in this way
in later times, and as equivalent to money
itself, as in Eastern countries a purse is a
certain sum. See examples in Forcellini,
English edition. ‘Aerugo' is for ‘aeS,'
contemptuously, the rust for the copper-
Horace, A. P. 330, speaks of “aerugo et
cura peculi.'’
