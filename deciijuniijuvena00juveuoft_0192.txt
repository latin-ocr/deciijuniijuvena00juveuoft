Sperare et fidibus promittere.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid faceret plus

Aeg-rotante viro, medicis quid tristibus erga

Filiolum ’ἓ

Stetit ante aram, nec turpe putavit

Pro cithara velare caput, dictataque verba
Pertulit ut mos est, et aperta palluit agna.
Dic mihi nunc quaeso, dic, antiquissime Divum,

Respondes his, J ane pater?

Non est, ut video, non est quod agatur apud vos,

Haec de comoedis te consulit ; illa tragoedum
Commendare volet ε varicosus fiet haruspex.

Sed cantet potius quam totam pervolet urbem
Audax et coetus possit quam ferre virorum

Cumque paludatis ducibus praesente marito

Magna otia caeli :

Ipsa loqui reeta facie strictisque mamillis.
Haec eadem novit quid toto fiat in orbe ;

Graece Latineque; ac praeter citharoedos
chorocitharistae quoque et psilocitharistae.'’
The crown was of oak leaves. So Martial
says (iv. 54) ι

“O cui Tarpeias licuit contingere quercus,
Et meritas prima cingere fronde comaS.’'

These games which Nero celebrated, though
perhaps Domitian first instituted them as a
regular quinqueunial practice, were con-
tinued to a late period of the Empire.
Martia] attributes them to Domitian :

“Pro Capitolinis quid enim tibi solvere

templis,
Quid pro Tarpeiae frondis honore po-
test ?'' (ix. 4.)

Pollio is mentioned in the next Satire, v.

176. It was the name of a living musi-

cian, for Martial mentions him. ‘ Sperare

et fidibus promittere‚' is like Lucan, vii.

758:

“Cum sibi Tarpeias victor desponderit
arces,

Cum spe Romanae promiserit omnia

praedae.”

391. Pro cithara velare eaput‚] “ For a
mere player to put on the veil‚'’ the usual
custom in sacrifices. The priest in attend-
ance recited the usual form of prayer (car-

men) and the suppliant repeated it after.

him. ‘ Pertulit' meam, as Heinrich says,
repeats these tedious formulae with all pa-
tience froin beginning to end. ‘Aperta
palluit agna ’ expresses her anxiety as she
looks into the entrails of the lamb, and
expects the declaration of the haruspex.

393. antiquissime Divum,] See the note
on Horace, S. ii. 6. 20, referred to on v.
385. ‘ Antiquissimus’ here is ‘foremost.'
“Unde homines operum primos vitaeque
labores Instituunt'' (Hor. 1. 0.).

394. Μαφια otia caeli s] Horace, copy-
ing Lucretius, says (S. i. 5. 101):

“ ——— namque deos didici securum
agere aevum 3
Nec, si quid miri faciat natura, deos id
Tristes ex alto caeli demittere tecto.”

Juvenal says the haruspex will get varicose
veins in his legs with standing about so
much iu attendance on these women.

398. Sed cantet potius] The next cha-
racter is that of a bold masculine? woman
who thrusts herself into the company and
business of men; a busybody who knows
every one’s affairs; a gossip who is fami-
liar with all the news, running about the
town to pick up the last reportS. [Ribbeck
omits from the text vv. 398—412. In
v. 399 he and Jahn have ‘quae’ for
‘qnam.’

400. galzcdaiis ducibus] sse ‘paluda-
mentum' was a cloak worn by superior
officers. It was loosely tin-own over one
shoulder, aud fastened with a clasp over
the other, so as always to leave one arm
bare, or it fell over the back, the clasp
shifting round to the throat, as in the
figures given in Smith's Dict. Ant. sub
verb. (See Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 13, ‘quum
paludatus exeipit,’ Long's note.) ‘Strictis
mamillis ’ Heinrich explains, ‘ exstantibus,
nudis‚' ‘mit unbedecktem Busen.' “E
sinu exsertis et patentibus. Sic dicimus
