Sed defluit actas

Et pelag-i patiens et cassidis atque ligonis.
Taedia tunc subeunt animm, tunc seque suamque

Terpsichoren odit facunda et nuda senectus.

Accipe nunc. artes ne quid tibi conferat iste
Quem colis et Musarum et Apollinis aede relicta.
Ipse facit versus atque uni cedit Homero
Propter mille annos; et si dulcedine famae

Suc-census recites maculosas commodat aedes.

sertos' here means poets, who arc also
called ⁴ docti' &doctarum hederae praemia
frontium,'' Hor. C. i. 1. 29. “Scribimus
indocti doctique poemata passim,'’ Epp. ii.
1. 117) like the Greek σοφοί. ‘ Disertus’
properly applies to oratory. Cicero defines
its meaning (de Orat. i. 21) as opposed to
‘ el uens.'

ἕξ. Sed defluit aetas] See Argument.

36. Accipe nunc artes] He goes on to
show how the patron compromises with the
poet by giving help that costs nothing.
There wns a temple called Herculis Mu-
sarum, built by Fulvius Nobilior about
A.U.c. 575 ; and restored by Marcius Phi-
lippus, stepfather of Augustus, after whom
it was called Porticus Philippi. The tem-
ple of Apollo Juvenal refers to is that on
the Palatine, built by Augustus 26th Octo-
ber, B.c. 28, to commemorate his victory
at Actium (see Introduction to Hor. C. i.
31: ‘⁴ Quid dedicatum poscit Apollinem
Vates?'’)‚ and to which he attached the
librar-y referred to on v. 29. The poets
recited their compositions in the porticoes
attached to the temples, as shown 'm the
note on Horace, S. i. 10. 38; “ Quae neque
in aede sonent certantia judice Tarpa.'’
Juvenal says these misguided poets left
the usual places of recit-ation to accept of
a shabby patron a dirty room and a packed
audience. In Horace's time the public
censor of plays heard them rchearsed in the
porticoes, as appears in the place just
quoted. There also it is probable the em-
peror sometimes himself heard poets, or
set persons to hear and report to him.
Jahn [aud Ribbeck] follow Madvig in put-
ting the full stop after ‘artes’ and a comma
at ‘relicta' I think ‘ artes' was not intended
to stand by itself; it is ‘ artes ne quid tibi
conferat iste? According to the other punc-
tuation it would appear that the man wrote
verses to avoid giving money to the poet.

38. Ipse facit versu-⁹] This scurvy pa·

tron himself affects to be a poet inferior to
Homer only for thc reverencc due to his
antiquity 5 and to show that he has a poet's
sympathies he lends his poor brother a
dirty room, which had long been locked
up as fast as the gates of a town when the
enemy is coming. He also gives him a
few of his dependants to sit at the end of
the room, and in different parts to applaud
him; but he leaves him to go to the
'expense of hiring his own bcnches aud of
the porterage. For ‘ maculosas’ the MSS.
have Maculonis or Maculonus, which the
older editors and Achaintre have adopted
as the name of the patron. The Scholiast
has a note which is corrupt, and has been
variously mended, ‘⁶ Succensus R. M.: alii
sordibus dixit, alii pictas.” ‘ Sordibus ' was
probably ‘sordidae’ from which Heinrich
conjectures the word ‘maculosas ’ for Ma-
culonis. ‘ Maculatas ' had before been
suggested by Schurzfleisch (Spicsseghxm,
ΛΑ). 1717), and Jahn quotes one Paris
MS. of the tenth century which has ‘ ma-
culosos.5 There can be no doubt of the
true reading. Heinrich explains it of cob-
webs, and alters the Scholiast's ‘ dixit ’ to
‘ textis ’ to represent that meaning.

39. Propter mille annos ;] The Scholiast
has a note, which must be taken for what it
is worth : “ Fuit Homerus annis ante urbem
conditam centum LX, post Ilium captum
ducentis Lx.'’ He therefore supposed Homer
to have lived at the end of the tenth cen-
tury before Christ, and the Trojan War to
have happened B.c. 1173. Porphyrion puts
Homer 275 years after the Trojan War,
and the Parian Marble 277. The Scholiast
therefore was nearer to them than any of
the other computations. But his autho·
rity is not worth much.

41. Haec Ionyeserrata] The interpre-
ters properly explain ‘longe ’ as ‘diu.’
Forcellini gives plenty of examples ; which
Mr. Mayor seems not to have noticed, for
