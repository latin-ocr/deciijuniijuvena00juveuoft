D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Cogitat heredem, cariturus turture magno

Mullorumque jubis et captatore macello.

40

Quid fieri non posse putcs si jungitur ulla
Ursidio? si moechorum notissimus olim
Stulta maritali jam porrigit ora capistro,
Quem toties texit perituri cista Latini?

Quid, quod et antiquis uxor de moribus illi
O medici, mediam pertundite venam !

Quaeritur.

45

Delicias hominis! Tarpeium limen adora
Pronus et auratam J unoni caede juvencam,
Si tibi contigerit capitis matrona pudici.

Paucae adeo Cereris vittas contingere dignae

to rear, and leaving others to be exposed
and destroyed.

[Between lines 37 and 38 Ribbeck has
interposed near eighty lines from other
parts of this satire, in which women's
vices are satirized. In fact by many
transpositions and some omissions, he
has so changed the common text that
it is not possible to explain to a reader
what he has done. Those who would know,
must compare his text of this satire with
the common texts.]

39. cariturus turture magno] If he gets
children, he must not expect to receive
presents, fine pigeonS, bearded mullets, and
other contents of the market, which is
called ‘ captat0r‚’ the fortune-hunting mar-
ket, because fortune-hunters bought the
best things to send to their victims. A
good deal was said on this subject in the
last satire. About mullets see iv. 15, n.

42. olim] This contains the root ‘ ol' of
‘olle' or ‘ille‚’ and is an adverb of time,
signifying any that is not present. Here
it means in former times, ‘Jam' is ‘at
length.'

43. porrigit ονα capistro,] ‘ Capistrum ³
is a halter or headband of any sort, or a
rope (generally of twisted osiers or other
twigs) by which oxen were fastened to the
yoke.

44. perituri cista Latini ἲ] This is ex-
plained by Horace, S. ii. 7. 59:

“ ———— an turpi clausus in arca,
Quo te demisit peccati conscia herilis,
Contractum genibus tangas caput ?”

Why the chest into which the adulterer was
‘thrust should be called, “perituri cista
Latini '' may be seen from the scholium
quoted on S. i. 36. Heinrich prefers the
reading of one MS.. ‘periturum‚' which

50

he explains, ‘ut paene perisset? But as
Latinus was put to death, ‘perituri' will do.
The participle in ‘ urus ' signifies usuallyiu-
tention or destiny (see Key's L. Gr. §§ ¹702,
1268). Here ‘ perituri ' would mean, who
was destined at last to pay the penalty of
his lewdness. See v. 39, ‘ cariturus tur-
ture?

45. Quid, quod et antiquis] This is a
step farther, not only that he should want
to marry, but also think of getting a wife
such as those of the olden time. ‘ Quid’ is
commonly used thus to introduce a new
case or illustration. Sometimes it has
‘ enim ' after it. It should not have a note
of interrogation. See notes on Hor. C. ii.
18. 23; S. i. 1. 7.

46. mediam pertundite venam Ι] He

recommends the doctors to bleed him for ‚

madness. Holyday has a note on ‘media
vena‚’ which he shows from Paulus Aegineta
(lib. iii. De Phreneticis) to bein the forehead.
Jahn [and Ribbeck] from P. and three
other MSS. of the ninth and tenth cen-
turies, edit ‘ nimiam? This reads very like
a copyist‘s invention. P. has ‘ mediam '
by a later hand, and all other MSS. and
editions have that word.

47. Delicias hominis J] ‘A pretty fellowl’
(see xiii. 140). He bids him go and sacri-
fice a thank-offering to J uno Pronuba, at
her temple on the Capitol, and bow down
and kiss her threshold, if he has succeeded
in getting a chaste wife. J uno's temple was
at one end of that of Jupiter Opt. Max„ as
Minerva's was at the other. Mons Capito-
linus was originally called Saturnius, and
afterwards Tarpeius. ‘Aurata juvenea’ is
a calf with her horns gilt, which was not
an uncommon sacrifice.

50. Cereris vittas] virgil seems to be
imitated here, Aen. ii. 167,—
