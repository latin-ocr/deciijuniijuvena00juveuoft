Vatibus occurras, periturae parcere chartae.

must bespoilt, mercy would bc thrown away:
1 may as well spoil it as others.’' [The verse
‘Exspectes..p0eta ’ is rejected by Ribbeck,
following thesuggestion of Debree.] School·
boys will not want to be told what ‘manum
ferulae subducere’ means; but it appears
the commentators are not agreed. It cor-
respondsto Horace’s“didicit prius extimuit-
quc magistrum '' (A. P. 415). Grangaeus
quotes several authorities for the expression,
which into a proverb.

16. Consilium dedimus Sullae] Jahn on
the authority of many of the MSS. writes
‘ Syllae ς’ but all inscriptions where the name
occurs have ‘ Sula’ or ‘Sullae The Greek
form is Σύλλας. The theme on which he
professes to have declaimed belongs to the
order called “suasoriae orationes,'' of which
a book was written by the elder Seneca. It
appears to have been a savourite subject.
Quintilian says (Inst. iii. 8), ‘⁴ neque enim
ignoro plerumque exercitationis gratia poni
et poeticas et historicas, ut Priami rerba
apud Achillem,aut Sullae clietaluramdepo-
nentis in contione? The advice is, that
Sulla should purchase sleep by laying
down his power. He did so, Β. c. 79, and
died next year in retirement. ‘ Suasoriae '
were distinguished from ‘ controversiae?
and belonged rather to boys’ schools. See
note on Pers. iii. 45.

20. Auruncae-flexit alumnus] Suessa, in
Campania, the later capital of the Aurunci,
whose original town Aurunca. (five miles
from Suessa) was destroyed by the Sidicini
( Livy viii. 15), was called Suessa Aurunca,
to distinguish it from Suessa Pometia, an
Alban colony in Latium, from which the
Pomptine marshes were named. Suessa
Aurunca was the birth-place of Lucilius.

21. Si vacat et] On the authority of
P. which has ‘ si placat ac‚’ Jahn has adop-
-ted ‘ac.' All other MSS. and editions have
‘et’ [except Ribbeck, who has ‘ ποῖ]

22. Mam-ia Tuscum Ffiqat aprum] This
refers to the ‘ venationes‚' or figlits with wild
beasts at the circus and amphitheatres. The
beasts fought with each other, or with rnen
trained for the purposeand called ‘ bestiarii.’
Of these many were free meu and volun-
teers fighting for pay, and among them were
sometimes found even women (see ii. 53),
which seems to have happened first in the
year ΑΛ). 63, iu the reign of Nero. “ Spec-
tacula gladiatorum idem annus habuit pari
magnificentia ac priora: sed faeminarum
illustrium senatorumque plures per arenam
foedati sunt.” (Tac. Aun. xv. 32.) Sueto-
nius mentions the magnificent games of
Domitian: “ Spectacula magnifica assidue et
sumptuosa edidit—venationes gladiatores-
que—nec virorum inodo pugnas sed etfaemi-
narmn.” Juvenal refers to them again (S. vi.
246, sq.) aud his contemporary, Statius,
does the same, Silv. i. 6. 53, sqq. :

“ Stat sexus rudis insciusque ferri,
Et pugnas capit improbus viriles.
Credas ad Tanain ferumve Phasin
Thermodontiaeas calere turmas.’'

The practice was put down more than a
century later by a senatusconsultum, in the
reign of Sept. Severus The bours of Etru-
ria were particularly large. Lucania and
Umbria were also famous for these beasts
(Hor. S. ii. 3. 234, n.). The women are
said to hunt with their breasts bare like the
Amazons, to whom they are likened by Sta-
tius in the above extract. M. and many
other MSS. have Nevia sor Maevia. Martial
has the former name.

25. Quo tondente] There wns a barber,
Licinus, mentioned by Horace (A. P. 301).
ofwhom the Scholiast there says that he was
made a senator by C. Julius Caesar. There
appears to have been some such story con-
nected with a low man of this name, for it
passed into a proverb. It may or may not
