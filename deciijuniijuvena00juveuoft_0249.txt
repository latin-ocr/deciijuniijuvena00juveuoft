SATIRA Y 11 1.

199

Exspectata diu tandem provincia quum tc
Rectorem accipiet, pone irae fraena modumque,
Pone et avaritiae, miserere inopum sociorum;

Ossa vides regum vacuis exsucta medullis

90

Respice quid moneant leges, quid curia mandet,

Praemia quanta bonos maneant, quam fulmine justo
Et Capito et Numitor ruerint damnante Senatu,

Piratae Cilicum.

Sed quid danmatio confert,
Quum Pansa eripiat quidquid tibi Natta reliquit?

Praeconem, Chaerippo, tuis circumspice pannis,
Jamque tace : fin-or est post omnia perdere naulum.
Non idem gemitus olim neque vulnus erat par
Damnorum sociis florentibus et modo victis.

Plena domus tunc omnis, et ingens stabat acervus

referred to by Martial. ‘Aeno' is the vessel
in which he prepared his pei-fumes. ‘ Toto
mergatur aeuo ' is the same as ⁶ totus iner-
gatur‚’ ‘though he be plunged head over
ears in Cosmus’ copper.' The commenta-
hirs and translators talk of a perfumed hip-

term ‘ socii ’ was applied to all the subjects
and tributaries of Rome, natives ofcountries
beyond the liinits of Italy. All other
foreign nations were ‘exterae nationes!
See Long’s notes 011 Cic. in Verr. Act. ii.
lib. 4. c. 11, “ apud socios et exteras na-
tiones? and on Divin. in Q. Caecilium, c.
3, Vol. 1„ “Populzttae, vexatae, funditus
eversae provinciae : socii stipendiariique
populi Romani afflicti.” By ‘regum’ he
means native princes, who were allowed to
retain the title with no power, and whom
the Roman governors drained, leaving them
without authority or money, like bones with
the marrow extracted. There have been
many such ‘ reges ’ iu India since the
British rule has been established there.
Heinrich says ‘socii' are not the ‘pro-
vinciales i’ but he is clearly wrong. ‘ Ex-
sucta’ or ‘exucta' is not the reading of

y many Mss.; but it is that of the best.

Others are either false copies 01· glosscs.
91. quid curia mandet,] The governors
of the senatorial provinces, like those of the
imperial, received their instructions from
the emperor by ‘ rescripta? But their ap-
pointment was nominally in the senate,
whose authority they were supposed to re-
present. Cossutianus Capito was appointed

governor of Cilicia in the year Λα). 56. Next
year he was charged by the provincials with
extortion and degi-aded. But he recovered
his senatorial rank through the intluence of
Tigellinus (i. 155, n.)‚ his father-in-law
(Tac. Ann. xi. 6, Sne..) Numitor is un-
known. One of that name is mentioned
above, vii. 74. He may have been quaestor
to Capito. He calls them pirates of the
Cilicians, perhaps because those people had
been themselves notorious pirates. He
says the condemnation of these governors
was of 110 use (they were ‘ damnati inani
judicio,' i. 47) it' 115 50011 as one robber goes
another comes. The names Pansa and
Natta as governors of provinces are un-
known. ‘Tibi' means any provincial;
Chaerippus, for instance, whom he advises
to look out for a ‘ pracco’ to 5011 1115 tat-
tered clothes (all he ’11115 left), and then
hold his tongue‚ and not think of wasting
his money by coming to Rome to com-
plain, which he expresses by saying it is
mere madncss, after all he has lost, to
throw away the eost of a voyage. ‘ N au-
luin,' which is borrowed from the Greek
(ναῦλον), is found in the law writers. It
is the fare.

95. Quum Pansa, effen] [Jahn and Rib-
beck place a note of interrogation after
‘ confert,' and put v. 96 before v. 95.]

98. Non idem gemitus] He says the
provincials suffered less from conquest than
they suffered afterwards from their go-
vernors. The conquerors left them their
money and other property. The ‘ chlamys '
was 11 light shawl worn by the Greeks, and
