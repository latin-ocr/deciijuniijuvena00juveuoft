D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Aequora transiliet, sed longe Calpe relicta

Audiet Herculeo stridentem gurgite solem.

280

Grande operae pretium est ut tenso folle reverti
Inde domum possis, tumidaque superbus aluta
Oceani monstra ct juvenes vidisse marinos.

Non unus mentes agitat furor.
In manibus vultu Eumenidum terretur et igni,

Ille sororis
285

Hie bove percusso mugire Agamemnona credit
Aut Ithacum. Pareat tunicis lieet atque lacernis,
Curatoris eget qui navem mercibus implet

Ad summum latus et tabula distinguitur unda,

Quum sit eausa mali tanti et discriminis hujus

290

Concisum argentum in titulos faciesque minutas

Occurrunt nubes et fulgura ;

‘¹ Solvite funem‚’'

Frumenti dominus clamat piperisve coempti ς
“ Nil color hie caeli, nil fascia nigra minatur 3

281. Grande operae pretium] This is a
common expression. See ix. 28, xii. 127,
and vi. 474, n. As to ‘follis' see xiii. 61,
n. ‘Aluta’ is prepared leather. In vii.
192 it is used for a shoe. Here it means
a leathern purse and ‘tumida' like ‘ tenso’
means that it is well filled. The name is
from ‘alumen’ (alum), in which it was
steeped to soften it. So we are told in
Dict. Ant„ art. ‘ Calceus.5 ‘ J uvenes ma-
rinos’ the Scholiast explains to bc the
Tritons and Nereids, Heinrich “ the young
gentlemen and ladies of the sea.'’ Horace
asks,

“Quem mortis timuit gradum
Qui siccis oculis monstra natantia,

Qui vidit mare turgidum ‘?''
(C. i. 3. 17.)

284. Non unus mentes ayz'tat furora]
He goes back to what he said in v. 136,
that avarice is madness. Some are mad
one way and some another. Orestes was
driven mad by the Erinnyes of his mother,
and Ajax was mad when he flogged the
beasts and thought he was listening to the
eries of Agamemnon and Ulysses. The
allusion in the first case is to a scene in the
Orestes of Euripides (v. 266, sqq.) where
he becomes suddenly wild and eries,

Za Φοῖβ’, ἀποκτενοῦσί μ’ αἴ κυνώπιδες,
γοργῶπες, ἐνέρων ἱερίαι, δειναὶ θεαί,

and his sister Electra, who has hcr arms
round him, answers,

οὔτοι μεθήσω· χεῖρα δ’ ἐμπλέξασ’ ἐμὴν
σχήσω σε πηδᾶν δυστυχῆ πηδήματα.

The second case is taken from the second
scene of Sophocles’ play of Ajax.

287. Pareat tunicis licet atque lacernis‚]
Though he does not tear his clothes, the
man is mad and wants a guardian who
tempts the sea for gain. As to ‘lacerna'
see S. i. 27, n. ⁶ Curator ' is the technical
name for the guardian of an insane person.
He was chosen by the praetor from among·
the ‘ agnati’ (relations in the male line) of
the patient. See note on Hor. S. ii. 3.
217: “interdicto huic omne adimat jus
Praetor et ad sanos abeat tutela pro-
pinquos.’' As to ‘ tabula distinguitur
unda ’ see S. xii. 58. Η6 describes money
as silver engraved with inscriptions and
miniatures. ¹

290. hujus] ‘ such as this? See xiii.
103, n. ·

293. piperisve coempti ;] The ancients
got their pepper from India probably
through Syria. P. and other MSS. have
‘ve3’ other MSS. have ‘que.’ It does not
much matter, though ‘ ve' may be more
accurate. Corn and pepper need not be
supposed to form the same cargo, even if
we have ‘ que,' which Heinrich has.

294. nil-foscia m'yra minatum] ‘Fascia'
is a bandage (see S. vi. 263; ix. 14), and the
Scholiast explains it here as “ nubes dueta
per caelum.” It is nowhere else used in
any such sense, but it is easily understood.
