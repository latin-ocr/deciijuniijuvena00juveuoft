‘ miseri' and ‘ gemuere! The first Hein-
rich adopts. In 65, on the other hand,
¹ miseris ' has been changed to ‘ seris.'
These shades of taste are not safe guidcs.
We had better follow the MSS.

64. Fruge Cleanthem] Cleanthes was the
most devoted disciple and the successor of
Zeno, the founder of the Stoics. (J uv. S.
ii. 7, n.) Horace has “ purgatam aurem ’¹
and “Auriculas collecta sorde. dolentes ''
(Epp. i. 1. 7, 2. 53). Below we hear of the
Stoic cleaning his cars with an infusion of
vinegar. The ears being kept clean means
that the man is wide awake‚ attentivc, ready
for observation or instruction. As to
⁸ finem ' see S. i. 48, 11. ‘ Viatica ' is pro-
vision of au sorts for a journey, and he
calls on young and old to get from the
fruits of wisdom provision for the journey
of life when it is drawing to its close.
‘Canis,' ⁴ 11031· 113115,’ is used as a substan-
tive. ‘ Miseris,' the reading of the MSS„
Heinrich changes to ‘ scris,’ an emendation
of Markland for which there is no necessity.
See last note. He follows up his advice
by bidding them not to put off this provision
till the morrow, for that inorrow will always
have another, and as the hinder wheel can
never overtake the front, though it runs so
near, so procrastination faiis to reach the
mori-ow 011 which its work is to bc (lone,
though it is but 3, day 111 advance. ¹ Can-
thus’ is the felly or iron circuinference of
the whcel, but is here put for the whecl

itself, as ‘temo‚’ the pole, is put for the
carriage. Persius is the earliest author that
11505 1110 word ‘ canthus.’ Quintilian (Inst.
i. 5. 8) speaks of his using it us a received
word, though in fact it wasa barbarism got
from the African or Spanish language. Ca-
saubon shows that it is Greek.

68. Jam era-s· hesternum consumpsimus ,ἦ
Because in some of the MSS. of Servius on
Virg. v. 19, ‘ heu ’ is inserted before ‘ con-
sumpsimus,' Heinrich adopts it, and Ca-
saubon says the addition gives pathos to
the line. 1 do not think much of the
pathos derived from cx1)letIx·cs‚a11‹l none
of the MSS. have ‘heu.’ Priscian also
quotes the verse without ‘heu ’ (xviii. 30).
‘ Hos annos ’ is ‘ the present monient,' to-
day. He sayS‚ ‘Another to·morrow will
have driven away to-day‚ and the time for
3011011 will always be 3 little further on.'

73. Libertate opus esl,] According to the
Stoics only the sage was a free 111311 (Hor.
S. ii. 7. 83, “ Quisnam igitur liber ἶ) Sa.-
piens‚ sibi qni imperiosus ''), and such
liberty, Persius goes on to say, every man
should scek, for that is not liberty which is
given to a slave at his manumission. The
reading of the text is that of many MSS.
Most of the editions have ‘ut' with or
without ‘qua.' ‘Ut' is not wanted if
‘quisque ' he taken sor ί(]11101111(μιο,’ of
which there 310 several examples in Plautus
given by Forccllini. The sense is ‘ we must
have liberty; not that in virtue of which
