3:36

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Monstro voluptatem egregiam cui nulla theatra,
Nulla aequare queas Praetoris pulpita lauti,
Si spectes quanto capitis discrimine constent
Incrementa domus, aerata multus in arca

Fiscus et ad vigilem ponendi Castora nummi,

260

Ex quo hlars Ultor galcam quoque perdidit et res

Non potuit servare suas,

Ergo omnia Florae

Et Cereris licet et Cybeles aulaea relinquas 3
Tanto majores humana negotia ludi.

An magis oblectant animum jactata petauro

265

Corpora quique solet rectum descendere funem,
Quam tu Corycia semper qui puppe moraris

The army abandoned the king and sup-
ported his son, which led Mithridates to
destroy himself. Whether Juvenal had
this in mind or not 1 am not sure. What
he says amounts to this, that fathers
equally with kings should take drugs be-
fore their meals lest they be poisoned. So
the Scholiast sayS, ‘⁶ Pater qui perniciosum
filium habet aeque debet timere saluti suae
sicut rex.'' “ Ipsum autem regem (scrip-
tum est) assiduo talium medelarum usu a
clandestinis epularum insidiis cavisse.”
This is what Gellius says (xvii. 16).

256. allon-stro voluptatem eyreyiam]
This is addressed to the reader. He says
it is better thau a play to watch these
people getting money. As to the Praetor
see S. viii. 194, n. On ‘pulpita' see iii.
174, n., and ‘lauti' xi. 1. ‘Constent’
means ‘they eost.5 As to ‘arca‚' see note
on x. 25: “ut maxima toto Nostra sit
arca foro.” ‘Aerata’ is ‘bound with
bronze.' The temple of Castor was in the
Forum Romanum, and near it the bankers
had their places of business. They kept
the cash-chests of their customers in this
temple, where there were sentries. See
Cicero pro P. Quintio, c. 4: “nisi ad
Castoris quaesisset quantum solveretur,''
and Long’s note. As to ‘ fiscus ' see S. iv.
55, n. It is here put for private money,
which is not its technical sense. The tem-
ple of Mars Ultor was in the Forum Au-
gusti. He says the people took to keeping
their monev in Castor's temple ever since
Mars the A‘venger was robbed of his hel-
met, and shewed he couldn’t take care of
his own property. It is not known what
aet of sacrilege Juvenal is alluding to.
No doubt it was well understood.

262. Ergo omnia Florae] As to the
Floralia see vi. 250, and on the Megalesia

or festival of Cybele, xi. 193. The Cerealia
were hcl] in April and lasted one day.
There were plays acted at all these festi-
vals, and that is the meaning of ‘aulaea,'
as in vi. 67, where see note.

265. jactata petauro Corpora] ‘ Petau-
rum ’ is a Greek word πέδαυρον, or as it is
in Theocritus (xiii. 13) πέτευρον. Photius
(p. 426. 12) gives its meaning thus: πέτευ-
ρον· πᾶν τὸ μακρὸν καὶ {ardna-ru καὶ
μετέωρον ξύλον. This also gives the de-
rivation, μετέωρον, up in the air. With
the Romans it seems to have been used for
different kinds of amusement. See For-
cellini. In a fragment of Lucilius quoted
by Festus, “Sicut mechanici cum alto
exsiluere petaur0‚” it appears to mean a
stage from which persons took flying 1eaps,
and that is probably the meaning here.
There was a spring perhaps which helped
the jumper, and explains ‘jactata corpora'
in this place. The jumpers or whatever
they were, were called ‘petauristae.’ ln
some cases a wheel was used, on the oppo-
site sides of which two persons hung, it-
would seem, and as the wheel went round
one went up and the other down. The
‘rectus funis' is the tight rope. ‘Funam-
buli,³ or σχοινοβάται, as the Greeks called
them, carried their art to great perfection
at Rome. Horace illustrates the highest
order of genius by this art :

“ Ille per extentum funem mihi posse vi-
ire1 eggleilca meum qui pectus inaniter angit,
Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet.”

(Epp. ii. 1. 210.)

267. Corycia semper qui puppe] Corycia
is put for Cilician, Corycus being a promon-
tory of Cilicia. Among the products of that
country larg-ely exported to Rome was saf-
