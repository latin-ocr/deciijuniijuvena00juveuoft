a lighter instrument than the ‘marra‚' but to mean that ‘ they are such as to think '

SATIRA XVI.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS satire is said by Heinrich not to be found in two MSS. of Copenhagen. Lubinus
(1603) says of it, “Nec desunt qui hanc Satyram J uvenalis esse negent cum in anti-
quissimis codicibus non inveniatur. Aliter sentit magnus ille Scaliger filius (Joseph)
ut praesenti mibi quondam ipse indicavit.'' He does not say by whom its absence from
ancient MSS. is affirmed, and he had just before said that in very old MSS. it came
before the fifteenth satire. Calderini (about 1450) a contemporary of Valla says,
“ Penultimo loco haec Satira edita est a J uvenali, sed librariorum culpa in finem
translata 3 quem errorem ex codicibus antiquis facile dignoscas.’' Ruperti tells us Valla
says it is wanting in the oldest M SS„ but does not refer us to the place where he says
so. Caspar Barthius (1624) quotes from a MS. of his: “ Satira haec non postremo edita
est a Juvenale sed ordo debet esse ut istam sequatur praecedens. «Iuvenalis enim a
Paride in exilium extrusus non videtur sibi male esse. Ergo laudat militiam. Quidam
dicunt non esse ,Iuvenalis sed ab ejus amico appositam.” Barthius adds, “Nos si quis
sententiam rogarit dicemus J uvenalis plane nou esse. In eadem autem opinione fuit
olim Ang. Decembrius estque hodie J. Rutgersius '⁵ (Barth. Adv. xiv. 16). The Scho-
liast of Pithoeus sayS‚“ Ista a plerisque exploditur et dicitur non esse J uvenalis.” S. xvi.
v. 2 is quoted by Priscian, and v. 6 and 42 by Servius. The former lived about the
middle of the fifth century, and the latter rather earlier: the commentary (on virgil)
attributed to Servius has been interpolated in many places and cannot be relied on. But
the satire must have been extant in Priscian's time and supposed by him to be J uvenal’s.
Some parts of the Scholia of Pithoeus were written by one who was not a Christian
(see note on xiv. 103), and for this reason are supposed to be earlier than Constantine
(ΑΛ). 306). But other parts are by later hands, and the Scholium above mentioned is
not to be implicitly relied upon as of great antiquity. Jahn quotes a Scholium on a
Paris MS. which he assigns to the twelfth century, in which it is said that the satire
is by some not supposed to be genuine, but that this opinion is refuted by the quotation
of v. 42 by Servius.

Ι think the above is all the authority from old sources that can be addueed, and it
