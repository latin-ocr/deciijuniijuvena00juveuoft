four miles further than Bovillae from
Rome. See note on Juv. iv. 117, “Dignus
Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes.'’ This
place derived its name from Virbius, who,
according to Virgil (Aen. vii. 771, sqq.)
and his commentator, Servius, was the
same as Hippolytus, then he was killed,
Diana, admiring his chastity, had him
restored to life by Aesculapius, and placed
him under the care of the nymph Egeria
in the woods of Aricia.

56. praesto est milei Manius heres]
There was a proverb, “multi Manii
Ariciae,'' the meaning of which is doubt-
ful. Erasmus follows Festus, who says it
means there were many distinguished
persons at Aricia. This is not the mean-
ing if it is to this proverb Persius alludes.
‘ He has only to go to Aricia, or its neigh-
bourhood, and he will find ready to his
hand a Manius for his heir.' Manius was
a son of Earth, we see.

57. Progenies ferrae l]
‘terrae filius' (59), see note on Juv. iv.
98, “Unde fit ut malim fraterculus esse
gigantis.” The man says Manius is a son
of Earth, he cannot tell his own father
and mother. To which the poet answers,
that if any one were to ask him who was
his ‘ abavus‚’ his great-great-grandfather,
he might be able to tell, though not very
readily. Add another to him (atavus),
and yet another (tritavus), and you come
to a son of Earth, like Manius, who there-
fore turns out (v. 130, n.) in the course of
generations to be brother to the poet’s
aneestor in the sixth degree. ‘ Major
avunculus' is properly uncle to one’s
grandfather, and ‘maximus avunculus' is
one degree further back. So as the poet
cannot call Manius properly his ‘major
avunculus,' he calls him ‘prope major,’
which appears to Jahn “ratio sane fri-
gidiuscula.’' [‘ Ritu’ is used with a geni-
tive, or it may have an adjective in the

As to this and

same case. Here, according to Jahn, it
is the same in sense as ‘ rite-³]

61. Qui prior es, cur me] The refer-
enee here is to the λαμπαδηφορία, torch
race, which occurred at several of the
festivals in Greece. Some difficulty is
found in determining all the conditions
of the race, but the chief feature of it
was the passing of a lighted torch or sort
of candle from hand to hand, each runner
being careful not to extinguish the
flame, till he had delivered the torch to
the runner in advance of him. This
practice served the ancients as an illus-
tration for several purposes. Herodotus
compares with it the Persian way of pass-
ing on a royal message through the coun-
try by mouuted couriers (viii. 98). Lu-
eretius (ii. 77, sq.) illustrates by the torch
race the succession of generations in the
animal world ε

“Augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuun-
tur,
Inque brevi spatio mutantur saecla ani-
mantum,

Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt?

Plato had used the illustration in the
sanie way (Legg. vi. p. 776). The author
of the treatise Ad Herennium (iv. 46), ap-
plies it to one general succeeding another
in command of an army, and here Persius
likens to the runners a man of fortune and
his expectant heir.

‘ Qui prior es ³ is variously interpreted.
The commentators before Casaubon, and
some since (Jahn, and most of our own
translators), suppose it to mean that the
heir stands in advance of the man he is to
suceeed, aud receives the toreh from him.
There is no point in this, though Jahn
tries to make one by saying the man in
advance would try to snatch the torch
from the man coming up as quick as he
could, especially if it was nearly out.
