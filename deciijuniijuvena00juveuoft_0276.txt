D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Spes superest: tu tantum erucis imprime dentem.—

Haec exempla para felicibus: at mea Clotho

Et Lachesis gaudent si pascitur inguine venter.

Ο parvi nostrique Lares, quos ture minuto

Aut farre ct tenui soleo exorare corona,

Quando ego figam aliquid quo sit 1111111 tuta senectus

A tegete et baculo? viginti millia fenus

Pignoribus positis, argenti vascula puri
Sed quae Fabricius Censor 110101, ct (1110 fortes
De grege Moesorum, qui me cervice locata

8. 51, n. The man answers that these
lessons are very well for the rich and lncky‚
but his destiny is satisfied if he can fill his
belly by his obscene gains.

137. O parvi nostrique Lares,] The sa-
tire is well kept up. The man calls pite-
onsly and piously upon his Lares, and asks
when he shall lay hy a little competencc to
retire upon; and concludes in despair of
ever realiziug even his modest expectationS,
through the cruelty of Fortune who is deaf
to his prayers. ‘ Parvi nostrique’ means
that they are small and such 115 become his
condition. He reminds his Lares of his
frequent sacrifices, which are those of a
poor man, like the offerings of Horace's

Phidyle :

“ Si thure placaris et horna
Fruge Lares. . . .
Parvos coronantem marino
Rore deos fragilique myrto.

ἠὲ ἠὲ ὴὲ

Mollivit aversos Penates
Farre pio et saliente mica.’'

(o. iii. 23.)

‘ Figam' is a metaphor from hunting, as
Ruperti says. “rogote et baculo‚’ a rug
(v. 8) and staff, arc the marks of a beggar.
140. viginti milliafenus] The demands
he goes on to make are not very modest,
though he thinks they are so, considering
how much he has done to earn them : a
capital which shall be put out upon niort-
gage and bring him in twenty thousand
sesterces, a few small vessels of plain silver,
two stout beai-ers to carry him to the Circus,
with an engraver and a modeller, and with
these he will be content, for he expects of
course always to be a poor man. About
170,000 sesterces would be the capital he
asks for, if his interest was ‘legitimum‚'
that is twelve per cent„ a considerable for-
tune to make by such a trade, and though

it was 1055 than half the equestrian, he
could make up his mind to be satisfied.
‘ Argenti puri ' is unchased silver (x. 19).

142. Sed quae Fabricius Censor notet‚]
This is the celebrated C. Fabricius Luscinus
who was opposed to Pyrrhus In B.c. 275
he was Censor, and distinguished himself by
the severity of his proceedings for putting
down luxurious habits. In particular he
and his colleague, Q. Aemilius Papus, are
said to have degraded a senator, P. Cor-
nelius Rufinus, who had been dictator and
twice consul, for having in his possession
for use at his table (coenae gratia) ten
pounds’ weight of silver (Livy, Epit. 14;
Gell. iv. 8; xvii. 21). ‘ Notare' is the
technical word for the censor's mark (Hor.
S. i. 6. 20, n.: “censorque moveret Ap-
pius'⁵). Rufinus was removed “ob luxuriae
notam '³ (Gell. 1. 0.). Τ110 man affects to
want only plain silver cups, but they must
be massive.

143. De ¹qreye Moesorum] Moesia,
which compl-ised the whole of modern
Bulgaria and part of servia lying along
the south bank of the Danube and
bounded on thc south by M. Haemus, was
reduced to a Roman province in the time
of Augustus, It was afterwards, perhaps in
the time of Trajan, divided into two pro-
vinces, Superior and Inferior. The stoutest
slaves were got from Illyricum and the pro-
vinces 011 the Danube. Some MSS. have
‘ Medorum.’ See note on vii. 132 : “ longo
premit assere Medos.” Two men were of
course the smallest number that could carry
a chair or palanquin, and they must needs
be stout. The largest number was eight,
and six was a common number. See S. i.
64 : “ sexta cervice feratur.’' ‘ Locata' is
placed under the pole, if the reading be
right. It is that of all the MSS. Heinrich
would read ‘ locatum,' which Jahn has taken
into the text. Ruperti suggests ‘locantes'
‘Locatum ' is simplest. ‘Locata' can hardly
