cujus adventus afferat aliquid felicitatis?

cuta. sitss’ Juvenal asks therefore, “ What
do we either fear or desire with reason for
our guide, or what purpose is ever 50 for-
tunately conceived as not to lead to ‹lis-
appointment ?'' Ruperti thinks there is
some error, because no one ever heard of
such a phrase as ‘dextro pede concipere
votum? It is not ‘ concipere votuni‚' the
meaning of which would 110 10 utter a
prayer in a set form of words: Many MSS.
have ⁴ concupis,’ which is a clerical error.
[Ribbeck 1155 ‘conripis.’]

7. optantibus ipsis] That is by granting
men their desires, which are shortsighted
and sure to bring mischief (nocitura). The
opposition of ‘ toga ’ and ‘ militia ' is com-
mon. The particular ambition expressed
in ‘ toga ' is shown in what follows ς it is
public honours, to which men rise by their
cloquence only to pei-ish. ⁴ Ille ’ refers to
the soldier, not, 1 think, as the commcn-
tators following the Sclnoliast say, to Milo
the athleta. This example would not be
to the purpose. The perfect, ‘ periit,' has
the sense of the aorist. The other dies
because he trusts his own strength, and
because men admire 1115 511115. The final
syllable of ‘ periit ' is taken as long from its
position in the verse, not “through con-
traction or hiatus‚” as Ruperti says. Con-
traction would not make the first syllable
long. (See above, vi. 559, n. : “Magnus civis
obit et formidatus Othoni.”) ‘Confidere ’ is
commonly used m the sense of presump-

tion (Horace, C. iii. 4. 50, 11. : “ Fidensju-
ventus horrida brachiis '’). A small num-
ber of MSS. have ‘ admirandus‚’ which
Heinrich has adopted, I think rightly,
but it is not important. All other editors

‘ optantibus ’ has ‘ operantibus‚' the reading
of Cod. Beruensis 61. P. bas ⁴ op *Ι* tanti-
bus.’ We can hardly doubt that ‘ optanti-
bus ' 15 the true reading]

16. Lonffz‘num et magnos Senecae] Cas-
sius Longinus was a jurist of eminence
and a man of wealth, which he had got by
inheritance and probably increased during
1115 government of Syria. Nero coveted
his money and wasjealous of his reputation,
and got a Senatus consultum passed by
which he was banished to Sardinia Λα). 66 :
“ Nullo crimine nisi quod opibus vetustis et
gravitate morum praecellebat ’' (Tac. Anu.
xvi. 7). Suetonius says he was put to death
(see note on viii. 1), but he seems to have
been mistaken. Ruperti says he means
another of the same name, which is not
likely. Longinus was recalled by Vespa-
sian. The death of Seneca is referred to
above (S. viii. 212, n.). Through the
favour of Nero, who was his pupil, he ac-
quired cnormous wealth, which 110 offered
to the emperor as a gift at 11 time when 110
