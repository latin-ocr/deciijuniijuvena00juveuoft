6 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quum pars Niliacae plebis, quum verna Canopi
Crispinus, Tyrias humero revocante lacernas,
Ventilet aestivum dig-itis sudantibus aurum,
Nec sufferre qu'cat majoris pondera gemmae ε

Difficile est satiram non scribere.

Nam quis iniquae 30

Tam patiens Urbis, tam ferreus, ut teneat se,
Causidici nova quum veniat lectica Mathonis
Plena ipso 3 post hunc magni delator amici

have been the man spoken of below, S. i.
109; xiv.306; Persius ii. 36. See my note
on the above passage of Horace. The verse
is repeated Sat. x. 226. with the preceding
it is wanting in some MSS.

26. verna Canopi Crispinus‚] Canopus,
or Canobus, which gave its name to one of
the branches of the Nile, was about fifteen
miles from Alexandria, and a town of disso-
lute inorals, as scaports are wont to be. It
is for this reason that Juvenal makes his
upstart Crispinus a native of Canopus. How
he commended himself to Domitian, and
rose to be an eques, does not appear. One
of the Scholiasts says he was a paper-seller
of Alexandria. Juvenal attacks him again,
in the fourth Satire‚ in the vilest terms.
‘Verna' was a slave born in his master's
house: this man was therefore a ‘ libertinus.>

27. Duria-3 humero revocante lacernam]
The ‘lacerna ³ was a 10050 cloak worn over
the ‘ toga.' It was usually of costly dye and
material, being worn chiefly by the rich.
Stapylton translates the words ⁶ humero re-
vocante ’ ‘ which falling off his shoulders
still revoke ς’ and some commentators take
it in this way. Gifford has—

(Ἧι-1511111115, while he gathers now‚now flings
His purple open, fans his summer rings.’'

Hcmeansthat the man is showingoff the fine
texture of his cloak 3 and he quotes Ammia-
nus Marcellinus (xiv. 6) : “ Alii summum
decus in ambitioso vestium cultu ponentes
sudant sub ponderibus lacernarum, quas col-
lis insertas cingulis ipsis adnectunt, nimia
subteminum tenuitate perflabiles, expectan-
tescrebrisagitationibus,maximequesinistra,
ut longiores fimbriae tunicaeque perspicere
luceant? The words describe the way in
which the cloak was worn, hitched up on the
left shoulder by a brooch or something of
that sort,and floating in the wind,so that the
shoulder seemstopull it back. Graevius takes
‘ lac-ernas ' with ‘ ventilet,' and conjectures
‘aestivo auro.' This man appears to have had
light rings for summer, and heavier for win-
ter. That hc wore a gold ring does not
provethat he was an eques, for by the empe-

rors after Tiberius the privilege was given to
the lowest of the people (Hor. S. ii. 7. 9, n.).

30. iniquae Tam patiens Urbis‚] ⁸ So
tolerant ot' the town's iniquities.'

32. lei-lica BIatlzonis] This man is men-
tioned below (vii. 129) as a bankrupt, and
(xi. 31) as a blustering fellow. Martial
mentions him repeatedly as a profligate (vii.
10), 0 beggar (viii. 42 ; xi. 68), a ranter(iv.
81), a coxcombical speaker (x. 46). He was
so fat as to fill his litter, which was new as
his foi-tunes were, and short-lived. As to
the ‘ lectica,' or palankeeu, see Becker's
Gallus, Exc.on the Carriages, and Dict. Ant.
Also Hor. S. ii. 3. 214, n.; and Cic. in Verr.
ii. 5. 11, Long. See also the note on ver. 65
below. ‘ Causidicus ' is a title that Cicero
uses with more or less contempt. The pro-
per words for what we cau an advocate, or
counsel, are ‘orator' and ‘ patronus;’a ‘cau-
sidicus ³ was one of these of 0 lower sort. So
Juvenal says below: “ nee causidicus nec
praeco loquatur '³ (vi. 438), “ nec unquam
Sanguine causidici maduerunt rostra pusilli' '
(x. 120), ‘⁶ nutricula causidicorum Africa '’
(vii. 148). Forcellini quotes Cic. de Orat.
i. 46 : “ Non 0111111 causidicum nescio quem
neque proclamatorem aut rabulam 1100 ser-
mone nostro conquirimus.” See Quintilian
xii. 1.

33. mayni delator amici,] This may be
any low informer who betrayed his patron.
The informer's trade, of which two members,
Sulcius and Caprius, are mentioned by Ho-
race (S. i. 4. 66), reached its height under
Tiberius, and throve under his successors.
A famous one of the reign of Domitian was
M. Aquilius Regulus, who under Nero got
promotion and hatred by informing against
M. Crassus (Tac. Hist. iv. 42). Baebius
Massa was another of the 501110 tribe, a
freedman probably of some person of the
Baebia gens. Tacitus says he betrayed
Piso, and was universally hated then (Hist.
iv. 50). This was 111 the reign of Vespasian,
ΑΛ). 70. Ηο was then “e procuratoribus
Africae.” He became governor of Baetica in
Spain, and for his oppression of that pro·
vince was brought to trial, under Domitian,
