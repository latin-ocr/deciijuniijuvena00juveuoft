foro tria funera.'' The particulars there
as well as here are derived from Becker’s
GaJlus‚ Exc. Interment of the Dead. The
body was carried out on an open bier,
sometimes by relations, sometimes by peo-
ple of consequence, and sometimes, as this
passage shova, by the man’s freedmen.
‘ Hesterni Quirites' are citizens of yester-
day, who have but lately got their freedom.
‘ Capite induto' shows they wore the
‘ pileus' or cap, which was put on a slave’s
head when he was manumitted (see S. v.
82), ‘Candelae ' are torches burnt by the
bed-side. ‘Beatulus' is a sneer. As to
‘amomo' see note on Juv. iv. 108: “su-
dans Crispinus amomo Quantum vix redo-
lent duo funera.” ‘ Lutare' is to smear
as with mud. ‘Porta' is nowhere else
used for a house-door. Its proper mean-
ing is the gate of a city or camp. For-
cellini‚ who does not notice this exception,
shows the difference between ‘porta' and
‘janua’ or ‘foi-es? by Ovid’s comparison
between the soldier and the lover (Amor.
i. 9. 19) ι

“ Ille graves urbes, hic durae limen amicae
Olgsszt'} hic portas frangit, at ille

107. Tange, miser, venas] This is an-

other case where the man can say he has
no physical ailments 3 but he is asked how
he feels at the sight of money or his neigh-
bour's pretty wife. ‘Sed’ is understood
before ‘visa est.' ‘Puella' is so used in
J uv. ix. 74, where see note. As to ‘cor
salit ³ see note on J uv. vii. 160.

111. Positum est algente catino] He
supposes a frugal meal put before the
man, of dry vegetablcs on a cold dish, and
bread made of coarse flour (sifted through
a common sieve), and then invites him
to eat. But the man says his mouth is
tender, and he has a sore place in it which
he cannot think of hurting with plebeiau
beet. Persius adds, “You shiver when
sear makes your hair stand on end all over
your body (he calls it stubble); at an-
other time your blood is all on fire, your
eyes flash with rage, and all you say and
do is such that mad Orestes himself would
pronounce you mad.'’

What is meant by the last few verses is,
that the man who boasts that his blood
flows quietly in his veins, and that he is
neither too hot nor too cold, has only to
be excited by outward things, and his
quictness vanishes. Avarice, lust, appe-

tite, sear, passion, all have their influent-e ⁴

with him and rob him of his boasting.
