SATIRA VIII.

Roma Patrem Patriae Ciceronem libera dixit.

Arpinas alius Volscorum iu monte solebat

Poscere mercedes alieno lassus aratro;

Nodosam post hacc frangebat vertice vitem,

Si lentus pigra muniret castra dolabra.

Hie tamen et Cimbros et summa pericula rerum

Excipit, ct solus trepidantem protegit Urbem ς

Qui nunquam attigerant majora cadavera corvi,

2-15. Arpinas· alius] This was C. Ma-
rius, who was also horu at Arpinum of poor
parents who P 11111-5111115-115· got their living

says, “solebat l'so cere mercedes alieno
lassus amtro’ : ’he worked at the plough as
a hired labourer; but all this declamation
has no historical value. Marius was in
fact a country lad, the son of a poor pea-
aaut who cultivated his bit of land, and he
would work with his father until he was
summoned by the eonscription to joiu the
Roman armies. He scrved in the cavalry
at the siege of Numantia under Scipio
Africanus Minor. His military abilities
raised him to high estate, and he married
a great lady, Julia, the aunt of him who
was afterwards the Dictator C. Caesar.
The vine switch was commonly used sor
military floggings; and 110 says Marius
had the switch broken over his head if 110
did his work lazily, which he was not
likely to do. See note on vi. 479, “hic
frangit ferulaS‚’' where the way of speaking
is the same.

“ catenas Parthus et Italum Robur ''). be-
sides a stake for intrent-liments aud three
days' provision, so that as 1105011005, who
gives these particulars (Bell. Jud. iii. 5),
observes, the infantry were almost like bag-
gage mules. ‘Securis,’ the hatehet, was
a distinct thing from ⁴ dolabra,’ which was a
hatehet ou one side, but had a pick ou the
other. “ Forma est securis sed unica ct
simplici acie; parte altera iu mucronem
acuminata, quae serviebat maxime muris
diruendis ut prior illa vallo et lignis cae-
dendis.'’ This is what Lipsius says ς’ l'oliore.

219. Hie tamen et Cimbros] For about
six years the Romans were kept in a state
of great alarin by barbarian tribes from
the north, among whom the Cimbri were
the most important. Marius was recalled
from Africa to opposc them. In 13.c. 102,
in his fourth consulship, he defeated and
utterly destroyed the army of the Teutones
at Aquae Sextiae (Aix, near Marseille);
and iu the following year, being again
consul, he and Q. Lutatius Catulus de-
feated the Cimbri ou a plain called Campi
Raudii, near Vercellae in Gallia Cisalpina.
Plutarch records that there was more
eredit given to Marius than to Catulus,
though the soldiers of Catulus had done
more to get the victory. He adds that
the soldiers were prepared to prevent his
triumph, if Catulus were not allowed to
share it (Marius, c. 27). Marius had the
title of third founder of Rome giren him
on this occasion. See x. 280, n.

251.postquam ad Cimbros] This is only
a way of saying after the battle. Plutarch's
description of the slaughter is very painful.
The greater part of the army was cut to
pieces on the tield. Thosc who fied to their
camp were massaered by their women,
who strangled their own children and theu
hanged themselves ; and many of the meu
did 1111 same, or tied themselves to the
