Depreudas animi tormenta latentis in aegro
Corpore, deprendas et gaudia : sumit utrumque

Nuper enim, ut repeto, sanum Isidis et (jianymeden,

tioned below (xi. Δ13), isit be the same. He
is here represented as going about to the
money—leaders ofl'ering to give thriee the
usual interest and not finding 1111)- one sool
enough to trust him. The legal rate of
interest was twelve per cent. per aunum. or
(as it was paid monthly) oue per cent. per
mensem, but more was often taken. See
note on Hor. S. i. 2. 142 “ Quinas bic
capiti mercedes exsecat.'’ See Niebuhr (iii.
57), who says that the Romans got this
rate of interest from the Greeks, and that it
was not established till the time of Sulla.

10. l'ernam equilem,] ‘ Verna' is here
used in the sense of ‘ seurra‚' 11 parasite aud
bull'oou. See the words ‘ vernilis‚' ‘ verni-
litas‚' iu Forcellini. Martial, addressing a
man ofthis sort, says (i. 42) :

‘¹ Urbanus tibi, Caecili, videris :
Non es, credemihi: quid ergo? verna eS.”

Ruperti says the man was son of an eques
by a slave 111 bis family, because Martia!
speaks of ‘equitibus veruis’ begotten on
slave girls (i. 85). Juvenal means that
the man was of equestrian family though
he had not au equestriau fortune, and that
he was iu the habit ot' letting out his wit
fm- the price of a (liniter, which was the
wages ofa ‘scurras His humour was of
the home-bred kind, it had the stamp of
city retinement upon it; like Horam-fs
Maenius, of whom he says (Epp. i. 15. 26,

Η

 

rebus maternis atque paternis

For-titur absumptis urbanus eoepit haberi,

Scurra vagus non qui certum praesepe
teneret.''

The ‘pomerium,’ as Livy describes it (i.
⁷14), was a space on each side of the city

wall which ought to have been lest free
from buildings. But it was not so 111
later timeS.

14. Brulle'a praestabat] He says that
he has 11ο longer that 11110 complexioni
which 110 used to get by applying rouge or
something of that sort to his face. ‘Fascia ¹
is a bandage, and ‘viscum ’ is some sort
ot' gummy substance, such as face washes
or dyes were mixed with. ‘Bruttia’ be-
longs properly to the gum or whatever it
was. Pliny (H. N. xvi. ll) says eoagula-
ted piteh was called ‘Bruttia ;’ that this
sort was much used for medieinal purposeS,
and that it had a red tinge (xxiv. 7). The
name was from the Bruttii in the south ol'
Italy, where it was got. He says the man
had a forest of dry hair ou his head and a
shrnbbery of the same on his legs.

16. Quid macies (wyri veleri-53] ‘ What
means this leauuess, as of a siek old man
who at length is burning with a quartan,
and with fevcr which has made him long·
its home ?’ like a man reeovering from a
fever, and in the first stage of recovery.
(See note on S. iv. 57: “jam quartanam
sperantibus aegris.’') ‘Aegri veteris' is
like ‘ mollis avarus’ (below, v. 38). ‘veteres
caecos' (vii. 170), ‘nobilis indocti‘ (viii.
49), ‘plurimus aeger ' (iii. 232), ‘dubii
aegri ' (xiii. 121⁴), ‘nocentibus aegris’ (ib.
234). Both are adjectives ε the man is siek
and he is also old. ‘Olim ' for a long eon-
tinuous time is used before, vi. 316.

19. deprendas el glandia :] ‘Aegro ' ap-
plies oni)v to the first clause, ‘corpore ’ to
both.

222. Nuper enim, ul repeda] ¹ Repeto ²
means ‘l remember.² ‘Nuper’ does not
always mean that which was very lately,
but in former years. Hor. Epod. ix. 7:
