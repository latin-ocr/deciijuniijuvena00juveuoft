SATIRA XV.

Sauromataeque truces aut immanes Agathyrsi,

Hac saevit rabie imbelle et inutile vulgus,
Parvula fictilibus solitum dare vela phaselis

Et brevibus pictae remis incumbere testae.
Nec poenam sceleri invenies, nec digna parabis

Supplicia his populis, in quorum mcntc pares sunt

Et similes ira atque fames.

Mollissima corda ¹30

Humano genen‘ dare se natura fatetur
Quae lacrimas dedit : haec nostri pars optima sensus.
Plorare ergo jubet casum lugentis amici,

125. Sauromataeque truces] According
to Bentley's rule noticed above (xiii. 44)
thiS ‘ que ’ should be ‘ ve‚’ and so it is in a
few MSS. which Ruperti has followed. I
feel quite safe in following the great majo-
rity, which have ‘quest

126. rabie imbelle] A common hiatus.

—imbelle et inutile vulgum] This is
very'contemptuous, but not so strong as
Horace’s language (Epod. ix. 13) :

‘⁴ Fert vallum et arma miles ct spadonibus
Sel-vire rugosis potest.
Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol adspicit conopium.’'

“ Contaminato cum grege turpium Morbo
virorum '' (C. i. 37. 9). The construction
of the ordinary river boats is described by
Herodotus (ii. 96). They were built of the
wood of the acanthus and were propelled
by oars and sails which were made of
byblus. These boats were painted red, yel-
low, or green, and sometimes all those
colours, and the sails were composed of
squares of different colours. The name
extulisses& rescissa}
a bean, and it is supposed the name may
have been given to a certain sort of boat
from its likeness in shape to a bean-pod.
Servius on virgil, Georg. iv. 287, sqq„

‘⁸‘ Nam qua Pellaei gens fortunata Canopi
Accolit effuso stagnantem flumine Nilum,
Etrcircum pictis vehitur sua rura phase-

¹s'ays ‘tphssseli ’ were “breve’stliiilicu’l’aes‘iiffi-

us u un ur cum s veri us. ra-

bo (p. 788, D.) says that in the Delta
canoes of clay were used on the numerous

canals. Wilkinson (Anc. Eg. c. 9) has a

good many pages on ships and boats and a

coloured engraving of two that were richly

painted, but he makes no mention of boats

of clay. He says the custom-of painting
their boats “ in brilliant aud lively colours
continued to the latest times, long after
the conquest of the country by the Ro-
mans 3 aud when the Arabs invaded Egypt
in 638 under Amer the general of the
Caliph Omer, oue of thc objects that
struck thcm with surprise was the gay ap-
pearance of the painted boats of the Nile ’'
(vol. iii. p. 200).

131. Et similes ira atquefames] “ In
whose minds ragc and famine are equal and
alike ;” their rage is as strong as famine in
othch, and like in its effects.

—Mollissima corda] Nothing canbe more
touching and manly than the verses that·
follow, of which Ruperti has nothing better
to say than that they are spun out more in
the declamation style than that of satire.
Their style is that of nature, and there is
no satire so strong as that which brings the
pure emotions of nature into contrast with
the bad passions and vices of mankind.
Any body with a grain of feeling will come
with pleasant, surprise upon a sentiment so
true and simply expresscd after the revolt-
ing picture that has gone before. It is a
satisfaction to know that this severe satirist
could be tender when occasion required,
and knew the worth of manly tears.

134. Plorare erqo jubet] ‘ Ergo ' means
‘ she then who has given us tears bids us
use them in the expression of sympathy
with our suffering fellows.' ‘ Casum lugen-
tis amici' is the reading of Ruperti and
Heinrich. [Jahn and Ribbeck] have the
common reading, ‘causam dicentis,' which
is defended by making ‘ causam dicentis
amici ' and ‘ rei ’ one subject, thus: ⁴ squa-
lorem amici eausam dicentis reique.’ But
that construction is harsh. Several MSS.
aud old editions have ‘lugentis ;' ‘ casum '
is in very few. ‘ Squalorcm ' refers to the
appearance of mourning, beard unshorn,
