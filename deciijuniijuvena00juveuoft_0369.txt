SATI RA XIV.

Sed reliquos fugienda patrum vestigia ducunt,
Et monstrata diu veteris trahit orbita culpae.

Abstineas igitur damnandis ;

Una potens ratio est, ne crimina nostra sequantur

Ex nobis geniti: quoniam dociles imitandis

Turpibus ac pravis omnes sumus, et Catilinam

Quocunque in populo videas,

quocunque sub axe ς

Sed nec Brutus erit Bruti nee avunculus usquam.
Nil dictu foedum visuque hace limina tang-at

Intra quae puer est.

Procul hinc, procul inde puellae 45

their fathers’ steps which they ought to
avoid, and the track of vice which hasbeen
long before their eyes. ‘ Orbita’ is pro-
perly the track of 3 wheel.

38. damnandi35 hujus enim rel] Many
MSS„ and most of the old editions have
“damnis3 hujusce etenim? Achaintre
has that reading on the authority of all the
Paris MSS. P. has the reading of the
text. In the next line P. has ‘nec' for
¹ ne‚' which Hermann 1135 rather perverscly
adopted. ‘Hujus' depends upon ‘ po-
tensz' there is 0118 reason (even if there
were but 0118, ‘vel una’) that commands
this.

41. :rhu-pibus ae pravis] Both these
words are applied to the human shape, and
they may be here translated as they come
together ‘ ugly and det'ormedss ⁴ Pravus ’
is ‘awr π’

42. qitocunque sub axe ;] See viii. 116,
11., “Gallicus axis‚” and xiii. 89 as to
-‘ quocunque? He says a Catiline you may
find in any elimo, a Brutus or a Cato no-
where. M. Porcius Cato of Utica was the
half-brother of ServiJia, mother of M.
Junius Brutus the murderer of Caesar.
These two men bear no comparison in
point of character. It was enough for
Juvenal and those who thought and felt
with him that they were both opponents of
Caesar and reputed friends of liberty. Cato
was a man of rigid virtue and a suitable
example for this place. Brutus had less
that was noble in his private character.
Juvenal does not always choose his exam-
“ ples very fitly. Catilina was as depravcd
in private as in public life, and his dissolute
morale and extravaganee led him into those
desperate acts that eost him and 1115 friends
· their lives. Cato's parents both died when

118 was a child, and in this matter the
examples are not well chosen. The father
of Brutus was a respectable man, though
of his mother much scandal was spread in
connexion with C. Julius Caesar.

[After v. 43 Ribbeck inserts vv. 59-72.]

44. Nil dictu foedum] This means ‘ foul
language.’ ‘ Auditu’ would be more in
accordance with ‘ visu’ and the sense. In
the next line P. and a few other MSS. have
‘ pater' where most MSS. have ‘pue1·.'
The Scholiast’s reading in his lemma is
‘pater est,’ but his note is ‘ubi filios habes?
He must therefore have read ‘ es! Jahn
and Hermann have ‘pater est,' the other
editors ‘puer.’ Those two editors have
adopted from Cramer’s conjecture (on the
Scholiast in 1080) ‘ ah ' for ‘ 111118 ' [and
Ribbeck has the ‘ ah ’]. The MSS. have
‘ hinc,’ ‘hac,' and ‘ ac‚’ which is in P. The
two last have no meaning and seem to con-

firm the first, which if written ‘hc‚’ would
readily be changed into ‘ hac,’ and the
tendency of the MSS. to drop the ‘h' is
common. For ‘ inde,’ ‘ite ’ is found in two
Paris MSS. according to Achaintre. The
wonder is it does not appear in more ι the
common reading is sufficiently confirmed.
The language is that of the priests at the
mysteries. Sec S. ii. 89, 11. ⁴ Hinc—inde’
is equivalent to ‘ ubique.’ ‘ Puellae 18110-
1111111,’ as the Scholiast says, are ‘ mere-
trices.’ ‘ Pcrnoctantis parasiti' is the con-
temptible guest who for a dinncr sits up all
night drinking or gaming or both, and
singing low songs, with the master of the
house, to his 51131118 before the children.

‘ l'ernoctare,’ Britannicus says, is to pass ι

the m'dght away from home. It is always
so use .
