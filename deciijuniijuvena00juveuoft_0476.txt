Nil tibi concessit ratio;
Et quid tam parvum?

Sed nullo ture litabis,

Haereat in stultis brevis ut semuncia recti.

Haec miscere nefas 3 nec, cum sis cetera fossor,

Tres tantum ad numeros satyrum moveare Bathylli.
Liber ego ! Unde datum hoc sumis, tot subdite rebus?

An dominum ignoras, nisi quem vindicta relaxat?

119. Nil tibi concessit ratio· ς] Heinrich,
on the conjecture of Lipsius, has‘ Ni'
against all the MSS. I see no necessity
for the change, though it is ingenious.

(Ν11 tibi —' continues& what goes ²3before:
‘ni' would be the beginning of a new
sentence. ‘Et quid’ means, ‘and yet
what act is there so trifling as to put out
your finger P’ This omission of ‘ tamen '
after ‘et’ is not unconnnon. See Juv.
xiii. 91, n. ‘Et' 31111 ‘tamen’ are both
omitted in S. iii. 3. 58. Ηο continues,
‘Yon may think it strange that ev en 111
so 5111· all a thing 1’011 cannot do right, but
111111 111111 sacrifice as 1011 will, you 11’111
never get the gods to grant that 111 ·11f an
ouuce of what is 1ight should remain with
foolsz’ that 15, the Stoics' fools, of 11110111
Horace sayS, in words like these,‘ ‘Excidi
penitus vitium irae Caetera item nequeunt
stultis haerentia? Persius appears often
to have imitated Horace insensibly.

122. Haec miscere nesam] ⁴ Haec' is
“stultum 011111 rccto‚'' as Heinrich says.
A clown must not attempt to 11111100 the
Satyr dance of Bathyllus. Horace (Epp.
11.2.125),((111 qui Nunc Satyrum nunc
agrestem Cyclopa 11101’01111.’(1110101·1’
15 111 both cases 0111111( alent to ‘saltaress and,
like that v·e1h, 150011111011 with the accu-
51·11110 (Hor. S. i. 5. 63, “·Pistorem sz-ilta
ret uti C3clopa rogabat' ³.) As to Β11·
thysllu see Juv. vi. 63. 66,11. (Τ105
tantum ad numeros 11101’01·1’ 15 the sanie

tri 111111110 See note on Hor. C. iii.
18. 15, ‘Gaudet 1111151111 pepulisse fossor
’101 110110 ter·,''1am a·nothe1 instance ap-
pwncntl3 of Persius' insensible imitation of
Horace's language, though the subject is
diffeient.

124. Libe) eqo J] This 15 a contemptu-
ous way of lepeating the 1111111’51101·.115

‘Tot subdite rebus? ‘the 5011 int of so
11111111 thingsss 15 like Horace (S. ii. 7.75),

“Tune mihi dominus rmum imperiis ho-
minumque Tot tantisque minor.

125. nisi quem vindicta νεῖαι-αἰ 7] ‘But
him whose yoke the Vindicta removes.'
See note on 75. The next words are
supposed to be uttered in 3 101111 tone by
501110 master to 1115 servants : ‘⁶ Suppose you
hear one shout, ¹ Go, slave, and carry down
the scrapers to Crispinus' baths: loiter
you, trifler ?' the fears of slavery do not
make you quicken your pace, and there is
nothing outward that pnlls your strings.’'

’1’1111751ὲ1150 se)ems to come fron] Horace (S.
11. . ‚ n. :

“ Tu mihi qui imperitas alii servis miser,
atque

Duceris ut nervis alienis mobile lig- “

nuin.''

The allusion is to puppets pulled by wires
(νευρόσπαστα). [Jahn has a note with
references to passages in which this word
and others which contain the same 010-
ments (νευρο, σπα) are used. The Stoics
employed this word to express the passions
which affect man, as we see in M. An-
1011111115, 11. 2, “no longer to be pulled by
the strings like a puppet to unsocial
niovements ’³ (μηκέτι καθ’ ὁρμὴν ἀκοινώνη-
τον νευροσπασθῆναι), and x. 38; xii. 19,
111111 other passages] As to‘ jecore aegro’

see S. i. 12,11 n. The ‘domini’ are passionS.
‘·Stflgilesss ‘flesh- -scrapers, used after
bathing, are described in Dict. Ant„ Art.
Baths. Crispinus' baths, if there were
any that went by that name, we know
nothing of.

127. cessas nugator ?] ‘Cessare,' ‘ces-
sator‚' were the usual words for skulking
slaves. ‘ Cessator ' and ‘erro' were synony-
mous. See Hor. S. ii. 7. 100, “Nequam
et cessator Davus? and 113, “teque ip-
sum vitas fugitivus et erro'' (note). Else-
where the dealer says, “ Semel hic cessa-
vit et, ut fit, In scalis latuit metuens pen-
dentis habenae '³ (Epp. ii. 2. 14, sq.)-
