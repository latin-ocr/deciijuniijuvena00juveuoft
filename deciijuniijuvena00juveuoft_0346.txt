D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nos hominum divumque fidem clamore 019111115,

Dic, senior bulla dignissime, nescis

Quas habeat Veneres aliena pecunia? nescis

Quem tua simplicitas risum vulgo moveat, quum

Exigis a quoquam ne pejeret, et putet ullis

Esse aliquod numen templis araeque rubenti?
Quondam hoe indigenae vivebant more, priusquam

Saturnus fugiens, tunc quum virguncula J 11110

Et privatus adhuc Idaeis J uppiter antris,
Nulla super nubes convivia caelicolarum,

31. Nos hominum divumquefidem] ‘Pro
deum hominumque fidem' and others of
the same sort were common exclamations
among the Romans. Juvenal says false
and fraudulent as the age is, 111911 are
always calling loudly on all that is trust-
worthy and truc in heaven and earth.
‘ Fides ' is honesty, truth, that which may
be relied upon (see Long’s note 011 Cic.
Div. in Verrem, c. 3). I do not agree
with Heinrich, who like Ruperti says
‘fidem ’ is equivalent here to ‘auxilium.'
They take ‘nos ciemus' to mean that
Calvinus 11095 50, calling on the gods to
help him to recover his money. See below,
v. 78, sqq.

32. Quanto Faesidium laudat] Faesi-
dius is a ‘causidicus‚' but a man of sub-
stance, who has clients that 001119 into
court and applaud him loudly. ‘ Sportula’
means the clients who get the ‘sportula'
(S. i. 95, n.). The omission of ‘tanto'
before ‘ quanto' is common (see S. x. 13).
Pliny (Epp. ii. 14) describes with a good
deal of disgust how young 111911 with no
qualifications thrust themselves into the
inferior cour-ts, and adds what is to the
point here: that these pleaders are fol-
lowed by auditors of a like kind; slaves
whom they have hired for the purpose:
they collect in the middle of the basilica,
where the ‘sportula' is served out to
them as openly as in the dining-room:
these fellows go about from court to
court sor the same pay (the ‘sportula')‚
from which they have got the name σοφο-
κλεΐς (because they cried σοφῶς, 115 we say
‘ bravo ') or 111 Latin ‘ laudicani.’ He says
two servants of his own had been carried
off for this use the day before at three
denarii apiece, at which price a man may
be most eloquent, and may fill as many

benches as he pleases: for this enormous
shoutings are got up at a signal given by
the μεσόχορος (01· 19111101· of the chorus),
and they need a signal, for they cannot
hear what is said, and would not under-
stand it if they could, and those applaud
loudest who hear least. There is no
more entertaining writer than this younger
Pliny.

33. senior bulla dignissima] He means
he must be in his second childhood. The
Scholiast quotes the Greek proverb, δὶς
παῖδες οἱ γέροντες. ‘ Bulla ' 15 explained on
v. 164: “Etruscum puero si contigit
aurum.”

37. araeque rubenti ?] “Sc. igne, vel
potius sanguine victimarum” (Ruperti,
after the Scholiast). Most editors would
have suppressed the blunder, but that is
not Ruperti's way. It is plainly the
blood.

40. Saturnus fityiens,] That is before
Saturnus was driven from Olympus by
Jupiter (S. vi. 1, n.)‚ and took to the
reaping-hook in Latium, where he taught
the natives agriculture and became king
of the country. Hc is usually represented
with a reaping-hook in his hand. The
Greek legends varied as to the place
where Zeus was brought up when his
mother Rhea hid him from his father
Cronus. The common story was that she
took him to Crete, where he was educated.
Ida was a mountain mass of considerable
height in Crete. See xiv. 271, n.

42. Nulla super nubes] These feasts of
the gods belong, he means, to a later age
than that of Saturnus, to the age of heroes,
which Hesiod places the fourth in his
list. ‘Puer Iliacns’ is Ganymedes, who
is alludcd to in ix. 47: “et pulchrum ct
dignum cyatho caeloque.'' He is repre-
