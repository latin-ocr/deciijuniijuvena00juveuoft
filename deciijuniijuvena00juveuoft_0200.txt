D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Virgine Pygmaea, nullis adjuta cothurnis,
Et levis erecta consurgit ad oscula planta?
Nulla viri cura interea, nec mentio fiet

Damnorum : vivit tanquam vicina marito,

Hoc solo propior, quod amicos conjugis odit
Et serVOS, gravis est rationibus.

Bellonae matrisque deum chorus intrat et ingens
Semivir, obsceno facies reverenda minori,
Mollia qui rapta secuit genitalia testa

J am pridem, cui rauca cohow, cui tympana cedunt

sort of mock apology for the turreted
hair-dressing. “What is a woman to do
if she is shorter than a pigmy (without
her shoes), so short that she must rise on
her tiptoes to be kissed P '' Gifford gives
up this passage in despair, and leaves it
out, “not so much on account of its singu—
lar clumsiness as of his utter inability to
make any tolerable sense of it.'' There
can be no doubt of the meaning Ι think.
But others have been given. The Pygmaei
were thc little folk who fought with
cranes (Hom. Il. iii. init). They come in
again, S. xiii. 168.

508. Nulla viri eura] The woman who
is thus dressing herself out for her para-
mours cares nothing all the while for her
husband, and says nothing of the losses he
suffers through her neglect and extrava-
gance. She lives as if she were a mere
neighbour and acquaintance of herhusband,
except that she makes a point of hating
his friends and servants, and is a burden
to his purse. Rutgersius on Horace, C.
iii. 19. 24, “Et vicina seni non habilis
Lyco‚'’ compares this verse of J uvenal's.
But the sense is different (see note there
in my edition). The want of a conjunction
before ‘gravis' makes Ruperti think a
verse or two is lost. There is nothing very
remarkable in the asyndeton, as it is called.
[Ribbeck and Jahn have ‘ vicina mariti.’]

511. Ecce furentis Bellonae] He goes
on to speak of the superstitious of women,
and introduces first a company of priests
of Bellona and of Cybele srightening a
woman out of money to buy a lustration,
and out of her clothes, under the pretence
that all the dangers of the coming year
will go with them. Bellona was worship-
ped from the earliest times in Italy as the

goddess of war, but her first temple at
Rome seems to have been built by Appius
Claudius, ΛΑΜ). 458, in the Campus Mar-
tius (Livy x. 19). The character of her
mad rites has been referred to before (S. iv.
124). They were accompanied with
disturbances and noisy processions which
were a nuisance to the inhabitants. See
note on Hor. S. ii. 3. 223 : “ Hunc circum-
tonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis.” Her
priests, who were numerous, were called
Bellonarii. As to the rites and priests
(Galli) of Cybele, the mother of the gods,
see S. ii. 111, n. The chief priest was
called Archigallus, and he is the person
meant by ‘ingens semivir,' the burly
eunuch (see Pers. S. v. 186, ‘grandes
Galli ¹¹), to whom the lesser eunuehs
(obsceno minori) bowed down, and gave
way, and stopped their drums as he passed.
He wears a cap tied under his chin, such
as they wore in Phrygia, from whence they
came. As to ‘testa’ Pliny (xxxv. 12)
says: “Samia testa Matris Deum sacer-
dotes qui Galli vocantur virilitatem ampu-
tant nec aliter citra perniciem.'’ The
pottery of Samos was very hard, and capa-
ble of being sharpened. Martial speaks of
it as used for the same purpose (iii. 81).
Juvenal, above, says it was the custom
“ supervacuam cultris abscindere carnem ”
(ii. 116). Sharp flints are spoken of in
the same connexion by Ovid (Fast. iv. 237,
‘⁵ Ille etiam saxo corpus laniavit acuto '')
and others. ‘Rapta testa’ expresses the
enthusiasm of the man. Ruperti, with his
usual want of judgment, adopts ‘rupta'
from two MSS. and some old editions.
The MSS. are from the same original. M.
has ‘ rupta!
