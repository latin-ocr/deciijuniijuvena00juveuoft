SATIRA XVI.

Declamatoris mulino eorde Vagelli,
Quum duo crura habeas, offendere tot caligas, tot

Millia clavorum.

Quis tam procul absit ab Urbe

25

Praeterea? quis tam Pylades molem agg-eris ultra
Ut veniat? Lacrimae siccentur protinus, et se
Exeusaturos non sollicitemus amicos,

“ Da testem‚'' judex quum dixerit.
Nescio quis pugnos qui vidit dicere, “ Vidi,”

Audeat ille

Et credam dignum barba dignumque capillis

hlajorum.

Citius falsum producere testem

Contra pag-anum possis quam vera loquentem
Contra fortunam armati contraque pudorem.

Praemia nune alia atque alia emolumenta notemus

sacramentorum. Convallem ruris aviti

The name occurs abore, xiii. 119. Most
MSS. have ‘Mutinensis' where P. and a
few others have ‘mulium’

25. Quis tam procul absit] “Resides
this (he asks) who would come so far from
town, who is so fast a friend (such a Py-
lades) that he will come out to the camp to
gire evidence for you? We had better
dry up our tears forthwith and not plague
our friends who are sure to make excuses,
when the judge tells us we must bring
wituessesss’ ‘Molem aggeris' is referred to
in x. 95, “castra domestica,’'and mentioned
in S. v. 153, ‘¹ in aggere rodit,'' and note.
The praetoriam camp is here referred to.
‘ Tam procul' therefore is ironieal, for the
camp was not above a quai-ter of a mile
from either of the two gates Collina and
Esquilina, north—east of the city. A man
must be a Pylades to take such a walk for
a friend, though the Agger which over-
looked the camp was a common promenade.
The judex here is the military officer who
heard the eomplnint.

33. Contra paganum possis] ‘Paganus'
after the time of Augustus came¹t0 bc ap-
plied to all civilians as opposed to military
men. It may have been first given them
by soldiers in the way of contempt, for it
belongs properly to the country people.
Pers. Prol. 6, 11. ‘ Pudorem? is his honour,
which the soldier is supposed to prize more
than the inan of peace. The word is so
used in viii. 83: “ Summum crede nefas
animam praeferre pudori.''

36. sacramentorum] ‘ Sacramentum '
was the soldier’s oath which he sworc by
the ‘ signa' (standards), promising fidelity
to his country and his commandcr. The

oath was administered ou enlistment. It is
used here for military service, and is put in
the plural number as ‘stipendia,' which
means ‘eampaigus‚’ that is properly the
number of times a soldier has earned pay,
as ‘ sacramenta' would be the number of
times he has taken the nath, which as long
as he remained with the army would or-
dinarily be only once, though there were
cases in which it was repeated. Tacitus
speaks of “miles urbanus longo Caesarum
sacramento imbutus '' (Hist. i. 5).
—Convallem ruris aviti] He says if any
man robs him of his land, removes his
laudmark, or denies his debts, he will have
to go through all the law's delays before he
can get justice, which is promptly adminis-
tered in campS. ‘ Convallis' is said to be
properly a valley surrounded 011 all sides
with hius, and ‘vallis' oue between two
ranges. The stone or other boundary by
which private property was marked off
(Hor. Epp. ii. 2. 170, n., “qua populus
adsita certis Limitihus vicina refugit jur-
gia '') was sacred. The lands were in the
first instance divided by the Agr-imensores
with religious ceremonies, and offerings
were annually made close by them to the
god Terminus, whose image was often no
more than a shapeless stone. The neigh-
bours met and offered sacrifice jointly at
the Terminalia. Cakes of flour and honey
(liba) ground ‘far ' (puls, S. xi. 58, note)
were commonly offered, and by those who
could afford it a lamb or young pig was
added (see Horace, Epod. ii. 59, “ Vel agna
festis caesa Terminalibus,'' and Epp. i. 10.
10,“thuesacerdotisfugitivuslibarecuso'').
