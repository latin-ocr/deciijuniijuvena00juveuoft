D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ι nunc et dubita qua sorbeat aera sanna
Tullia, quid dicat notae collactia Maurae,
Maura Pudicitiae veterem quum praeterit aram.

Noctibus hic ponunt lecticas,
Effigiemque Deae longis siphonibus implent,

micturiunt hic,
310

Inque vices equitant ac Luna teste moventur.
Inde domos abeunt : tu calcas luce reversa
Conjugis urinam magnos visurus amicos.
Nota Bonae secreta Deae, quum tibia lumbos

Incitat et cornu pariter vinoque feruntur

315

Attonitae crinemque rotant ululantque Priapum

Maenades

O quantus tunc illis mentibus ardor

Concubitus! quae vox saltante libidine ! quantus
Ille meri veteris per crura madentia torrens!

Lenonum ancillas posita Saufeia corona

320

Provocat et tollit pendentis praemia coxae :
Ipsa hledullinae fluctum crissantis adorat.
Palmam inter dominas virtus natalibus aequat.
Nil ibi per ludum simulabitur : omnia. fient

Ad verum, quibus incendi jam frigidus aevo

325

Laomedontiades et Nestoris hernia possit.
ι Tunc prurigo morae impatienS‚ tunc femina simplex.
It toto pariter repetitus clamor ab antro :

306. Immo et dubita] “ Go now and
doubt when you are told with what a sneer
Tullia suuffs the air.'' The order of these
verses varies in the MSS„ 307 and 308
changing places 111 3 very few. Jahn and
Ruperti [and Ribbeck] have followed
Achaintre in that arrangement. Hein-
rich keeps to the connuon reading, which
there is no necessity for changing. P. and
three of Achaintre’s MSS. omit 307. ‘ Col-
laetia ² is a ‘ foster-sister.’ ‘ Collactanea '
is a form of the same word found 111 the
jurists. See Forcellini, who shows from
inscriptions in Gruter that ‘ collactia,’ not
‘ collactea ’ as many MSS. have it, is the
right form, though he gives both. Col-
latia, a proper name, is the reading of
nearly all the old editions. As to the
temples of Pudicitia, see note ou v. 1 of
this Satire. ⁶ Maura ’ is brought in again
in S. x. 224.

313. magnos visurus amicos] That is
at the early ‘ salutatio ' (S. i. 95. 127).

314. ὒόῗα Bonae secreta Deae,] “ No-
torious are the good goddess' secret rites.”
On these, see S. ii. 86, sqq.

316. Atffonz'tae crinemque rotant] ‘At-
tonitae ' is the proper word. for impiration,
like ἐμβρόντητος. Horace says, “ Ternos
ter cyathos attonitus petet Vates ’³ (C. iii.
19. 14). Priapus and Dionysus were eon-
founded in the older Greek legendS, and so
they are here. Their worship, however,
was distinct in historical times. Respecting
that of Priapus, who was the protector of
gardens aud orchards, and also of flocks and
hei-ds, and who represented the principle of
fertility, see note on Hor. S. 1. 8. 1, “Olim
truncus eram ficulnus.” The MSS. and.
editions vary between Priapi and Priapo,
which last appears 111 most. ‘ Ululantque ' is
in these changed to ‘ ululante‚' which must
have been donebecau se Priapo was not under·
stood. It must originally have been Priapfi
for Priapom, which case Ruperti and Hein-
rich prefer. I believe it to be the true MSS.
reading. [Ribbeck and Jahn have ‘Priapi ς’
and Ribbeck omits v. 323]

328. It tolo] [Ribbeck and Jahn have
‘ ac pariter toto: and a comma after ‘ sim-
plex ;’ and in v. 332, Ribbeck has ‘veniet’
for ‘ venit et.']
