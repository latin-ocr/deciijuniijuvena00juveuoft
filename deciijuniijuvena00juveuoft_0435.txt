103. Haec The
Scholiast explains this rightly, isit wants
explanation. “Tam mollia et virtute rerum
carentia carmina, si in nobis aliquid pa-
ternae virtutis remansisset, componeremus,
si quicquam in nobis virilitatis esset, vel si
masculi essemus non delumbes?” ‘De-
lumbe ' he also explains “fractum et
enerve, quia in lumbis vel renibus virtus
est.’' ‘ Elumbis' is used in the same way,
Dial. de Orat. c. 18: “Facile est depre-
hendere Ciceronem a Calvo quidem male
audivisse tanquam solutum et enervem ; a
Bruto autem, ut ipsius verbis utar, tan-
quam fractum atque elumbem.” It was a
proverbial saying that a chatterer’s speech
floated on his tongue. Theophrastus (Char.
vii. fin.) says of such a man χαλεπὸν τῷ
λάλῳ ἐστὶ σιωπᾶν, καὶ ὡς ἐν ὑγρῷ ἐστὶν ἡ
γλῶττα, where Casaubon quotes this verse
of Persius, who means that this sort of

fierent si testiculi]

poeti-y is mere gabble generated on the
tongue and not coming from the brain.
He says it is not of the kind that beats the
wall or savours of the bitten nail. ‘ Plu-
teus: as mentioned on J uv. ii. 7, is a book-
case fixed against the wall. The lang-uage
is like that of Damasippus to Horace (S. ii.
3. 7, n.) ι

“ Culpantm· frustm calami, immeritusque
Irssffioffius paries diis atque poetis.”

The poet who is in earnest bites his nails
or raps the-wall with his knuckles in his
impatience and perplexity. These fluent
ῂῃῗδξῗ Ἑξάῃῖιῗῖάᾶἓῖαέοὸίῗηεναε] He sup-
> poses some one to ask, “ But supposing all
this to be true, what necessity is there to
rasp tendet ears with biting truths? Take
care if you please (‘sis,' ‘si vis ') lest the

doors of the great by any chance grou· eool
upon you : the dog's letter is heard
there.'' The dog’s letter is R, as coming
nearest to the snarling of a dog, which is
‘hii-rire) His friend advises him as if he
heard the dog snarling and bidding him
keep away. Lucilius in a line pre-
served in Charisius (i. p. 100, Putsch„ sce
Forcellini, Hirrio)‚ says of this letter,
“ Irritata canis quod homo quam planius
dicit.'' English readers will remember
the dialogue of the nurse and Romeo (Act
ii. Sc. 4) z

“ N. Doth not rosemary aud Romeo be-
gin both with a letter Ρ

“R. Aye, nurse, what of that? Both
with an R.

“ N. Ah moeker! that’s the dog’s name.
R is for the dog. No, Ι know it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the
prettiest sententious of it, of you and rose-
mary, that it would do you good to hear
it.” In most Roman houses there was a
dog kept in the porter's room by the door.
(Hor. S. ii.6. 114, n.: “domus alta Molos-
sis Personuit canibus.’') ‘Majorum limina
frigescant ⁹ is imitated perhaps from Ho-
race, whose friend says much the same to

him (s, ii. 1. 60)2

O puer, ut sis
Vitalis metuo, et majorum ne quis amicus
Frigore te feriat-’'

ῗΙΟ. >Per me equidem] ‘Equidem’ if
compounded of ‘ ego quidem,' as is gene-
rally supposed, must originally have been
conlined to verbs in the first person. Te-
rence, if the MSS. are right, once uses
‘equidem’ without reference to the first
person (Eun. v. 4. 34), and so does Pro·
