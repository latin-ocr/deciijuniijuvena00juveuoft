Sed gladiator erat: facit hoc illos Hyacinthos 3

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

110

Hoc pueris patriaeque, hoc praetulit illa sorori

Atque viro.

Ferrum cst quod amant.

Hic Sergius idem

Accepta rude coepisset Veiento videri.
Quid privata domus, quid fecerit Hippia, curas?

Respice rivales Divorum : Claudius audi
Dormire virum quum senserat uxor,

Quae tulerit.

115

Ausa Palatino tegetem praeferre cubili,
Sumere nocturnos meretrix Augusta cucullos,
Linquebat comite ancilla non amplius una:

Sed nigrum flavo crinem abscondente galero

120

Intravit calidum veteri centone lupanar

110.sace't hoc illos Hyacinthos ;] Their
trade makes beauties of them (such as the
Spartan boy, Hyacinthus, whom Apollo
loved, Ov. Met. x. 162, sqq.). He says the
secret is their horrid love for blood, and as
soon as Sergius takes the ‘rudis ³ (see note
on 105), he will come to be looked upon as
no better than her cast-off husband.

115. Respice rivales Divorum:] ‘ Ri-
vales ' in its legal sense means those “qui
per eundem rivum aquam ducunt” (Dig.
43. 20. 1. ξ 26), “who made use of the same
water-channel.³’ The derived sense had
reference only to rivalry in love ε what we
call rivalry in a general way was ‘ aemu-
latio,' which when it is ‘vitiosa,' ‘bad‚'
Cicero says is “rivalitati similis,'' “like
rivalry in love ” (Tusc. iv. 26. See For-
cellini). ‘ Divorum' are the emperors and
their rivals are the frequenters of the
stews mentioned below.

Claudius audi Quae tulerit] The
Emperor Claudius had four wives. He
divorced two, and the third was Valeria
Messalina, to whom he was married when
lie succeeded to the Empire‚ ΑΛ). 41.
Her amours were unbounded, and she came
to her end in consequence of an out-
rageous act of profligacy and folly. While
the emperor was absent from Rome she
married public-ly one C. Silius, a young
lover for whom she had conceived a violent
passion, and had discarded a pantomimus,
Mnester, who had been her last paramour
(Sat. x. 329, &c.). For this act Claudius
was induced reluctantly to order her death,
Λ.]). 48. Tacitus, Ann. xi.1—38. Dion.
Cass. lx. 14--31‚ Suetonius, vit. Claudii,
give full details of this bad woman's life.
Pliny, by one anecdote not fit for tran-

scription, confirms the worst of Juvenal’s
description. (H. N. x. 63.)

117. Ausa Palatino] The imperial pa-
lace was on the Mons Palatinus, as stated
above (S. iv. 31, n.). ‘ Teges ' is any kind of
coarse bed-covering (v. 8. vii. 221, ‘ hi-
bernae tegetis 3' ix. 140). Augusta was the
title of the emperors’ wives, as they all had
that of Augustus themselves. ‘ Cucullus ’
was a hood attached to the ‘ lacerna,' which
might be thrown over the head for conceal-
ment or protection against the weather.
Horace describes a man going out on the
same errand as Messalina “odoratum caput
obscurante lacerna.” (S. ii. 7. 55). See
above, i. 62 ; iii. 170. The absence of ‘et '
after ‘ cubili’ has caused a great deal of trou-
ble to the commentators. It is not wanted.
[Ribbeck places the verse ‘ Linquebat,' ὅσα,
after v. 116, with a full stop after ‘una.'
He also places v. 118 before v. 117, and
has

‘ -— cucullos
Ausa, Palatino tegetem praeferre cubili,
Sic nigrum,' ἃς]

120. crinem abscondente galero] This
is a wig, which she put on overher own hair.
‘Galericulum ’ is used in this sense else-
where, but not ⁶ galerum ' (see Forcellini).
The Scholiast says in explanation, “ Crine
supposito: rotundo muliebri capitis tegu-
mento in modum galeae facto 3 quo uteban-
tur meretrices flavo, nigro enim crine ma-
tronae utebantur.” Gifford quotes from
Menander ε

νῦν Χδ’ ἔῤῥ’ ἀπ’ οἴκων τῶνδε, τὴν ’γυναῖκα
α

vbis zffisppov’ οὐ δεῖ ’τὰς τρίχας ξανθὰς
ποιειν.
