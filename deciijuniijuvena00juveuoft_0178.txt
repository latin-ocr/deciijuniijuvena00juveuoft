D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Grande supercilium et numeras in dote triumphos,

Tolle tuum, precor, Hannibalem victumque Syphacem 170
In castris et cum tota Carthagine migra.

“ Parce, precor, Paean, et tu depone sagittas,

Nil pueri faciunt, ipsam configite matrcm‚”

Amphion clamat : scd Paean contrahit arcum.

Extulit ergo greges natorum ipsumque parentem,

175

Dum sibi nobilior Latonae gente videtur
Atque eadem scrofa Niobe fecundior alba.
Quae tanti gravitas, quae forma, ut se tibi semper

‘ Malo, Venus, nullam quam,' δῖα,

&c.‚ a reading which few persons will pre-
fer to the common text.]

169. numeras in dote triumphos] “Count
triumphs in your ‘dos,' as part of it.'’ In
the first Punic war two Scipios had tri-
umphS, oue for victories in Sicily, the other
in Corsica and Sardinia. The father of
Africanus Major, P. Cornelius Scipio,
though no match for Hannibal, distin-
guished himself in opposing the Cartha-
ginians in Spain. 'rhe triumphs that
Juvenal mentions were those of Cornelia’s
father, who however triumphed only once
for the victory over Hasdrubal the Cartha-
ginian general and Syphax their N uxnidian
ally, whose camps he burnt, B.c. 203 (Livy,
xxx. c. 5), and for the defeat of Hannibal
near Zama, B.c. 202. ‘ Migra’ means ‘get
you gone,' like ‘collige sarcinulas et exi'
above (v. 146).

172. Parce, precor, Pacem] Niobe is
introduced as the type of fecundity. Ac-
cording to the story derived from Homer,
the earliest authority (Il. xxiv. 602 sqq.,
where Achilles is comforting Priam for the
loss of his son), she had six sons and six
daughters. The Scholiasts on this place
and on Euripides (who mentions her seven
daughters, Phoen. 159) give her seven of
each. Other writers give her more or
fewer. Her husband was Amphion, the
hard—king of Thebes, who here eries to
Apollo and Diana to spare his innocent
children and to pierce their mother. ‘Tu'
is addressed to Diana, who, the story in
Homer says, shot the daughters while
Apollo killed the sons. Graevius proposed
‘ tu Dea pone’ for ‘tu depone' against all
the Mss.; and Ruperti and Jahn have
this reading, which is quite unnecessary.
[Ribbeck also has ‘tu, dea, pone sagittas.']
The father’s agon)r is quite as well, and
perhaps better, expressed by ‘tu’ alone.

The scene is made more present. Heinrich
keeps the MSS. reading. Τ110 Florence
group of Niobe and her children, which is
attributed to Scopas, represents the mo-
ther in anguish pressing her youngest
daughter, a girl of about ten, to her lap ;
aud twelve other children, five of whom
are girls and seven sons, one a boy and the
rest grown up, in various attitudes of pain
or fear. The group is engraved in C. Ο.
Muller’s Denkmaler der Alten Kunst,
Goettingen, 1835, an excellent publication.
17 5. ipsumque parentem] According to
ovid (Met. vi. 271) Amphion killed him-
self for grief at the death of his children:

“Nam pater Amphion ferro per pectus
Finiziigtciiioriens pariter cum luce dolorem.”

Other traditions give him a different end.

Ovid tells the whole story; putting a long Ι

boastful speech in the mouth of Niobe,
while all the Theban women were going
forth to do honour to Leto. He gives her,
like the Scholiasts, seven sons aud seven
daughters. ⁴ Extulit ’ means carried forth
to burial, as in S. i. 72, “nigros efferre
maritos.” The story is that the victims
lay nine days unburied, and that on the
tenth the gods buried them, Niobe having
been turned to stone, and all that would
have performed this office for her children.

177. scrofa ,Niobe fecundior alba]

‘ Scrofa ' is a ‘ breeding sow.' The sow
here meant is Aeneas'
‘⁴ ——ingens inventa sub ilicibus sus,

Triginta capitum fetus enixa, ·—---
Alba, solo recubans, albi circum ubera
nati.'' (Aen. iii. 390 sqq.)

[Ribbeck omits the six following 1ines.]

178. ut se tibisemper Imputet ἲ] “ That
she should always take credit for herself
with you.’' As to ‘iinputare‚' see S. ii.
17, n.
