D. J UNII J UVENALIS

Exitus ergo quis est? O gloria! vincitur idem

Nempe et in exsilium praeceps fugit atque ibi magnus 160
Mirandusque cliens sedet ad praetoria regiS,

Donec Bithyno libeat vigilare tyranno.

Finem animae quae res humanas miscuit olim

Non gladii, non saxa dabunt, nec tela3 sed ille

Cannarum vindex et tanti sanguinis ultor
Ι, deme-ns, et saevas curre per Alpes,

Annulus.

Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias.
Unus Pellaeo juveni non sufficit orbis ι
Aestuat infelix angusto limite mundi,

Ut Gyari clausus scopulis parvaque Seripho :

170

Quum tamen a figulis munitam intraverit urbem,

Sareophago contentus erit.

Quantula sint hominum corpuscula.

Mors sola fatetur

Velificatus Athos, et quidquid Graecia mendax

159. vincitur idem Nempe] “ He is
beaten in his turn of course ;” that is by
Scipio at Zama, B.0. 202. After the treaty
of peace concluded the next year Hannibal
remained several years at Carthage‚ and it
was not till the year B.c. 193 that finding
himself in danger from enemies at home
he fied secretly and went to Antiochus,
with whom he remained three years and
helped him against the Romans. When
Antiochus was defeated, in B.c. 190, Hanni-
bal fled to Prusias, king of Bithynia. For
seven or eight years he continued to be
his guest, helping him in his wars, till the
Romans finally sent a demand for his sur-
render, which Prusias was not able to
resist. Hannibal, to avoid falling into the
hands of the Romans, took poison, which
he is said to have carried about with him
for that purpose in a ring; therefore
Juvenal says a ring was the avenger of
Cannae and of all the blood that Hannibal
shed. Pliny says that Demosthenes also
kept the poison with which he destroyed
himself in a ring (N. H. 33. 1).

167. et declamatio fias] See note on
S. vii. 161. Horace has “ Cognomen vertas
in risum et fabula fias’' (Epp. i. 13. 9).

168. Unus Pellaeo juveni] Valerius
Maximus (viii. 14. Ex.) tells the following
story of Alexander: ‘¹ J am Alexandri pec-
tus insatiabile laudis, qui Anaxarcho comiti
suo ex auctoritate Democriti praeceptoris
innumerabiles mundos esse referentist Heu
me (inquit) miserum! quod ne uno quidem
adhuc potitus sum? '’ Valerius adds,

“Angusta homini possessio gloriae fuit

quae Deorum omnium domicilio sufficit 2⁹⁹
“ Post Darium et Indos pauper est Alex-
ander Macedo '' (Sen. Ep. 119). ’

170. Ut Gyarz‘ clausus scopuli-⁹] See ἱ.
73, n.‚ and vi. 564. Gyarus and Seriphus
were islands in the Cyclades group, to
which criminals were transported. Seri-
phus was the larger of the two, and about
twelve miles in circumference. The mo-
dern name is Serfo.

171. a fiyulis munitam] The town of
Babylon is said to have been built of
brick cemented with asphalt by Semiramis.
“ Dicitur altam Coctilibus muris cinxisse
Semiramis urbem '’ (Ovid, Met. iv. 57).
Here Alexander died, B.c. 323, in his
thirty-third year. A ‘sarcophagus’ was
properly a coffin composed of a particular
stone from Assos in Troas, which was said
to consume the body (σάρκα φαγεῖν). “In
Asso Troadis sarcophagus lapis fissili vena
scinditur. Corpora defunctorum condita
in eo absumi constat intra XL diem excep-
tis dentibus'' (Pliny xxxvi. 17).

173. Quantula sint hominum corpu-s·-
cula. ] This idea is a favourite one with the

poets. The best known allusion to it 1s in
Shakespeare’ s Henry IV. P. i. Actv. Sc. 4.

“Fare thee well, great beart!
111- -w eaved ambition‚ how much art thou
shrunk. '
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound ς
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough.”

174. Velzfieatus Athos,] To avoid the
