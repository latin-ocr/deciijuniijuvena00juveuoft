D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Spondet enim Tyrio stlataria purpura- filo.

Et tamen est illis hoc utile : purpura vendit

135

Causidicum, vendunt amethystina: convenit illis
Et strepitu et facie majoris vivere census.

Sed finem impensae non servat prodiga Roma.
Fidimus eloquio? Ciceroni nemo ducentos

Nunc dederit nummos nisi fulserit annulus ingens.

140

Respicit haec primum qui litigat, an tibi servi
Oct0, decem comites, an post te sella, togati

Ante pedes,

Ideo conducta Paullus agebat

Sardonyche, atque ideo pluris quam Cossus agebat,

Quam Basilus.

Rara in tenui facundia panno.

145

Quando licet Basilo flentem producere matrem?
Quis bene dicentem Basilum ferat? Accipiat te
Gallia vel potius nutricula causidicorum

Africa, si placuit mercedem imponere linguae.

‘ Maedos?
tribe about the upper waters of the rivers
Axius and Margus, and north of Mace-
donia.

1343] Spondet enim Tyrio] He says the
man’s purple cloak gets him credit. The
meaning of ‘stlataria’ is very doubtful.
‘ Stlata ’ is said to be a small piratical
craft, and from that Foreellini explains
‘ stlataria' as foreign, brought over the sea
in ships. The Scholiast says it means
‘illecebrosa,' and he quotes from Ennius,
“ Et melior navis quam quae stlataria
portat.'’ Heinrich, in a long note on this
Scholium, adopts and supports the Scho-
liast’s explanation.

136. amethystina :]
cloaks of violet colour. Martial mentions
them (i. 97) : “ Amethystinasque mulierum
vocat vestes? ‘ Vendit' means ‘ gets him
his price.'

138. Sedfinem impensae] Heinrich con-
siders this verse to be spurious [and Rib-
beck] It certainly is out of place. Two
hundred sestertii were about a guinca and
a half. As to ‘annulus’ see i. 28, 11.

141. an tibi servi Θείᾳ] These ‘servi '
are connected with ‘sella,' as ‘comites'
belong to ‘ togati! The clients must know
whether the lawyer has a chair behind him
when he goes out and humble companions
walking before him (‘ deducentes‚' see note
on Hor. S. i. 9. 59), and whether his chair
is carried by the largest number of hearers,
which was eight. So I believe doctors who
keep their carriage are counted cleverer than

The Maedi were a mountain

These are other

those who do not, and they who drive two
hol-ses better than those who drive one. As
to ‘togati ' see S. i. 96; viii. 49: and as
to ‘ sella' see i. 64. n.

143. Paullus agebat Sardonyche,] He
hired a valuable ring to plead in, to get
himself the reputation of being rich. And
he succecded‚ it appearS‚ while the more
honest men (lid not. The names are un-
known. P. and some MSS. and old editions
have Gallus for Cossus. Jahn has that
name. There is a Basilus below, x. 222.
Mothers, wives, sisters, and children used
to be brought forward as a means of soften-
ing the hearts of the ‘judiees.’ (See Cic.
pro Flacco, c. 42, Long's note.) The cus-
tom was common among the Greeks, and
persons so introduced into court were
called παράκλητοι. Most MSS. have ‘de-
ducere,' but ‘ producere³ is the only right
word. P. has it.

148. Gallia vel potius] Juvenal says
if he thinks himself eloquent, he had better
go to Gaul, or to Africa the nursing mother
of lawyers, if he has put a price upon his
tongue, that is, if he wants to make money.
Juvenal says in another place,· “Gallia
causidicos docuit facunda Britannos '' (xv.
111). The commentators say that the
provinces Gallia and Africa (Libya) were
prone to litigation. If so, it was probably
through the introduction of these lawyers
that they became so, as the natives of India
have become more litigious since the su-
preme courts were established. Two of the
most celebrated orators of the imperial
