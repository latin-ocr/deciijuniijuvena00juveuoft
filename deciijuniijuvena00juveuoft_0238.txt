188 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA VIII.

INTRODUCTION.

THE vice of aristocratic pretension is here represented with moderation and good sense.
There is no idle dcclamation against hcreditary honours, but 1118 blindness of men
belonging to an exclusive class, whose claims to distinction were founded upon the
11181113 of the great and good of former generations and unsupported by any personal
merits of their own, is shown 111 language which no one can object to, and reasoning
which admits of no answer. The nobility of a man’s ancestors, he says, only holds a
torch up to his shame if he live unworthily of 1118111. Τ118 111018 exalted is the guilty,
the more conspicuous is his guilt. The only true nobility is virtue, and 1118 virtuous
noblemau is 3 nobleman indeed. The racc-horse, if he show no signs of his descent, is
set to grind or draw a cart. Among the despiscd plebeians there are those who have
great gifts and virtues, and have rendered great services to the nobility and to their
country. These are the commonplaccs of the Satire, which also exposes some of the
particular vices among the patricians of the day, among which were gambling, keeping
low company at taverns, a passion for driving and for the stables, acting in public,
hiring themselves for gladiators; but above all gross maladministration in the
provinces, against which Juvenal takes paius 1ο cantion his friend, Ponticus, to whom
the Satire is addressed in the form of an Epistle. He is one of the class against
whose degenerate members the Satire is directed3 and we may suppose he was a
young man with what we should 8311 good prospects. Ι think a real person must
have been meant, and that the poem is not a mere declamation. Heinrich inquires
whether the subject was suggested by real life 01 1118 11181011831 38110013, and thinks
the poem was drawn from both sources. There was enough 111 ·real life to suggest
it, as there would be still and perhaps more; aud we need not, Ι think, go 1ο 1118
38110013 for its inspiration. The pride of birth aud the degeneracy of inherited nobility
were not new features of society in J uvenal's time, and they have not grown so old
in ours but that generations to come will complain as he did, and pour contempt,
as 118 (11(1 1101, on the inheritanee of noble names, however virtuous their possessors
may be.

There are some severe lines on the Emperor Nero (211—226), and the Satire was
written after his time, as the context shows 3 but how long it 13 impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

What use are pedigrees, ancestral blood, statues and images, and noble names, if in
the face of our great ancestors we live amiss-—gambling all night and going to bed
at dawn, when they were up and marching? What joy has Fabius of the
Allobrogcs' victor, of the great altar, of his descent from Hercules, if he be covetous
a fool, effeminate, if he bring shame on his rough ancestors, turn poisoner, and
disgrace his house? Line your whole house with images, yet still virtue alone is true
nobility. Be Paullus, Cossus, Drusus in your morals, and give them place before your
images, ay, and your own lictors too. First I claim the goodness of your heart: be
holy, just, in word and deed, and then I count you noble. Hail, Gaetulicus, or what-
soever stock you come from, your country may be proud of you, and all may cry 33
they do who have found Osiris. What man is generous if he be unworthy of his
racc, illustrious only for his name? We call a dwarf an Atlas, an Aethiop a swan,
