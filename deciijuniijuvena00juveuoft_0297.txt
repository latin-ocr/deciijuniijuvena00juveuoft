Plurima suntjuvenum discrimina : pulcrior ille
Hoc, atque ille alio ς multum hie robustior illo :
l'na senum facies, cum voce trementia membra
Et jam leve caput madidique infantia nasi.

Frangendus misero gingiva panis inermi.

Usque adeo gravis uxori natisque sibique,

Non eadem vini atque eibi torpente palato
Gaudia z nam coitus jam longa oblivi03 vel si

Coneris, jacet exiguus cum ramice nervus,

Et quamvis tota palpetur noete jacebit.
Anne aliquid sperare potest haee inguinis aegri
Canities ? quid, quod merito suspecta libido est

Quae Venerem affectat sine viribus.

Aspice partis

Nune damnum alterius: nam quae cantante voluptas, 210
Sit licet eximius citharoedus sitve Seleucus,

Et quibus aurata mos est fulgere lacerna?

Quid refert magni sedeat qua parte theatri,

Qui vix cornicines exaudiet atque tubarum

Quem dieat venisse puer, quot nunciet horas.
Praeterea minimus gelido jam in corpore sanguis

that even monkeys get wrinkles when
they grow old ς a simple remark. Per-
haps he did not know they get grey and
look as like an old woman os their own
eolour as one animal can be like another.

202. 'Ut captatori] See v. 98, n. Cossus
may be any body. He was not easily thrown
out in his profession, but this old gentle-
man is described as so wearisome that even
Cossus finds it hard work to come near
him. He is a burden to himself as well as
to every one else.

204. noan] He means that he says no·
thing of other pleasures long since for-
gotten. ‘ Ramex’ is hernia or piles' (vi.

2g9. Aspice partis Nunc damnum] He
goes on to speak of the deafness of age.
After ‘ cantante ’ (which word is used for
instrumental as well as vocal music) ‘ cith-
aroedo’ must be supplied. P. has it in-
stand of ‘ citharoedus,' and Jahn [and Rib-
beck] have it too (see below, v. 253, n.).
Seleucus must have been some famous
fliuger or musician, or actor, but lie is not
known now. As to the fine ‹li-esses worn by

the tragic actors and musicians on the
stage, sce note on Hor. A. P. 215: ‘¹ luxu-
riem addidit arti Tibicen traxitque vagus
per pulpita vestem.”

214. vix cornicines exaudiet] Homs aud
trumpets were sounded at the beginning
and the end of games and playS, as Lipsius
has shown (Saturn. ii. 19). ‘ Exaudire' is
to hear when there is some obstruction, or
from a distance, &a See Long’s notes on
Cic. in Cat. i. 85 iv. 73 pro P. Sulla 10.

216. Quem dicat venissepuer,] The ser-
vant must bawl out the name of a visitor,
and if he comes in to tell his master what
o'clock it is he must shout. The hour he
would learn from the public sundial (sola-
rium) or water-clock (clepsydra).

217. Praeterea minimus] His body is
eold, his blood is scanty, and never gets
war-m except with fever, and all the diseases
iu the world dauce about him like a chorus
of spectres. ‘ In ' is wanting in some few
MSS. between ‘jani' and ‘corpore,’ and
Ruperti on second thoughts has omitted it.
The Latin requires it.
