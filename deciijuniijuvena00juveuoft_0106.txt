Non matrona Laris, non filia virgo, neque ipse

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

110

Sponsus levis adhuc, non filius ante pudieus.
Horum si nihil est, aviam resupinat amici.

Scire volunt secreta domus atque inde timeri.
Et quoniam coepit Graecorum mentio, transi

Gymnasia atque audi facinus majoris abollae.

used for a drinking-cup and a washing-
basin. It seems here to bc used sor a more
homely vessel‚ which 0110 rich man at least,
if Martial says truc (i. 38), chose to have
of gold or gilt. The Scholiast and emn-
mentators are divided in respect to the in-
terpretation. The decent one may be thus
given, “if with upturned bottom the golden
goblet smacks 3 '' that is, if the great man
drinks off a large bumper at a draught and
smacks his lips as if he had done a great
thing. I am afraid this version will not do
in connexion with what goes before. John
of Salisbnry in his quotation substitutes (or
the writer of his Ms. had done so) the fol-
lowing 11110 for this, “Quod proferre palam
11011 possit lingua pudica,'' which shows
what his notion of the meaning was. It
also shows that the eeclesiastics of the mid-
dle ages altered parts that they did not like,
a remark Heinrich makes on ii. 109 above.

110. ZVon matrona Laris,] ‘Laris' means
‘ a man’s house,' as “inopemque paterni
Et laris et fundi.” (Hor. Epp. ii. 2. 51.)
‘ Sponsus ³ was 0110 who was betrothed to a
woman, as ‘’sponsa was a woman who 1105
betlothed to a man. A youth could not
contract marriage till he had ceased to be

ί111111111105, ³ the time of which was not
strictly defined, but was generally taken to
be fourteen. But a contract of marriage
might be made after seven, and a child
might so be ‘ sponsus.' By a law passed in
the time of Augustus a girl might not be
betrothed till she was ten, the age of pu—
berty being twelve from the earliest times.

113. Scire volunt secreta domus] This
is given as the reason for their intimacy
with the women of the house, that they
might get the master’s secrets out of them,
and 50 11ον0 him in their power (v. 57).
[Ribbeck omits ‘ Scire volunt ' to ‘ Graeco-
rum mentio.']

114. transi Gymnasia] It is doubted
whether this means, as the Scholiast says,
‘pass by,' that is, ‘say no more of the
gymnasia, and let 115 go on to a crime of a
larger sort 3 ’ or, whether, as Lubinus sup-
poses, ‘let us pass on to the schools, and
epeak of a crime committed by one of your

greater pliilosophers,’ as if it were ‘transi
ad gymnasia.’ And this is a legitimate
construction, as in Plautus (Stich. iii. 1. 3) 2
“ Ego per hortum amicam transibo meam.”
Heinrich takes it this way, and so (10 Gran-
gaeus and others, and I agree with them.
’1110111111050111101550110015 w er e called‘ gy m-
nasia' because they commonly held them
in buildings er ected for gy mnastic exercises.
‘Crimen majoris abollae’ the Scholiast says
was a proverb:‘ ‘Quasi majoris togae, id
cst, sceleris potiorisss’ He adds, “vel per
ironiam dixit quasi sanctioris philosophiae.''
The origin of the saying‚ I think, must re-
main doubtful. It means in some way or
other a greater crime. ‘Abolla,’ which 15
derived from ἇμβολλά, a form of ἀναβολή,
15 used in the next Satire (v. 76), and then
it is worn by a senator. It was probably
used indiscriminately for the outer gar-
ment worn out of doors, whether ‘lacerna,'
‘ pallium,' or whatever it might be, or the
military ‘ sagum.’ Some suppose ‘ majoris
abollae‚' to be equivalent to ‘ duplice panno '
in Horace, which was the dress of the
Cynics (see note on Epp. i. 17. 25), and
this is against this interpretation, for he
goes on immediately to say the man was a
51010.

116. Stoicus oceidit Baream] Servilius
Barea Soranus was proconsul of Asia in
the reign of Claudius, and a man of high
character. He fell under the displeasure
of Nero, and was charged with treasonable
practices, and his daughter Servilia with
aiding him. They were condemned to
death. The chief witness against them was
P. Egnatius Celer, whom Tacitus (Ann. xvi.
32) speaks of as “ cliens Sorani et tunc
emptus ad opprimendum amicum:'’ and he
adds: “auctoritatem Stoicae sectae prae-
ferebat, habitu et ore ad exprimendam
imaginem honesti exercitus, ceterum animo
perfidiosus, subdolus, avaritiam ac libidinem
occultans.” The man was afterwards, in
Vespasian's reign, charged with this offence
by Musonius Rufus, and was condemned to
death. Rufus speaks of him as “ perditor
corruptorque amici, et cujus se magistrum
ferebat ς ” which explains ‘ discipulum,' and
