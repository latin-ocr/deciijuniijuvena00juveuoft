D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Mense quidem brumae, quum jam mercator Iason
Clausus et armatis obstat casa candida nautis,

Grandia tolluntur crystallina, maxima rursus

155

Murrina, deinde adamas notissimus ct Bernices
In digito factus pretiosior : hunc dedit olim
Barbarus incestae, dedit hunc Agrippa sorori,
Observant ubi festa mero pede sabbata reges

in negative sentences have something of
an adversative sense. See note on Horace,
C. ii. 12. 9: “ Tuque pedestribus Dices
historiis proelia Caesaris?

153. Mense quidem brumae, quum] Ru-
perti and Jahn have ‘quo' after P. and
several MSS. M. and many others and most
of the old editions have ‘ quum ’ or ⁶ cum.'
¹ Quo ' probably arose from the omission of
the usual mark in ‘quo' for ‘ quom.³ The
Saturnalia, or festival of Saturnus (see v. 1,
n.), was held at Rome in December, from
the 17th to the 23rd inclusive. The three
first days were properly the Saturnalia ; the
next two were called Opalia, the festival
of Opis, wife of Saturnus ς and the last two
Sigillaria, a fair, so named from the little
figures (sigilla) which, among other things,
were sold as toys and presents. The fair
was held, as ours are, in booths 3 and the
Scholiast on this place says the principal
place was the Porticus Argonautarum,
built and dedicated to Neptune by M.
Agrippa in honour of the naval victories of
Augustus, probably after the battle of Ac-
tium, in which he himself commanded.
On the walls were fresco paintings of the
Argonauts. (See Hor. Epp. i. 6. 26. n.)
This explains the meaning of Juvenal here.
‘ Mense brumae ³ is December 3 ‘ mercator
Iason Clausus: &e means that the pictures
of J ason and his armed sailors were shut in,
or excluded from view, by the booths (casa
candida) which filled the ‘porticns.' All
the old commentators and the translators
take the passage differently, and but for the
note of the Scholiast the meaning would be
very obscure. They suppose Jason to be
any merchant; ⁵ casa eandida: a house
covered with snow ,- ‘ armatis nautis?
sailors all ready for sea; and the meaning
of the whole to be that when the winter
has set in and voyages are dangerous, “the
wauton dames of Rome would make their
husbands put to sea to fetch vanities,” as
Holyday expresses it 111 1115 note. All this
is quite beside the meaning, and is more-
over nonsense.

155. Grandia tolluntur crystallina]
Cups and other vessels of coloured glass

were common, though some of these were
of great value, as we may judge from the
Portlaud Vase in the British Museum.
But those of pure transparent crystal were
very eostly. Pliny (H. N. xxxvii. 2) men-
tions a lady in his time (and she not rich)
having given 150,000 sesterces (HS. cmm),
nearly 1200l. sterling, for one drinking cup.
The ‘murrhina,' or ‘inurrhia, vasa’ were pro-
bably the same as Chinese porcelain, though
it 11005 not seem to be certain. (See Bec-
ker’s (11111115, p. 25, n. 21, Metcalfe'sAbridg.)
Pliny (l. c.) says it came from the East. He
also mentions Nero having paid 300 talents
for a small cup, more than 70002. (see be-
low, vii. 133.) Pliny speaks of one porce-
lain cup as holding three sextarii, about
three pints. ‘ Tolluntur ' is generally under-
stood to mean that she carries them off.
Heinrich says she takes them up in her
hand to admire them. If so, she means
her husband to buy them. But the other
is better.

156. adamas notissimus] The diamond
has always been the most costly of precious
stones. Pliny says it is the dearest thing
that exists, not only the dearest stone3
“Maximum in rebus humanis non solum
inter gemmas pretium habet adamas³³ (H.
N. xxxvii. 4). In his time there were six
sorts, among which he gives the first place
to that of the East Indies. Berenice's name
is familiar to us as the sister of that King
Agrippa before whom St. Paul defended
himself (Acts xxv.). They were son and
daughter of Herod Agrippa (grandson of
Herod the Great), whose death was the
punishment of his blasphemy (Acts xii).
Agrippa was presented by Claudius (Ad).
48) with the sovereignty of Chalcis, in
Syria, on the death of his uncle Herod, to
whom Berenice was married. When her
husband died she lived with her brother,
and there are stories of their having carried
on incestuous intercourse. His govern-
ment was afterwards transferred to that
part of Syria which had been the tetrarchy
of his great uncle Philip, and he then
received the title of king. What follows
