xxvi INTRODUCTION.

Ὀδοιπορικά ⁴, and a few verses for the wife of Thrasea, on her mother
Arria, who had killed herself before her husband ⁵. All these Cornutus
advised his mother to destroy. then his book was published, men
began forthwith to admireand to seize upon it ⁶. [He died ofa disease
of the stomach in the thirtieth year of his age ⁷. But8 afterwards, when
he had left his school and teachers, having read the tenth book of
Lucilius, 110 conceived a great desire to write Satires. The beginning
of that book he imitated ⁹, first intending to abuse hhnself', and after-
wards every body, which he did with such invectives against the modern
poets and orators, that he even attacked Nero, the reigning emperor.
The verse 110 wrote against Nero was as follows:

‘Auriculas Asini Mida rex habet,’

but it was corrected by Cornutus in the following way:

‘Auriculas Asini quis non habet P’

lest Nero should think it was said against himself.'’]

Persius then, as he has always been called in modern times rather
than by his cognomen, Flaccus, by which his contemporaries knew him,
was of equestrian rank, and was born at Volaterrae (volterra), 111
Etruria, on the 4th of December, A.D. 34, the twenty-first year of
Tiberius. His father Flaccus died when he was six years old, and he
remained under the care of his mother Fulvia Sisennia at his native
place, where he went to school till he was twelve years old ². Like
Horace, he then was taken to Rome and sent to a grammar and a rhetoric
school, the former being under the management of one of the most cele-
brated teachers of the day, Remmius Palaemon ³, the other of Virginius
Flavus, a rhetorician of eminence, who was afterwards exiled by Nero ⁴.
He took the ⁶ toga virilis ⁹ at sixteen, the usual age, and according to
custom left school and went, as we should call it, to a private tutor, L.

⁴ “ Ὀδοιπορικῶν librum unum.'' See below.

⁵ 1. 0. before her husband killed himself. See below.

⁶ ‘ Diripere.' See note on J uv. vi. 404, “ quis diripiatur adulter.”

⁷ This contradicts the other statement, that he died ΑΛ). 62, that is, near the end of

his twenty-eighth year. This clause is not from the original, but added by the eom-
piler in ignorance.

⁸ What follows is out of order, and probably made up by the compilor.

⁹ See note on S. i. 1.

¹ The Scholiast on v. 1 says, “ semetipsum redarguit, quod ipse reliquit carmina, quae
vulgus lecturum nor. sit, quoniam non sunt vulgaria, et quod minime conveniant robusto
ingenio et libidini.'’

2 The beginning of A.D. 47, 'Jth of Claudius.

³ See Juv. S. vii. 215.
