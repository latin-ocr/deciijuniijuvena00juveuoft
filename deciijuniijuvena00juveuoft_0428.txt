Persius means any reference here to Nero
Ι do not believe.

36. [As-sensere viri:] This is in the Epic
vein. ‘Nunc ’ is ‘ after this) ‘ Cippus'
is the monumental stone 011 which was the
inscription, of which several are preserved
in the British Museum and elsewhere. On
the ‘cippus' was often engraved s.T.T.L.
for ‘ sit tibi terra levis,’ and that was one
of the common ‘ formulae ' in taking leave
of the dead. [Fabi-etti, Inscript. Antiq„
δια, Romae, 1699, pp. 284, 285, 286, gives
examples of monumental inscriptions which
0011111111 this formula sometimes at full
length, as for example, “Optamus cuncti
sit tibi terra levis.”]

40. nimis uncis ZVarz'buS indulges :]
Horace speaks of one 115 “ minus aptus
acutis Naribus horum hoininum,'’ not
suited to the sharp critics of the day (S. i.
3. 29), and of one Balatro “ suspendens
omnia nas0,'' who sneered at every thing
(S. ii. 8. 64). He also has “ Ad haec ego
naribus uti Forniido‚” ‘ 1 am afraid to
answer with a sneer’ (Epp. i. 19. 45).
See below, v. 118. ‘Ait' refers to no one
in particular: “ says one.’' ‘ Recuset’ is
used in the sense of ‘ neget ’ as below (48).
Jahn says ⁵ velle recusare. ³ is stronger than
‘ nolle.' 1 do not know what he under-
stands by ‘recusate ‘Os populi' is an
ordinary periphrasis for fame, made pro-
verbial by Ennius, “volito vivus per 0111,
virum.'’ ‘Velle meruisse' is to wish one
had done something to earn ; ‘velle
linquere' is to wish one may leave.
J ahu says we should expect ‘ merere?
1 think the perfect is wanted. As to

‘cedro' sce Horace, A. P. 331, “spe-
ramus carmina fingi Posse linenda cedro.''
Cedat· 011 was used for prcserving books
from insects, and they were kept, Casan-
bon says, in cedar boxes and sometimes
bound in cedar wood. Pliny (H. N. xiii.
13) says the preservation of the books of
Numa was accounted for by their being
smeared with cedar oil. Vitruvius (ii. 9)
says “quae unguuntur cedrio ut libri a
tineis et carie nonlaeduntur.” ‘Scombri'
are mackercl. On this line see J uv. xiii.
116, n. and Marti-al iii. 2 (to his book),
“Ne nigram cito raptus in culinam Cor-
dylas madida tegas papyro.” ‘Cordylae '
were young ‘ thynni?

45. Non 090 eum scribo] “ Occasionally
in order that it may have great emphasis
‘non' is placed at the beginning of a sen-
tence, or at the beginning of a predicative
part of a sentence, and in these cases it
often becomes difficult to give a translation
which shall not greatly alter the order of
words'' (Key, L. G. 1403). Where ‘non’
occurs with the personal pronoun it com-
monly precedes it, as here and in S. iii.

'7 8, and twice together in Horace, Epp. i.
19. 37, sqq.:

“Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor
Impensis coenarum et tritae munere
vestis,
Nonl ego, nobilium scriptorum auditor et
u tor,

· Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita

dignor.''

Such cases are common in Horace. Pro-
fessor Key notices S. i. 6, “Non quia,
