SATIRA xl.

Aemula Picenis et odoris mala recentis,

Nec metuenda tibi, siccatum frigore postquam

Autumnum et erudi posuere pericula succi.
Haec olim nostri jam luxuriosa Senatus

Coena fuit.

Curius parvo quae legerat horto

Ipse focis brevibus ponebat oluscula, quae nunc

Squalidus in magna fastidit compede fossor,

80

Qui meminit calidae sapiat quid vulva popinae.
Sicci ‘terga suis, rara pendentia crate,

Moris erat quondam festis servare diebus

Et natalicium cognatis ponere lardum,

Accedente nova, si quam dabat hostia, carne.

when they were gathered, but the juiee of
autumn, which was considered uuwhole-
some, had been dried out of them by the
frost. It was now April. The construc-
is ‘ nec metuenda tibi sunt mala postquam
posuere autumnum siccatum frigore et pe-
ricula crudi succi.’ ‘ Put away their au-
tumn' is an odd expression, but it is ex-
plained by what follows. ‘Postquam’ is
‘now that they have.'

77. jam luxuriosa] then it had grown
to be luxurious. It was plain enough, but
a stin simpler diet had gone before in the
good old days when M. Curius Dentatus
(ἰὶ. 3. n.) cooked his own herbs, such as the
ditcher with the heavy chain on his leg
would now-a-days turn up his nose at.
(See note on ‘ ergastulass S. vi. 151.) The
man remelnbers the flavour (a pretty
strong one of garlic and such like) of the
good things he got at the eating-house
while he was in the ‘familia urbana? See
note on Hor. S. ii. 7. 118: ‘⁴ accedes opera
flffissrffinssifflassssnssfietssnssofiffi ἰ’ῃέἶὶῑῖὶὲ
urbis desiderium-'³ The matrix of a preg-
nant sow, or one that had lately cast its lit-
ter, was counted a great delieacy. As to the
‘ popinae ' see above, viii. 168, 11. Valerius
Maximus, whose work Juvenal seems to
have known well, says the Samnite ambas-
sadors found Curius “agresti in scamno
assidentem foco atque ligneo catillo coenan-
tem, quales epulas apparatus indicio est ”

iv. 3. 5).

( 82. Sicci terga πίθῃ] Ηο says the chine
of bacon (S. vii. 119) dried on a hurdle
in the ceiling, was formerly kept to bc pro-
duced on holidays or birthdays. ‘ Rara

crate ’ is a frame with wideinte1·stices like
‘ rara retia ² in Hor. Epod. ii. 33. The an-
cient Romans did not offer bloody sacrifices
on birthdays‚ but this rule ceased to be
observed in later times. See note on Hor.
C. iv. 11. 8: “immolato Spargier agno.''
When the ancient practice was discontinued
is uncertain, but perhaps Juvenal is not
strictly accurate. All but the legs and en—
trails ofa victim were eaten. The birthday
lard was for moistening the vegetables per-
haps: “ Uncta satis pingui ponentur olus-
cula lardo '’ (Hor. S. ii. 6. 64). ‘ Moris ’
is the possessive genitive. “ It belonged to
the custom of former times.'’ Caesar says
in like manner, ‘⁴ Est autem 1100 Gallicae
consuetudinis,'’ &c. (Bell. Gall. iv. 5.)

86. Coynatorum aliquis] This plain per-
son is of good family and is visited 011 his
birthday by oue of his relations, who has
been thrice consul, not only with the title
which in J uvenal’s time was sometimes
borne without the office (S. vii. 186, 11.), but
with the command of armies in the field,
and moreover he has been dictator. The
great man comes early to dinncr‚ shoulder-
ing the spade with which he has been dig-
ging. V. 89 is a picture. ‘ Solito matu-
rius ' means that he leaves his work earlier
than usual to honour his relation’s birth-
day or holiday, not “ for so rare a treat '’
(Mayor), nor as Ruperti puts it “ ut lar—
gius diutiusque genio indulgeret et quia.
ingeni 1 cupiditate tam delicati cibi ardebat:
τρεχέδειπνος (111. 67).” The Scholiast says
“ aute horam nonam,'' which was the usual
hour in Rome (below, v. 205), but such
rules did not goveru the country people.
