shutting himself up to compose it, vile
stuff not fit for decent ears. ‘Tandem ³
means that the man has been long prepar-
ing his verseS, and comes at last to the ex-
pected day. As to ‘ sardonyche,' see J uv.
S. vi. 382, n.; vii. 144. This man wears
a ring that 110 reserves for bi1-tl1‹layS‚ the
gayest holiday the Romans kept. ‘Plas-
ma ' for a gargle or mixture for sostening
the throat, occurs in Quintilian (Inst. i. 8),
“ Sit lectio non 111 canticum dissoluta nec
plasmate, nt 1111110 3 plerisque fit, effemi-
nata.’' “Patratio est rei venereae per-
fectio vel consummatio, unde et patres
dicti 00 quod patratione peracta filios pro-
creant.” These 310 the Scholiast's words,
aud he refers to J uv. vii. 241, “ oculosque
in 11110 trementes.” This is all the expla-
nation we are likely to get. The word
is not found elsewhere. ‘ Fractus' is here
applied to the eye as Juvenal (ii. 111)
applies it to the voice. J uvenal speaks of
‘ trementes oeulos' for laseivious eyes in S.
ii. 94. Each of these words, ‘patranti,'
‘ fraetus,³ ‘ocello' (which diminutive refers
10 1110 contraction of the eye), expresses
the author's meaning. [Jahn 1135 ⁶ Sede
legeDS‚’ ‘collueris,' and a comma after
‘ ocello.’]

20. Ivyentes irepz'dare Titos‚] He is
deseribing the effects of lascivious verses
upon wauton ears. ‘ Ingentes Titos ' seems
to be an imitation of Horace's ‘ celsi Ram-
nes ’ (A. P. 342). The Ramnenses, Ti-
tienses, and Luceres, were the three cen-
turies of Equites formed by Romulus, and
as Horace uses the first, 50 Persius here
uses the second for the great people in
general, whom 110 represents as listening to
this filthy stuff. ‘ Neque more probo ³ re-
fers 10 their lewd gestures, and ‘nec voce
serena' to their loud applause of those parts
in particular which were most exciting.

In v. 21 111051 MSS. and editions have
‘ ubi.' There is authority for ‘ut‚’ which
Heinrich adopts to avoid the 01151011. This
is not a sufficient reason I think.

22. sz’, vetula] “What you, old sin-
ner, turn purveyor for the ears of others ?''
He supposes the man to be old in vice, if
not in years, and to write for no other pur-
pose than to tickle the 5011505 of the profli-

ate.
g 23. quibus et dicas cute perditus, ohe l]
‘ 0110 l' ‘ ohe jam l’ ‘ ohe jam satis 1' were
common exclamations, all meaning ‘that's

enough? See note 011 Hor. S. ii. 5.
96 :—
“Importunus amat laudari, donee ‘ohe
jam!’
Ad caelum manibus sublatis dixerit,
urge,
Crescentem tumidis infla sermonibus
utrem.''

Persius may have had this in mind. ‘Cute
perditus ³ properly applies to a dropsieal
person. It is not meant 11101311)Υ 11010, but
is 1110 531110 35 Horace's ‘ crescentem utrem,'
a belly blown out by flattery, the applause
of the listeners. I do not know what Jahn
means by saying “ translatum est ad sum-
mam animi et judicii perversitatem.'' The
personal pronoun ⁴ tu ' is omitted here
though emphatic, ‘even you? Some in-
stances are given on Hor. C. iii. 1¹7. 5,
“Auctore ab illo ducis originem.” See
below, v. 56.

24. Quo didicisse, nisi hoc· fermentum]
This is the supposed answer of the poet.
“ What 15 the use of learning if this leaven
and all that is born 111 3 111311 15 not to burst
from his livor like a wild fig—tree (from a
1011111) ?'' This common use of ‘quo' is
noticed on Juvenal viii. 9, “ Effigies quo tot
bellatorum ;” and xv. 61, “ Et sane quo tot
