O proceres censore opus cst an haruspice nobis?
Scilicet horreres majoraque monstra putares,

Si mulier vitulum vel si bos ederet agnum !
Segmcnta ct longos habitus et llamca sumit,

Arcano qui sacra ferens nutantia loro

O pater Urbis,

Sudavit clipeis ancilibus !

marriage n contract was signcd, which was
called ‘sponsalia’ (vi. 25). The tahlets on
which it was written were called ‘legitimae
tabulae' (vi. 200). ‘Dictum Felicitcrl'
means that the usual form ofcongratulation
was gone through. lt was usual for the
bridegroom to give a supper on the day of
his marriage, at which there was always
more or less licentiousness. Sec note on
Hor. S. ii. 2. 59. ‘ Coena’ is put for the
guests at the ‘coena.' Iu the ordinary
arrangements of a triclinium the ‘imus
lectus’ was occupied by the host and his
family, and the wife reclined next to her
husband. See Hor. S. ii. 8. 20, n. Hence
Ovid says (Amor. i. 4. 5, 35) to a married
woman:

“ Alteriusque sinus apte subjecta fovebis Ρ
Ιῐῄίοὲθῐ 0011οὲ11111 volit ille mgnum 'r'
Nec premat indignis sinito tua colla la·
Mitceedttzhs’in rigido pectore pone caput.”

121. Oprocere8,] He eries out to the
nobles to condemn one of their own set,
and asks whether this monstrous conduct-
requires the censor's branding or to bc
looked into by the haruspices, that they
might declare how it must be expiated.
‘ But doubtless you would be more shocked,
and count it a more frightful omen (re-
quiringtbe intervention of the “ haruspex’')
if a woman gave birth to a calf or a cow to
a lamb? The ‘ haruspices’ were persons
whose profession it was to declare the will
of the gods by the consulting of entrails and
in respect of signs and prodigies. There ap-
pears to have been a ‘ collegium ' of them,
as of the augurs, under the empire. They
were an inferior body to the augum, whose
business was properly connected with the
omens derived from the flight of birds. In
‘ censore ³ Heinrich sees another allusion to
Domitian (see above, vv. 29, 63). Ι think
he strains this point.

124. Seymenta et longos habitus] He is
indignant that Gracchus, who was one of
the Salii, priests of Mars, should have
taken to wearing female ornaments and

dress.

means ribands, fringes‚ flounces, and so
forth. See Ovid de A. A. iii. 169:

“ Quid dc veste loquar Ρ nec vos, segmenta,
requiro,
Nec quac his 'l'yrio murice, lana, ru-
bcs.”

The women wore the ‘ stolae corresponding
to the men's ‘ tunica,' down to the fect, and
being made longer than the person it was
fastcned up in folds above thc waist (Hor.
S. i. 2. 29, n.). ‘Flameum ’ or ¹ flannncuin'
was a veil, usually worn by brideS. See
note on v. 116, and below on vi. 225.
The veil is said by Verrius Flaccus and
Festus to have had its name from the wives
of the ‘ flamines ’ (flaminicae), who wore it
alwayS, as a sign that their marriage could
never be dissolved. Others derive it from
‘flainina‚' as being of a red colour; but
Pliny (H. N. xxi. 8) says it was yellow;
and Lucan (ii. 361) has “ Lutea demissos
velarunt flamea vultus,” The MSS. vary,
but the old editions all have ‘ flamen? The

‘Segmcntaff as applied to dress,

‘ ancilia ’ were twelve shiclds sacred to
Mars, of which eleven were said to have
been made by Numa in exact imitation of
one which in his reign was supposed to
have been sent down from heaven. The
‘Salii' were twelve priests„ one to each
‘ancile,' who, on the Kalends of March,
carried them through'the city with songs
and dances. (Hor. C. iv. 1. 28, n., and
Epp. ii. 1. 86, n.) The shields were struck
with rods in tune with the dance, and hung
to the neck with a leather thong, which is
here called ‘ arcanum' or mystic‚ an epithet
belonging properly to the shield itself. The
shields are described as ‘ nutantia: swaying
about with the motion of the daneers, who
found it hard work it seems. They lived
too well.

126. Opater Urbi-53] This is explained
by ‘ Gradivus ' below. 'rhat name belonged
to Mars, according to Servius (on Virg. Aen.
iii. 35), when angry. Because it is said to
be derived from ‘ gradior,' Holyday rather
absurdly renders it ‘ Great Marcher.' The
derivation cannot be this. The word in-
