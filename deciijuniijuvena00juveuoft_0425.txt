SATIRA I.

375

Elevet‚ accedas, examenve improbum in illa
Castiges trutina, nec te quaesiveris extra.

Nam Romae quis non—at si fas dicere—sed fas
Tunc cum ad canitiem et nostrum istud vivere triste

Aspexi, ac nucibus facimus quaecunque relictis,

Cum sapimus patruos 3 tunc, tunc ignoscite.——-“ Nolo.”-—
Quid faciam? Sed sum petulanti splene cachinno.
Scribimus, inclusus numeros ille, hie pede liber,

8. Nam Romae quis non] [Jahn has
‘Nam Romae est quis non ἶν’ uc'—] We
need nothe at any pains to supply what
Persius meant to say. He meant to say
nothing and has said it very expressively.
What follows is not more complete or less
intelligible. “ For at Rome who is not—
and‚ if I may say it—nay 1 may, when I
look to our gray hairs and that ill-tempered
life we live, and all we do from childhood,
savouring of our uncles—then, then pardon
me—‘I will not’ answers the friend. Then
what am 1 to do Ρ But my spleen is saucy
and I am prone to laugh.'' ‘ Sed' antici-
patae the advice his friend would give him,
to hold his tongue. Heinrich makes Per-
sius say ‘Nolo,' meaning he would rather
not do it, but he cannot help himself.
‘Quid faciam' he puts in a parenthesis,
comparing iii. 26, “quid metuas ?” ‘Si
fas dicere—sed fas' is like εἴ μοι θέμις,
θέμις δὲ τάληθῆ Λέγειν (Soph. Frag. Inc.
14, Dind.). ‘Canities’ is like ‘ senectus’ in
Horace (Epod. xiii. 5), “ obducta solvatur
fronte senectus.” It means a sour fault-
finding habit, which is also expressed in
‘ triste ’ and ‘patruos' The Scholiast
quotes Cicero, who defending Caelius says
of L. Herennius the prosecutor “fuit in
hac causa pertristis quidam patruus, cen-
sor, magister '' (c. 11). Horace repeatedly
uses ‘ patruus ' in the same way (C. iii. 12. 3,
“patruae verbera linguae ;'' S. ii. 2. 97,
“Iratum patruum, vicinos, te tibi iniquum 3³³
ii. 3. 88, ‘⁶ ne sis patruus mihi”). Uncles
and stepmothers were equally proverbial.
Jahn andex-stands ‘ canities ’ as a premature
old age brought on by all manner of profli-
gacy. ‘Istud ' has reference as usual to what
had been said by the other, and shows
that ‘triste' means the unfair criticism with
which the writer had been threatened. The
use of the infinitive ‘vivere’ isin aecordance
with the nature of that moed, which repre-
sents a neuter substantive (Key’s L. G.
1232). We have ‘ scire tuum ’ and ‘ ridere
meum' in this Satire (27, 122). Horace
(Epp. i. ’1. 27) has three instances close to-
gether:

“Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere deco-
rum, et

Inter vina fpgam Cinarae moerere pro-
tervae.

The Greek use of the article (τὸ ζῆν) illus-
trates this sense of the infinitivo.

10. nucibus . . relictis] Nuts were a
common means of amusement with boys.
(See Hor. S. ii. 3. 171.) ‘ Nuces relinquere ’
is quoted by Erasmus as a proverb ; mean-
ing (as he explains it) “ omissis studiis et
nugis puerilibus ad graviora magisque
seria converti.'’ Akin to this he says were
‘nunquam a nucibus 1·ecedere‚' ‘ redire
ad nuces‚' ‘nuces intermittere? ‘nucibus
indulgere,' ‘ nuces repetere?

12. petulanti splene cachinno] On
‘ splene ’ the Scholiast says “Et hoc secun-
dum physicos dicit, qui dicunt homines
splene ridere, felle irasci, jecore amare,
corde sapere, et pulmone jactari‚'' where
‘jactari’ means pride. Servius on Virg.
Aen. vi. 596, says the same as to lust,
mirth, and passion, and on viii. 219, he re-
peats it quoting this verse of Persius.
¹ Cachinno,’ a laugher, is formed from
‘ cachinnus,' as ‘gluto‚' a glutton (v. 112),
from ‘ glutus,’ the throat, ‘ popino‚' ‘ ganeo,'
διο. The termination expresses one addicted
to any thing.

13. Scribimus, inclusus] “ We shut our-
selves up and write (one verse, another
prose), something grand for the lungs, most
bountiful of breath to puff and blow.'’
[Jahn has ‘ Scribimus inclusi.'] He goes
on to describe a man reciting his produc-
tions (see Juv. i. 1, n.; vii. 39, sqq.),with his
hair smoothed and trimmed, his toga fresh
cleaned, with his best (birthday) ring on,
sitting on a raised stool, his throat well
garg-led, and a leer in his eye, showing the
lewd character of his composition :—

“ His eye a comment to his sense affords,
And adds lascivious looks to luscious
words.” (Brewstcr.)

‘ Scilicet haec‚’ ‘ and this forsooth‚’ means
what the man has taken such pains with,
