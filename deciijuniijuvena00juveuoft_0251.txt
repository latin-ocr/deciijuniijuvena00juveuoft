SATI ΒΑ VII I.

201

Forsitan imbelles Rhodios unctamque Corinthum :

Despicias merito.

Quid resinata juventus
Cruraque totius facient tibi levia gentis?

115

Horrida vitanda est IIispania, Gallicus axis
Illyricumque latus : parce et messoribus illis,

Qui saturant Urbem Circo seenaeque vacantem.
Quanta autem inde seres tam dirae praemia culpae,

Quum tenues nuper Marius discinxerit Afros?

120

Curandum imprimis ne magna injuria¹ fiat

Fortibus et miseris : tollas licet omne quod usquam est
Auri atque argenti, scutum gladiumque relinques

Et jacula et galeam : spoliatis arma supersunt.

Quod modo proposui non est sententia : verum

written to the same effect before. Mauso
judged vv. 110, 111 to be spurious. Ru-
perti agrees with him, and Jahn encloses
these verses in brackets. They are not
wanting in any MSS. or old editions. The
tautology is not like Juvenal; and the part
that Heinrich objects to, or ‘ nam sunt haec
maxima? 1'nay be spuriouS, but it is not as
bad as he makes it. [Ribbeck omits vv.
111—126 as spurious.]

113. Forsitan imbelles Rhodios] The
luxurious and vicious character of the Corin-
thians is well known. See note on Horace,
Epp. i. 17. 36, “Nou cuivis homini eon-
tingit adire Corinthum.'’ Juvenal gives the
Rhodians the epithet Horace applies to the
Tarentinos (Epp. i. 7. 45). They were good
seamen however. Stephanus Byzantius ex-
plains Κορινθιάζεσθαι as τὸ ἑταιρεῖν ἀπὸ
τῶν ἐν Κορίνθῳ ἑταιρῶν· ἢ τὸ μαστρο-
πεύειν (to act the bawd), and he refers to
Aristophanes’ lost play, Κώκαλος.

114. Quid resinata juventus] Resin was
used for smoothing the skin as the rough
stone mentioned above (v. 16). He says
these effeminate nations may be despised
and plundered, for what can such as they
do to revenge or defend themselves Ρ But
the man who looks for plunder had better
not go to Hispania,Gallia‚ Illyricum, Libya,
for there he will find a different sort of
people, ‘Axis ’ is not uncommonly put for
a region of the sky, and then for a country
(see Forcell.). ‘ Latus ² is used for the sea-
coast, as in Ovid (Her. x. 61): “Omne
latus terrae cingit mare.’'

118. Qui saturant Urbem] He is speak-
ing of the Africans, who supplied the
greater part of 'the corn imported into
Rome. ‘Qui saturant Urbem’ means that

125

they fill the bellies of thc citizens, whom hc
describes as wasting their time in the circus
and theatre, as to which see note on S. iii.
223: “Si potes avelli Circensibus.’' He
sayS, “ Resides, if you did oppress these
poor people, what return could you expect
to get from them now that Marius has
stripped them so effectually ἶν’ ‘Autem ’
may here be rendered ‘besides'
Marius see S. i. 47, n.

As to
⁸ Discinxerit ’ is
used as we use the word ‘strip.’ Porcel-
lini gives three interpretations out of
which wc may choose: (1) he compelled
the Africans to lay down their arms; (2)
he robbed them to their very clothes ; (3)
he robbed them of every thing but their
purse (which was commonly carried in
the girdle). This is idle.

122. Fortibus et miserim] He means
that it is not well to do any great wrong to
those who are at once brave and poor
(miseris), for if you take their money they
will use their arms. ⁴ We know that while
people have any thing to lose they will
bear a great deal of injustice. Jahn pro-
nounces v. 124 spurious. We might stop
at ‘ relinqueS,' and the inference would be
as clear as it is now, but there is not
sufficient reason for rejecting the verse.
P. and other MSS. and Heinrich have
‘ relinquens.’

125. non est sententia .·] He means it is
not what we eall a saw, a commonplacc.
Quintilian says: “ Proprie sententiae vocan-
tur quas Graeci γνώμας appellant, utrum·
que autem nomen ex eo acceperunt quod
similes sunt consiliis aut decretis ” (Inst.
Or. viii. 5, init„ where there is much more
about ‘ sententiae '). Seneca (Controv. lib.
i. Praef. sub fin.) speaks of ‘ translatitiae‚’
