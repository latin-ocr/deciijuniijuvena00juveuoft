Archigene.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid enim velocis gloria plantae

Praestat ct esuriens Pisaeae ramus olivae?

Ut sit magna tamen certe lenta ira deorum est.

the Scholiast says, on which Schurzfleisch
observes, “Germanum ex Germanismo

long, corresponding to the Greek form ᾗ,

neighbourhood of which abounded in helle-
bore, the supposed remedy for insanity,
see Hor. S. ii. 3. 83: “Nescio an Anti·
cyram ratio illis destinet omnem.” Erasmus
quotes as a Greek proverb correspondiug to
‘ Archigene eget ' Ἀσκληπιοῦ δεῖσθαι.

99. Pisaeae ramus olivae ἕ] The plain
of Olympia in which the Olympio games
were held was very little west of the
town of Pisa in Elis, and the names are
sometimes confounded. It was at these
games both the Ladae on record won their
prizes. His success eost one. of them his
life. The braneh of the olive which, as
before mentioned, was used for the crowns
at Olympia (viii. 2·. ’,6 n.‚) ιῘι1ι91131 calls

‘hungry' because it bore no fruit.

τῆρες ὑστερόφθοροι (1131191074). See other

it probable he may have remembered Se-
neca's sentence (Contr. lib. v. Praef.):
“Sunt dii immortales lenti quidem sed
certi vindices humani generis,'' quoted by
Grangaeus. As to ‘diadema’ see viii.
259, n. It is not hard to find cases in

as far as Romulus.

They think also they can get pai-don when-

ever they please for asking, and so they
put off the asking; and few think other-
wise than that their own day of account is
some way off. To make a lottery of
wickedness and trust to prizes turning up
and risk the fatal blank is common enough.
Solomon, who understood these mattffl-‚s

work is not executed speedily, therefore
the heart of the sons of men is fully setin
them to do evil ’³ (Eecles. viii. 11). When
the heart is “ trepidum formidine culpae‚'’
trembling with fear of its own great gunt,
it. would seem the shortest and easiest
course to abandon it : but it is more con-
venient to argue away such fear than to
put away the cause of it. Juvenal knew
what he was writing about.

107. sacr‘a ad delubra vocantem] “If you
misti-nst him and bid him come to the tem-
ple and swear by the altar, he will go there
before you, nay will be the first to challenge
you to go there, and will abuse and perhaps
strike you for doubting his honesty.'' ‘ Tra-
here ² is not ‘ trahere in jus,' as Ruperti says.
There is nothing here about legal proceed-
ings. The offended liar taking the character
of injured innocence is anmsinglyillustrated
in Falstaff. ‘Superest ' means ‘is added t0,‘
not ‘ abounds‚’ as Mr. Mayor says, and ‘to
press ' which he gives for ‘vexare' has no
meaning. 6 Fiducia ³ is confidence in a good
sense, confidence in his own honesty.
[Ribbeck has given the true interpretation
of ‘ superest.' Gellius informs us (i. 22)
that a misuse of the word ‘ superest' came
into fashion‚ as in the expression ‘hie illi
superest,' ‘this is that man's advocate?
On some occasion the praetor in reply to
an advocate who said ‘ ego illi supersum’
wittily retortcd, ‘ tu plane superes, non
ades: a joke difficult to translate 3 but he
meant to say that the advocate was quite
useless, for he was not doing an advocate’s
duty (adesse). Juvenal, according to Rib-
