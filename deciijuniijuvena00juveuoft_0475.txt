Luciferi rudis, exclamat. Melicerta perisse

Frontem dc rebus.

Tibi recto vivere talo
Ars dedit? et veri speciem dignoscere calles,

1113

Ne qua subaerato mendosum tinniat auro ἶ)
Quaeque sequenda forent quaeque evitanda vicissim,
Illa. prius creta, mox haee carbone notasti Ρ

Es modicus voti, presso Lare, dulcis amieis?

Jam nune astringaS, jam nune granaria laxes,

110

Inque luto fixum possis transcendere nummum,
Nee gluto sorbere salivam Mercurialem?

“ Haec mea sunt, teneo,'’ cum vere dixeris, esto
Liberque ac sapiens praetoribus et Jove dextro :

Sin tu, cum fueris nostrae paulo ante farinae,

115

Pelliculam veterem retines, et fronte politus
Astutam vapido servas sub pectore vulpem,
Quae dederam supra repeto, funemque reduco.

whose name was changed to Palaemon.
⁶ Frons ' stands for ‘ pudor.' Juvenal speaks
of “populi frons durior '’ (1·111. 189), and
asks “Quando recepit Ejectum semel at-
trita de fronte pudorem ?” (xiii. 242.)
Forcellini refers to Horace, Epp. ii. 1. 80,
“ Clament periisse pudorem Cuncti paene
patres'' [‘ exclamet,’ Jahn, Heinrich].
101. Tibi recto rivere talo] The con-
nexion is this. No man must profess to
be what he has not learnt how to be. ‘ You
then profess to be a free man; but have
you learnt to walk uprightly, to distinguish
truth when you see it, to be sure there is
not 111-1155 11111101· the gilding, to set the right
marks on good and bad, to moderate your
desii-es, to live within bounds, to be kind to
your friends, to join liberality with pru-
deuce, and to be indifferent to money ?'
⁸ Recto talo ' Horace uses, Epp. ii. 1. 176,
“an recto stet fabula talo.'’ ‘Ars ' is here
equivalent to ‘ ratio,’ philosophy. For · spe-
ciem ’ many MSS. have ‘ specimen‚' which
Jahn adopts. 1 do not know what he makes
of ‘ ne quii? ⁸ Mendosum tinniat ’ has
been notit-ed above, v. 25, n. Horace asks
whether certain extravagant people are
“sani creta, an carbone, notandi '³ (S. ii. 3.
246). In 110 there is the notion of libe-
rality without recMessness, there being a
time to shut the granary door as well as to
open it. The subjunctive, ‘ πει-11101153
‘laxes,' has a potential sense here. ‘l'he
Greeks would use ἂν with the optative, or
oros εἶ with the infinitive. As to the coin
dropped in the mud and sticking to the

pavement, which the Scholiast here says
was a common trick with 11055, see note ou
Hor. Epp. i. 16. 64, “ In triviis fixum qui
se demittit ob assem.'' ‘ Gluto,’ a glutton,
is formed from ‘glutus‚’ the throat, like
‘cachinno’ (i. 12, n.) froin ‘cachinuus.'
The man is asked whether he cau pass
a piece of money on the road without
feeling his mouth water like a good fecder
when he sees a good dish. 'she ‘ saliva ’ is
called Mercurialis because it is excitcd by
Mercurius, the god of wiudfalls. So the
people called the lucky Damasippus Mercu-
rialis (Hor. S. ii. 3. 25).

115. nostrae paulo (mle farinae,] ‘ Ea—
dem fa1·ina,' bread made of the same meal,
is a proverbial expression, like ἓν κήριον,
1101105 from the same comb, πάντα μία
κόνις, all come to the same (lust. These
proverbs are all to be found, with com-
ments, in Erasmus' collection. What
Persius 51155 is, ‘But if 5011 who profess-ed
but now to be of our sort (a free man),
still keep to 50111· old nature and are only
fair outsidc, then 1 take back the conces-
sion l made above, and ‹lraw in the rope.'
As usual, there is a good ‹leal of confusion
in the metaphors: there is the fleur, the
snake shedding its skin, the smooth fore·
head, thc fox in a vnpid brcast, and the
drawing 111 of a rope, in which the com-
mentators see an allusion to u gaure played
115 11055. 'she Scholiast says it is “ad me
habenas licentiae quas dederam traho, dum
libertatem quam tibi concesseram adimo.''
1 think this is the meaning.
