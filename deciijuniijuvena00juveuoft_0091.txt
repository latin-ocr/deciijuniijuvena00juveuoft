SATIRA ΙΙ.. 41

Quid Cremerae legio et Cannis consumpta juventus,

Tot bellorum animae, quoties hinc talis ad illos
Umbra venit? Cuperent lustrari, si qua darentur
Sulfura cum taedis et si foret humida laurus.
Illuc heu miseri traducimur! Arma quidem ultra

north of Rome flowing into the Tiber.
From this point they carried on war with
the people of Veii for two years, aud were
finally surprised by them and cut to pieces.
The number of men the Romans lost at
Cannae, including their consul Paulus (v.
146) and many of their best officers, is said
to have been about eighty thousand.

156. Tot bellorum animae‚] This is an
unusual sort of expression. It cannot
mean ‘tot animae bellatorum,' as Ruperti
{13³¹ the· mggitng Ὲῖοῗξεῗυὲθ ofbgiimgtiltiy
wart-„³ that is, which have known so many
wars. He says they would ask to be purified
if such a degenerate spirit came near them,
provided there was at hand sulphur and
pine branches, and a wet laurei bough.
‘ Lustratio’ or purifying was performed in
a multitude of matters by the Romans when
pollution had been or might have been
contracted, and consisted usually in sprink-
ling water by means of a branch of olive or
laurei, and carrying round the object burn-
ing sulphur or pine torches, besides the sa-
crifice of a victim. 'h'bullus (i. 2. 61) says,

“ Et me lustravit taedis, et nocte serena
Co111Jceigsit„ ad magicos hostia pulla

Servius, on Aen. vi. 229,

‘⁸ Idem ter socios pura circumtulit unda,
Spargens rore levi et ramo felicis olivae,
Lustravitque vir0s,”

says ‘circumferre’ is equivalent to ‘pur-
gare:' “nam lustratio a circumlatione dicta.
eet vel taedae vel sulphuris.'’ Ovid‚ de-
scribing the lustration of flocks at the Pa-
lilia (Fa-st. iv. 739), says,

“ enei-ulei fiant vivo de sulfure fumi,
'Factaque fumanti sulfure balet ovis.”

159. Illuc heu miseri traducimurl] ‘To
this point, poor wretches, are we brought
und changed ς ’ that is, to what follows The

expression is like Horace’s “Nimirum hic
ego sum,'' Epp. i. 15. 42: “ne fueris hic
tu,” Il). i. 6. 40. The Greeks used ἐκεῖσε,
ἐνταῦθα in the same way. ‘ Traducere’ is
used for changing‚ bringing over from one
state to another, as Ovid. Met. xv. 483:
“gentemque feroci Assuetam bello pacis
[Ribbeck has ‘si foret
Heu miseri traduci-
mur!' but it is not easy to see what sense
he gives to ‘traducimur-2]

160. Litora Juvernae] This is the form
of the name given by Ptoleniy (Geog. ii.
2), who calls one of the tribes Ἰουέρνιοι, and
the island Ἰουερνία, a form of the native
name. Ierne, Iverna, Hibernia, are others.
Agricola had thoughts of taking the island,
which he told Tacitus could easily be done
with oue legion and a few auxiliaries, but
there is no evidence that the Roman legions
ever entered it ; but mercatores probably
had been there, and from them Ptolemy
may have got some of his knowledge of the
island. It was in the year Aa). 82, the year
aster Domitian’s accession, that Agricola
turned his attention to Ireland. (Tac. Agr.
24.) The Orkneys and Shetland Islands
(Orcades) were first discovered and taken
possession of by Agricola when he sailed
round Britain in the last year of his govern-
ment, A.D. 84. (Tac. Agr. c. 10). The
Satire, therefore, could not have been
written before that year, or many years
aster it, for he says ‘ modo captas.’

161. minima contentos nocte] So Ta-
citus says (Agr. c. 12), “ Dierum spatia
ultra nostri orbis mensuram et nox clara et
extrema Britanniae parte brevis, ut finem
atque initium lucis exiguo discrimine in-
ternoscas.'’

163. et tamen unus] ‘The barbarians we
conquer do not the gross things we do, and
yet if they come to Rome evil communica-
tions soon corrupt them likewise, as was
the case with the Armenian hostage!

164. Armenius Zazata] This is a name

traducit ad artes.”
umida laurus Illic.
