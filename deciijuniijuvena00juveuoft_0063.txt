Hos animos? Neque euim loculis comitantibus itur

Ad casum tabulae, posita sed luditur arca.

Proelia quanta illie dispensatore videbis

Armigcro !

Simplexne furor sestertia centum

Perdere et horrenti tunicam non reddere servo 2³
Quis totidem erexit villas, quis fereula septem

no better, who takes ‘ hos animos' sor ‘hos
Romanos: or proposes ‘ potius ' to change
‘hos' into ‘haec‚’ and to explain it thus:
⁴¹ Quando alea haee, i.e. talis, ut nunc est 3
talis aleae cupiditas animos, homines, sc.
cepit.'’ ‘ Habuit’ is easily supplied, as the
Scholiast suggests, The verb is often
omitted in such questions where there is
indignation, as below (vi. 611) :

‘⁸ Tune duos una, saevissima vipera, coena Ρ
Tune duos Ρ Septem, si septem forte fuis-
sent-'³

Juvenal says elsewhere (xiv. init.) that
fathers taught their young children to game.
The ‘alea’ was always ‘ vetita legibus'
(Hor. C. iii. 24. 58), but never checked from
the deelining times of the republic. Augus-
tus (vit. c. 70, 71), Caligula (c. 41), Clau-
dius (c. 33), and Domitian (e. 21), are all
put down as gamblers by Suetonius ; and
Claudius wrote a treatise on the subject.
Compare S. viii. 10: “ Effigies quo Tot
bellatorum, si luditur alea pernox Ante
Numantinos Ρ ”

89. Neque em'm loculis comitantibus]
He says men do not now go to the gaming
table with their purse aud play for the eon-
tents of that, but stake their chest contain-
ing all the ready money they had. ‘ Tabula’
is the board on which the dice were thrown.
As to ‘ neque enim‚’ see Key’s Lat. Gr.
1449: “ ‘ Enim ' must commonly be trans-
lated by the English conjunction ‘ for‚' but
at times retains what was probably its ear-
lier signification, ‘indeed‚'as in ‘enim vero,’
indeed, indeed ; ‘neque enim‚’ nor indeed;
‘ et enim‚' and indeed, &c.; τις, ‘ Quid tute
tecum? Nihil enim' (Plana). ‘What are
you saying to yourself ? Nothing, 1 assure
you.' ’' For ‘ ad casum ' one MS. of the
fisteenth century quoted by Ruperti, and
two editions of the same century, Calderini
and the Leipzig, have ‘ ad eausam! M.
has that word in the text, with ‘casum' in
the margin. ‘ Causam ' has no meaning.

91. dispensatore videbis Armiyero !]
‘Dispensator' was the eash-keeper, called
also ‘ procurator ’ aud ‘ calculator,' who
formed one of the establishment iu all rich
houses. He is called ‘armigero ’ because

he surnished the sinews of this warsare, the
money : “ L⁷tpote qui ludenti domino num-
mos subministret '³ (Britannicus). Gran-
gacus says the 'arma’ in ‘armigero’ arethe
(lice, as below (xiv. 5), “parvoque eadem
movet arma fritillo.'’ This is wrong, Ι
think.

92. Simplexne furor sestertia centum]
The Greeks would say ἁπλῆ μανία, inad-
ness and nothing more. Heinrich explains
it “ non simplex furor, sed duplex vel tri-
plex‚” which may be right, though l prefer
the other. Taking the ‘sestertium' at the
value in our money of 7l. 16⁸. 3d., a huu-
dred ‘ sestertia' would be 781l. 58. The Ro-
mans did not understand high play if this
was enough to make a satirist angi-y: but
the more than madness lay in the seltishness
of the man who (as Heinrich explains it)
after losing all his money stakes his slave’s
jacket, and losing that also never restores
it. The commentators compare Persius (i.
54), “ Scis comitem horridulum trita donare
lacerna:” but ‘reddere ' means here to re-
store, and is never equivalent to the simple
form ‘dare.'

94. Quis totidem erexit vinna] This
reminds us of Horace’s complaint more
than a century earlier (C. ii. 15) :

“ J am pauca aratro jugera regiae
Moles relinquent.—-—
—— Non ita Romuli
Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis
Auspiciis veterumque norma.”

See Lipsius, De Magn. Rom. lib. iii. c. 14.
As to ‘fereula' see Hor. S. ii. 6. 104, n.
‘ Seereto' only means ‘ by himself? as Virg.
Aen. viii. 670, “secretosque pios? A
couple of courses was enough for the old
Romans according to Servius on Aen. i. 729.
“ For some ages the Roman nobility com-
monly used nothing but ‘far' and ‘puls‚’
and if a marriage or other joyful feast fell
out, they thought it a mighty thing if they
added a few small tishes and a few pounds of
pork '’ (LipsiuS, De Magn. Rom. iv. 5).
Suetonius gives Augustus eredit for mode-
ration and good taste combined, because his
custom was ordinm-ily to have but three
courses, aud athis finest dinners only six
