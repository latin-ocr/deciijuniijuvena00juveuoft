Esquilias a ferventi migrare Saburra.

Ille dolor solus patriam fugientibus, illa
Moestitia est, caruisse anno Circensibus uno.
Sanguinis in facie non haeret gutta : morantur

Pauci ridiculum fugientem ex Urbe Pudorem.

Experiere hodie numquid pulcherrima (lictu,
Persice, non praestem vita vel moribus et re,
Sed laudem siliquas occultus ganeo, pultes
Coram aliis dictem puero sed in aure placentas.

Nam quum sis conviva mihi promissus habebis

Evandrum, venies Tirynthius aut minor illo

(S. v. 77). As to Suburra see iii. 5. It was
a close hot part of the town. Mr. Mayor
renders ‘ferventi' busy, following the
Scholiast, who says “qui a Saburra fre-
quentissima regione ad Diocletianas mi-
gret, ubi est solitudo.”

53. Circensibus] S. iii. 223: “Si potes
avelli Circensibus.'' ‘Sanguinis in facie
non haeret gutta’ is like “vultumque
modesto Sanguine ferventem ’³ (x. 301).

55. Pauci ridiculum suyientem] He
says few now care to stay the flight of
Modaety, who is only laughed at as she
leaves the city; on which Grangaeus says
“immo ex orbe.'' The allusion is the
same asin S. vi. 19, 20:

‘⁴ Paullatim deinde ad superos Astraea re-
cessit
Hac comite, atque duae pariter fugere
sorores,”

where ¹ hac' is Pudicitia (see note). The
common reading is ‘effugientem ε’ some
MSS. have ‘et‚' the interpolation of which
Ι have no doubt led to the compouud
form, instead of ‘fugientem,’ which ap-
323²ss [ilnffiiffiless‘iisiffissssdssiff {lita
Mayor omits it, nor does he follow Jahn
in 57, but has ⁸ vel moribus.'

56. Experiere hodie] He comes now to
the ostensible purpose of his epistle, and
invites his friend Persicus to dinner. That
name we have had before (iii. 221). [Rib-
beck has discussed this Introduction vv.
1—55 (Der Echte &c. Juvenal, p. 83,
&c.)‚ and he condemns it.] ‘Numquid'
is the same as the Greek εἴ τι. ‘ Vel' is
exegetical, ‘in my life or (that is) in my
character and in action.’ A few MSS.
and Jahn [and Ribbeck] have ‘nec.’
Jahn [and Ribbeck] follow the Scholiast
against the MSS. in reading ¹ si ’ for ‘sed’

in 58. Iu both places Hermann deserts
Jahn. ‘Siliquae’ are husks of any sort
of leguminous vegetables. But see note
on Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 123: “vivit siliquis et
pane secu11(lo;’' aud Pers, iii. 55: “sili-
quis et grandi pasta polenta.’' ‘Puls’ is
gruel or porridge made of ‘fars It was
the common food of the early Romans.
‘l’ulmentaria’ (Hor. Epp. i. 18. 48) were
sauces of later invention to flavour the
‘ puls.’ See S. vii. 185. The word is used
in the plural number by the poets only.
See below, xiv. 171. ‘Placentae’ were
cakes sweetened with honey. “ Pane egeo
jam mellitis potiore placentis '³ (Hor. Epp.
i. 10. 10 .

61. Biandrwm venies Tirynthius] Her-
cules was called Tirynthius from Tiryns,
a town of Argolis, vawhere he was said to
have settled by command of the Pythian
oracle. Evander, when he received Aeneas
as his guest in his homely palace on the
Palatine (as it was, afterwards named),
addressed him thus, according to Virgil
(Aen. viii. 362) :

Haec limina victor

Alcides subiit ; hace illum regia cepit.

Aude, hospes, contemnere opes et te
quoque dignum

Finge deo, rebusque veni non asper
egenis.'’

 

Aeneas was the ‘minor hospes,’ but in
virtue of his mother Venus he is said
‘contingere sanguine caelum? Aeneas
was killed in battle with the Rutulians
near the river Numicius: but the legend
said he was drowned in that river. Her-
cules, unable to bear the tortura caused
by the robe Deianira gave him, went to
the top of Mount Oeta, in Thessaly, and
there burnt himself to death, or while the
pile on which he lay was buming, he was
