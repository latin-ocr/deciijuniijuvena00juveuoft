D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Afferat: aut longos castrorum ferre labores
Si piget et trepidum solvunt tibi cornua ventrem

Cum lituis audita, pares quod vendere possis

200

Pluris dimidio, nec te fastidia mercis

Ullius subeant ablegandae Tiberim ultra,

Neu credas ponendum aliquid discriminis inter
Unguenta et corium. Lucri bonus est odor ex re

Qualibet.

Illa tuo sententia semper in ore

205

Versetur dis atque ipso Jove digna poetae :
Unde habeas quaerit nemo, sed oportet habere.”
Hoe monstrant vetulae pueris repentibus assae 3
Hoc diseunt omnes ante alpha et beta puellae.

legio consisted of thirty ‘ manipuli‚' and in
each ‘manipulus' there were two centu-
rions. The ‘ decima cohors ’ was the
lowest, and the centurions in that were at
the bottom of the list. The title ‘primipi-
lus ’ continued after the division of the
legion which gave rise to it was (liscon-
tinued.

199. solvunt tibi cornua ventrem] This
is a ludicrous way of expressiug sear. Most
MSS. have ‘trepido‚’ which Achaintre has
edited. P. and most editors have the accu-
sative. The ‘ cornu' and ‘ lituus’ are com-
monly opposed. They were both curved,
and the ‘ lituus' was used by the cavalry.
See note on Hor. C. i. 1. 23, and C. ii. 1.

“ J am nunc minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures, jam litui strepunt.’'

‘ Pluris dimidio ' is a common way of speak-
ing like the little frog’s answer to her
mother, “major dimidio ’² (Hor. S. ii. 3.

2())1. nec te fastidia mercis] This is ex-
plained by what follows. The man says to
his son “ don't turn up your nose at any
kind of vva-res though they have to be sent
beyond the Tiber, or think it necessary to
make any difference between pei-fumes and
Tanning and other work of an
offensive kind must be carried on beyond
the river.

204. Lucri bonus est odor ex re Qua-
libet] This the commentators illustrate by
the following story told of Vespasian by
Suetonius (c. 23): “Reprehendenti filio
Tito quod etiam urinae vectigal commentus
esset, pecuniam ex prima pensione admovit
ad nares, sciscitans ‘ num odore offendere-
tur :’ et illo negante, ‘Atqui (inquit) e
lotio est.'” The ancients tried metal by

the smell. So Martial (ix. 60) has “Con-
suluit nares an olerent aera Corinthon.'’
The case would be more in point if the
subject were not taxation. If the morality
of commerce is to rise no higher than
the morality of taxes it will stand very
low. VVitness the tax on professional in-
comes.

206. dis atque ipso Jove digna poetae .·]
This way of speaking, where a general term
is followed by a particular which is involved
in it, is very common in Greek and Latin.
It is uncertain what poet Juvenal gets his
verse from or whether he gives the words of
the poet οι· adapts them. A like sentiment
is quoted from a tragic poet (apparently)
by Seneca (Epp. 115) : “Non quare et
uude : quid habeas tantum rogant.” P. has
‘ poeta' to agree with ‘ J ove.’ Jahn, Her·
mann, [and Ribbeck] have ‘poeta.'

208. vetulae pueris repentibus assae ;]
‘Assus ’ is ‘ dry,’ and ‘ assa nutrix ’ is ‘ a
dry nurse‚' as the Scholiast explains it here.
“Nutricula sicca vetusta infantibus mon-
strat '' is the form of the Scholium, but
‘ sicca ’ and ‘ vetusta ' are probably only
glosses upon ‘assa.' (See Forcellini.) The
MSS. have various readings. P. and some
others and the Scholias't have that of the
text. Lubinus, Henninius‚ and some other
old editions have the same, which is that of
the modern editors. ‘ Poscentibus assem ³
is the reading of most MSS„ for which some
have ‘ repetentibus? This has probably
come from the true word ‘repentibus‚' and
‘poscentibus ' has been substituted as a.
more appropriate word than ‘ repetenti-
bus.'

209. Hoc diseunt omnes] The girls were
taught the same lessou before they began to
read. Horace says of this learning (Epp.
i. 1. 54):
