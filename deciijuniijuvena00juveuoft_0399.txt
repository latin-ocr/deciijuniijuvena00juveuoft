SATIRA XV.

:5 [a

Saltatus nigro tibicine, qualiacunque

Unguenta ct flores multaeque in fronte coronae ;
Sed jurgia prima sonare
Incipiunt animis ardentibus;

Hinc jejunum odium.

hacc tuba rixae.

Dein clamore pari concurritur, et vice teli
Saevit nuda manus ε paucae sine vulnere malac;
Vix cuiquam aut nulli toto certamine nasus 55

Integer.

Aspiceres jam cuncta pcr agmina vultus

Dimidios, alias facies et hiantia ruptis
Ossa genis, plenos oculorum sanguine pugnos.
Ludere se credunt ipsi tamen et pucriles

Exercere acies, quod nulla cadavera calcent z

Et sane quo tot rixantis millia turbae

may be referred to the same subject ι “ inde,
scil. ex ebrietate, saltatus cet„ hinc, ex
eadem-jejunum, h. e. infirmum odium (viri-
bus ebrietate fractis) proficiscebatur.’' To
this nonsense he adds that the other ex-
planation is better. ‘ Qualiacunque ' he
says is ‘ cujuscunque generi5‚' ⁶ no matter of
what kind3' “ etiam hoc ebriis convenit.
Non designatur vilitas unguentorum, quae
in Aegypto pretiosissima erantss’ If he had
ever been in an Oriental crowd he would
have known what Juvenal means when hc
says ‘ perfumeS‚ such as they are.' Their
scents like their music are offensive to the
senses of Europeans. The Egyptians had
the single and double flutes like those of
the Greeks and Romans, but much longer ς
they called them sebi, which like ‘ tibia ’
meant the leg bone. They were played by
women more commonly than men. Dancing
was usual on religious occasions, and men
as well as women joined. lVilkinson gives
information on this subject and on Egyp-
tian music,with engravings, in his Aue. Eg.
vol. ii. 223, sqq.

51. Sed jurgia prima] ‘Sed ³ is used
as above, v. 38. Aster- a description or
digression it is common. ‘Tuba rixae’
is like ‘ prooemia rixae’ in iii. 288. They
shout words of abuse, and this is the
trumpet that calls to battle. ‘ Animis
ardentibus ' is mock heroic, ‘ with hot
contage?

57. Dimidios, alias facies] As to ‘dimi-
ffios' see above, v. 5. It does not only
mean ‘ broken off.’ There is ‘ dimidium
crus’ (xiii. 95) for a broken leg. ‘Alias
facies ' for ‘ altered faces' is like ‘⁴ Dices
hen quoties te speculo videris alterum ''
(Hor. C. iv. 10. 6).

61. Et sane quo tot rixantis] “The
people think this is only child's play, and
they are right ; for what is the use of such
thousands of fighters if none of thern are
killed ?'’ There is humour in this. ‘ Quo '
is used as in S. viii. 9, “Effigies quo Tot
bellatorum,'' where see note. ‘Saxa in-
clinatis per humum quaesita lacertis ' ex-
presses the way in which they stoop to
pick up the stones while they keep an eye
upon the enemy all the time. Stones he
says are the usual weapons for squabbles
where townspeople fall out among them-
selves. ‘Domestica’ means such as they
were familiar with. He alludes in what
follows to Virgil, Aen. xii. 896, sqq.:

“ Nec plura effatus saxum circumspicit in-

gens,

Saxum antiquum, iugem, campo quod
forte jacebat,

Limes agro positus litem ut discerneret
arvis.

Vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent

Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora
tellus ς

Ille manu raptum trepida torquebat in
hostem.”

Ajax threw a great stone at Hector (Il. vii.
268), and Diomed, as Juvenal says, hit
Aeneas on the hip with a stone that a
conple of men of unhcroic days could not
lift, ὃ δέ μιν ῥέα πάλλε καὶ οἶος (11. v.
304). Homer lived probably not many
generations aster the. Trojan wur. The race
of giants was growing less even in his day.
But the strong nien before Troy were
nothing to those Nestor knew in his youth
(11. i. 271), and so it goes on. The past
is seen through n mist, and all things gono
