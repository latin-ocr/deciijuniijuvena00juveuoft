Qui partem acceptae saeva inter vincla cicutae

Aeeusatori nollet dare.

Plurima felix

Paullatim vitia atque errores exuit omneS‚
Prima docet rectum Sapientia ς quippe minuti

Semper et infirmi est animi exiguique voluptas

Ultio 5 continuo sic collige, quod vindicta

Nemo magis gaudet quam femina.

Cur tamen hos tu

Evasisse putes quos diri conscia faeti
Mens habet attonitos et surdo verbere caedit,

Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum?

Poena. autem vehemens ac multo saevior illis,

Quas et Caedicius gravis invenit aut Rhadamanthus,
Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.

Hymettus, greater and lossor, is the range
that bounds the plain of Athens on the
SE. The honey for which it was famous
got it the epithet ‘ dulcis.’

According to Bentley’s rule noticed above
ou v. 44, ⁴ que' should be ‘ ve? But the
MSS. are unanimous.

187. Plurima felix] He says, “ Philo-
sophy is the means of happineSS, and by
degrees divests us of the greater part of
natural defects and all our faults of judg-
ment J 'twas she first taught us right from

belongs to ‘flagellum.’ who Caedicius
was it is impossible to say. The Scholiast
tells us he was a courtier and most cruel
satellite of Nero.

199. Spartano cuidam respondit] This
story is put by Herodotus (vrso) into the
mouth of Leotychides the Spartan in an
address to the Athenians. He warns them
against breaking their saith by relating
the fate of one Glaucus who bore the high-
est reputation for honesty in all Sparta.
A man of Miletus came to him and said,
that in consequence of his reputation for

wrong, for certainly it's only dwaffed, in· just dealing he vwished to deposit half his

firm, and little minds that love revenge ;
which you may gather straight from this,
that no one likes it better than a woman.”
‘ Minutns ' is a participle, and had better
licre be rendered as such. ‘ Vitia' are
faults of nature 'some of which cannot be
cradicated. ‘ Errores’ correspond to ‘ cul-
pas,' and are faults of practice. See Ho-
race, S. ii. 6. 7 : “Nec sum facturus vitio
culpave minorem.” As to ‘Sapientia’
see v. 20, n. There is no necessity for a
cmlij9u2¹ic222351iictiaeuf¹ffgse lines are very
vigorous. He says, “But suppose you
must have revenge, why should you think
they escape whom conscience keeps in fear
and always under the noiseless lash?''

(See xiv. 306.) He here begins to illus-
trate what he said in the first four lines.
As to ‘ tortor’ and ‘flagellum' see vi. 474,
n. On ‘surdo’ see S. vii. 71. Heinrich
takes ‘occultum’ with ‘caedit.' But
· surdo ’ expresses enough, and ‘ occultum’

fortune with him. Glaucus accepted the
dcposit and promised to restore the money
to any one who should produce certain
tokens and claim it. This the man's sons
afterwards did, but Glaucus professcd to
have forgotten an about the matter and
required four months to refresh his me-
mory ς this time he employed in consulting
the oraclo at Delphi as to whether he
might not keep the money and swear ‘he
had never received it. The answer of the
oracle was conveyed in seven hexameters
dcnouucing dreadful punishment on the
breaker ot oaths; and Glaucus begging
pardon of the god paid the money. ’1116
priestess did not let him go without a
wholesome warning, saying, τὸ πειρηθῆναι
του θεον καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι ἴσον δύνασθαι, he
who temp ts God is as bad as he who does
the wickedness which it is in his mind to
do. Leotychides winds up his story by
snying that Glaucus had not one descend-
ant left, but his whole house was extinct,
