D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Idaean gamos are going on. The praetor, victim of his horses, sits as a conqueror in
triumph; all Rome (the multitude must pardon me) has pourcd into the Circus, and
by that shout 1 know that Green has won the day. For had it not you might have
seen the city all in mourning as on that day of Cannae. Lot boys go look at games,
boys who can shout and bct and sit by girls they love. Lct my shrunk skin drink in
the sun, aud put thc toga off. To-day an hour erc noon you may go bathe: you
must not do so every day of the six, for even such alife as that would pall. Pleasnres

are sweetcr for unfrequent use.

Amans eximie si coenat lautus habetur,

Si Rutilus demens.

Quid enim majore cachinno

Excipitur vulgi quam pauper Apicius P Omnis
Convictus, thermae, stationes, omne theatrum

De Rutilo.

Nam dum valida ac juvenalia membra 5

Sufficiunt galeae dumque ardens sanguine, fertur
(Non cogente quidem sed nec prohibente Tribuno)

1. Atticus eximie εἰ coenat] Atticus was
the cognomen of many persons of high
family aud distinction under the empire.
The name might be proverbial for wealth
from the enormous fortune of T. Pompo-
nius Atticus, the friend of Cicero. Rutilus
is a cognomen found in several families,
both patrician and plebeian. The owner
of it here had run through his fortune.
‘ Lautus ’ is here a munificent person who
lives well, but has means in proportion
(see below, v. 22). ‘ Excipitur ⁹ means ‘is
taken up,' as we say. As to ApiciuS, see
iv. 23, n. [Ribbeck places vv. 1—55 at
the bottom of his page.]

4. Convictus, thermae, nationes] In all
companies there is talk of Rutilus. ‘Lo-
quuntur' is understood. ‘Convictus’ is
equivalent to ‘ convivia’ here, and in other
writers of the empire (see Forcellini).
‘Thermae' are the baths, where a great
deal of gossip went on (Hor. S. i. 4. 75, n.:
“In medio qui Scripta foro recitent sunt
multi quique lavantes ³²). Ruperti thinks
‘thermae ' is again put for ‘tliermopolia‚'
as in S. viii. 168. But here Juvenal is
speaking of better company. Places of
public resort, where people gathered for
conversation, to meet friends and so forth,
as we do where bands play, were called
‘ stationes? ‘Statio ' is not so used earlier
than the empire. There were three princi-
pal theatres at Rome in and after the time
of Augustus (see Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 60, n.:
“ arcto stipata theatro ³⁵). There may
have been minor theatres besides.

6. Szgffi'eiunt galeae] He means that
while he might be doing his country ser-
vice in the field, he prefers letting himself

to the ‘lanista ’ So he says of Lateranus
who frequented the taverns, he was‘ ζ-Μει

turus bello Armeniae Syriaequej' &a

(viii. 169), and elsewhere (vii. 33) be speaks
of youth as “aetas Et pelagi patiens et
cassidis atque ligonis'' (see x. 134, n.).
The MSS. have ‘ ardens ' (with the excep-
tion of two which have ‘ardenti,' and one
which has ‘ ardentis ³), and all the editors
till Ruperti, who on the conjecture of
Rutgersius, Barthius, and others adopted
‘ardent,’ which isin J alin's [and Ribbeck’s]
text. Heinecke and Heinrich both defend
‘ ardens,' understanding ‘est.’ We say
‘while glowing‚’ and it is no great stretch
of grammar to say ‘dum ardens‚’ though
Ruperti says ‘ et lectio et distinctio’
appear to hini ‘scabra.’ The MSS. vary
between ‘juvenalia’ and ‘juvenilia' The
latter is more in accordance with etymo-
logy.

7. Non eoyem‘e quidem] I think Ruperti
is right in taking ‘ Tribuno ’ for the empe-
ror, as “nullo cogente Nerone '' in viii.
193. As stated in the note there, Augustus
prohibited senators from becoming gladia-
tors, while Nero forced them to act as such.
Here it is implied that though the emperor
did not compe] the man as Nero, he might
have prevented him like Augustus. ‘ Tri-
bunus' is used for the Emperor Caligula,
as it appears, in ii. 165. The tribunician
power was taken by C. Julius Caesar for
life: τὴν ἐξουσίαν τῶν δημάρχων διὰ βίον
ὡς εἰπεῖν προσέθετο (Dion Cass. xlii. 20).
He was content with the power and with
sitting by the tribunes and. taking rank
with them, but Augustus took the title
of tribune ε “id summi fastigii vocabulum
