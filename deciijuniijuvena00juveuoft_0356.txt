D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Rem pateris modicam et mediocri bile ferendam,

Si flectas 0011105 majora ad erimina.
Conductum latronem, incendia sulfure coepta

Confer

Atque dolo, primos quum janua colligit ignes :
Confer et 1105 veteris qui tollunt grandia templi
Pocula adorandae robiginis et populorum
Dona vel antiquo positas a rege coronas

Haec ibi sinon sunt, minor exstat sacrilegus qui

Radat inaurati femur Herculis et faciem ipsam
Neptuni, qui bracteolam de Castore ducat.

An dubitet solitus totum conflare Tonantem ἶ)
Confer et artifices mercatoremque veneni

Et deducendum corio bovis in mare, 011111 quo

145. sulfure coepta Atque dolo,] ‘ Sul-
fure atque dolo' is 0110 subject, ‘sulfure
doloso ’ or ‘ eum dolo positQ’ sulphur
stealthily laid, matches perhaps like our
own.

146. qmtmjanzca colli-qil {gyne-s· :] These
incendiary acts seem to have been not un-
common. Accidental or malicious fires
were so frequent that they are counted
among the vexations of the city from which
the man in Sat. iii. chose to retire (v- 7),
and he who has trusted a secret to a friend
is said to be ready to set 111-0 to his house,
“ candelam apponere valvis '' (ix. 98), a sort
of revenge that would not occur to our
minds now. Grangaeus says Nero's mad
freak of setting fire to the city is referred
to here, and that Nero is the actor iu the
cases of sacrilege that follow, which I sup-
pose Mr. Mayor means too when he refers
to xii. 129, and says “ Offerings were made
to the Pythian Apollo by Midas (Herod. i.
34), Gyges (ib.)‚ Croesus (id. i. 50, sq),
&c.'’ Nero plundered the temple at Delphi,
and it is possible Juvenal had him in mind,
but Ι doubt it. The first syllable in ‘ ro-
bigo ' (as the best MSS. here and elsewhere
I believe have it, not ‘ rubigo ³) is long.
The enamples produced from good poets to
show that it is common are not correct
(see Forcellini).

150. minor exstat sacrileyus qni Radat]
‘ There starts up a petty thief to serape the
thigh of a gilt Hercules? This is the sub-
junctive of the purpose (see Key's L. G.

1179 .

ἓ 152.)bracteolam de Castore ducah] ‘And
strip off a thin leaf of gold from Castor's
statue? There was a collegium of ‘ brae-
tearii,' gold-beaters and gilders, at one time,

155

as appears fron] an inscription in Gruter’s
collection, quoted by Forcellini.

153. Αη dubitet solitus] I can make no
sense out of this line as it stands. He says
compare with your man those who carry off
great venerable cups from teinpleS. If these
are not to be found, then comes a thief in a
lower way, to scrape the gilding from the
statues. lVould he hesitate, seeing it is his
wout to melt down an entire Jove? There
is no sense in this that Ι can see. So H.
Valesius thought, and proposed to change
‘solitus' to ‘ stolidus,' which would not
mend matters, nor would ‘ solus,’ the read·
ing of two MSS. He speaks of the men
who steal cups, then of him who sex-apes
statues, and theu says of course he would
serape them because he was in the habit of
nielting down statues. Gifford puts it down
as “ another striking specimen of J ixvenal's
negligence or want of taste,'' faults few are
less guilty of than this author. ‘ Solitus'
must be wrong, I think.

154. mercatoremque veneni] ‘ Mercato-
rem’ 15 equivalent to ‘emptorem’ here.
See note. on S. xii. 47 : “callidus emptor
Olyutlii.” The Scholiast says it is doubt-
ful whether the seller or buyer is meant.
But the niakers (artifices) are coupled with
the buyers. The crime alluded to in the
next line is ‘ parricidium ⁵ (S. viii. 213, n.). -
Though ‘ parricidium ² included the murder
of relations to 501110 distance in point of
consanguinity‚ this punishment only ap-
plied to the muz-derers of father or mother,
grandfather or graudmother (see Long's
article Cornelia Lex de Sicariis et Vene-
ficis, Dict. Ant) ‘ Fatis ' is the ablative
of quality.
