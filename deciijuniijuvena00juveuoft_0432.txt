Nugari solitos Graece, nec ponere lucum

Artifices, nec rus saturum laudare, ubi corbes
Et focus ct porci et fumosa Palilia foeno3

Unde Remus, sulcoque terens dentalia, Quinti,
Cum trepida ante boves dictatorem induit uxor,

Et tua aratra domum lictor tulit—Euge, pocta 1

Est nunc Brisei quem venosus liber Acci,
Sunt quos Pacuviusque et verrucosa moretur
Antiopa, aerumnis cor chetffieabileficlc‘a.

Hos pueris monitus patres infundere lippos

Cum videas, quaerisne unde haec sartago loquendi

73. Unde Remzzs, sulcoque terens] See
Juv. x. 73, n.: ‘⁴ Turba Remi ?’' Theman
tells how Remus and his brother came from
the country, and how Cincinnatus (L.
Quintius) was driving the plough when his
wife came out in a bustle with his toga, and
a lictor carried home his plough. “ Bravo‚
poet !'' eries Persius, as if this was a grand
effort. Livy (iii. 26) says that when the
men came to Cincinnatus to tell him he was
appointed dictator “togam propere e tu-
gurio proferre uxorem Raciliam jubet.'’
‘ Dentale ’ is here put for the plough, but it
is properly that part of the wood—work into
which the share is let (γύης), the share-
beam. See Servius and other commentators
on Virg. Georg. i. 172 ε “ Binae aures du-
plici aptantur dentalia dorso.'' ⁴ Sulcoque
terens ² is an abrupt way of passing to the
second person. It is as if he had said, ‘et
tu sulco terens?

74. dictatorem induit uzon] A large
number of MSS. have ‘dictaturam,' and
Orelli, Plum, and TVeber have that read-
ing, which also appears in the quotation of
John of Salisbury (Nugae, δια, vi. 2), who
with the sanie MSS. reads ‘ Quem ³ for
‘ Quum.' Jahn says the best MSS. have
‘dictatorein,’ though they are not the most
numerous. This reading is defended by
Heinrich, who compares with it “pueros
producit avaros ’³ (Juv. xiv. 228); “causi-
dicos docuit '’ (xv. 111). He means, Ι
suppose, that by ‘dictatorem induit' we
are to understand she put his robe upon
him and made him dictator. ‘ Induit ' is
used absolutely. He might have said
‘ vestem induit? Most editions have
“ Quum—dictatorem.”

76. Est nunc Brisei] Briseus was a
name of Dionysus, the derivation of which
is uncertain. The Scholiast gives several.
It is here applied to Accius the tragic poet

80

mentioned several times by Horace. The
judgment of the ancient-s upon Accius and
Pacuvius will be found in my notes ou
Hor. S. 1. 10. 53, Epp. ii. 1. 56, and A. P.
258. ‘ Venosus’ is ‘ inflated,' as ‘ verruco-
sus ’ is ‘rougli,’ like a skin full of warte.
Quintilian says Accius and Pacuvius were
both “clarissimi gravitate sententiarum,
verborum pondere.'' (Inst. x. 1.) Tacitus,
or the author of the Dialogue de Oratori-
bus (0. 20), speaks of “Accii et Pacuvii
veternus,'' their heavy drowsy style. ⁴ Bri-
sei ³ may mean the same. ‘ Venosus ' may
be understood from a passage in the same
dialogue (c. 21), quoted by Plum, ‘⁴ Oratio
autem, sicut corpus hominis, ea demum
pulcra est, in qua non eminent venae nec
ossa numerantur, sed temperatus 30 bonus
sangnis implet membra et exsurgit toris
ipsosque nervos rubore tegit et decore
commendat.'' The tragedy of Antiopa
was translated almost literally, from the
Greek of Euripides, as Cicero intimatos
(de Finn. 1. 2). The plot is unknown. It
seems to have been much acted. (See Cic.
Acad. Pr. ii. 7.) Persius says there are now-
a-days persons who are charmed with the
puss'y writings of Accius and the rough
language of Pacuvius, of which he gives a
specimen or a parody. For ‘Brisei’ Ca-
saubon proposed ‘ Briseis' as if it were
the subject of Accius' book. The MSS.
do not vary, and the Scholiast is very
explicit.

80. unde haec sartago loquendi] ‘ Sarta-
go ' is a kettle or frying-pan (Juv. x. 64).
The meaning here is only to be got from the
context, and it seems to be much the same
as ‘farrago,’ a variety of things mixed up
and fried together. The suggestion of Ca-
saubon that it is taken from the hissing of
the pan is noticed but rejected by Porcel-
lini. ‘ Trossuli ’ Pliny says (H. N. xxxiii. 2)
