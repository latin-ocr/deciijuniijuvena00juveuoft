SATlRA vl. 107

especially among women z and these two were so minghxl, that the very shrines which
cherished the one were the slmnieless scenes of the other. Extruvagmnce without
generosity, and driven on by inud lust, bred covetousness, und covetousncss murder, so
that poisoniugs were frequent und notorious. The conditions of domestic slavcry gave
terrible scope for the capric-es mul violence which sels-indulgence generates3 and the
sufferings of the poor wretches froin the ill-temper of their mistress-es is described in
language which has the uir of extruvagnince, but may neverthelcss be accepted as true,
not only from the testimony ofother writers, but from the nature of the case, the known
character of the women, the legal and socia! position of the slave, and moreovcr the
experience (perhaps iu more exceptional cases) of modern times. The love of peisonul
display, of fincry, of gossip, of public amuscmeuts, and the affectution of learning, and
the pride of birth. and the sels—complacency of virtue, are strongly put, but not more so
than the present generation might readily bear. Gluttony and drunkenness are not
oommonly reckoned among women’s sailings, but they appear to have been prevalent in
the time of Domitian. Τ he folly which is perhaps most inexplicable, and without
parallel in our own days, was that of women of family engaging in the arena, and
practising as gladiator-s, hunters, charioteers, and so forth, iu the Circus and Amphi-
theatre. 'rhat such was the niadness of the time there is no doubt ς and it forms one
of the many monstrous features of this satire, iu which there are no traces of those
crimes which are usually associated with the nobler passions in women, jealousy,
disappointed love, ambition ; but all is grovelling, filthy, depraved, and despicably
mean.

The length of the poem and the closeness of the style render the following argument
eorrespondingly long, and the nature of the language and scenes unavoidably introduced
in the satire, but not fit to be reproduced‚ have made the argument defective. But it
gives a pretty faithful idea of the contents of the poem and its divisions. The force of
the original can only be known by reading it.

The date of the satire has been fixed by some in Trajan’s reign, or about Aa). 106.
The arguments are derived from the allusions to the Armenian king in v. 407, and to
the way of dressing the hair described in v. 501. There is an allusion in v. 387 to the
Capitoline gamoe, said to have been instituted by Domitian, from which it is inferred
that the poem could not have been written before his reign, which the nature of it
would sufficieutly show. The notes on the above passages may be consulted.

ARGUMENT.

1 ean believe that when Saturnus reigned Modesty may have lived awhilc on earth,
when cavos were homes for men aud cattle too, when skins and leaves were beds,
and wives were rude as their rude husbands, with sturdy infants at the breast.
They lived not then as now when the world was new, the sous of clay, or of the
forest-trees.

V. 14. Some ,traces may have stayed even when Jove was king, but ’twas before he
wore a bem-<15 before the Greeks had learnt to swear and lie, when thieves were
no man’s dread. Insensibly Astraea left the world, and Modesty, her sister, went
with her.

V. 21. Adultery is an old affair, my friend ς the silver age begot it: every other vice
the age succeeding bore. And yet at this late day you think of marrying, nay
perhaps the barber’s work is donc, and the ring given ! Sui-ely you once were sane;
what marry, Postumus ? what niadness does possess you? While there's a rope
lest will you bear a mistress, while thcre's a window or a bridge hard by ?

V. 38. But you’ve a funcy for the Julian law, and you must have au heir and lose your
presente. What may not huppen if Ursidius wcdS, the most notorious profligate
