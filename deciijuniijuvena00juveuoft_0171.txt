Pertulit lonium constanti pectore, quamvis

Mutandum toties esset mare.

Si ratio est et honesta, timent pavidoque gelantur

J usta pericli

Pectore nee tremulis possunt insistere plantis:

Fortem animum praestant rebus quas turpiter audent.

Si jubeat conjux, ‹hirum est conscendere navem ;

Tunc sentina gravis, tunc summus vertitur aer:

Quae moechum sequitur stomacho valet. Illa maritum 100
Convomit: haec inter nautas et prandet et errat

Per puppem ct duros gaudet tractare rudentes.

Qua tamen exarsit forma, qua capta juventa

Hippia quid vidit propter quod ludia diei

Sustinuit? nam Sergiolus jam radere guttur

105

Coeperat et secto requiem sperare lacerto:
Praeterea multa in facie deformia, sicut
Attritus galea mediisque in naribus ingens
Gibbus et acre malum semper stillantis ocelli.

of the sea ς her reputation she had (lespised
long before, and that is counted no great
loss among these melting ladies. The
women’s litters are put for themselves. See
note on i. 66 as to the ‘ cathedra' and other
kinds of litters. As to ‘jactura‚' see S. iii.
125. n. : ‘ nusquam minor est jactura
clientis?

93. Pertulit Ionium] Bentley, discussing
Horace, Epod. x. 19, “Ionius udo cum re-
mugiens sinus‚'' says the Romans would not
use Ionius, but Ionium, absolutely for the
Ionian sea, because they understood ‘mare ;’
and 118 says this passage must be altered by
putting ‘ sonorum ’ for ‘ sonantem,’ or nn-
derstanding another ‘fluetus’ or else the
use of the masculine is peculiar to this pas-
sage. Bentley might have known that the
Romans, if they wanted a substantive, could
understand ‘ pontus ’ as well as ‘mare.’ Au
the MSS. have ‘ sonantem?

94. Justa pericli] “If there is some good
and honaet cause for them to run into dan-
ger, they tremble and shiver, and cannot
stand for shaking.'’

99. Tam: sentina gravat] “ She has
stomach enough for the sea if she is going
on her own bad errand, but if her husband
wants her to go with him she complains of
the smell from the hold and dizziness, and
vomita all over him.’' ‘ Summus vertitur
ader ’ means the sky is turning upside

own.

103. qua capta juventa] A good many

MSS. have ‘est' after ‘juventa ' which
Ruperti edits. P. wants it.

105. radere guttur Coeperat] This is
only a way of saying he was no longer
a boy, but had a rough heard to shave.
The next line means that he had been
wounded, and was hoping for his discharge
in consequence. He would then become a
¹ rudia1·ius,' concerning which see Hor. Epp.
i. 1. 2, n. He calls him Sergiolus, as Hip-
pia might, in the way of endearment, her
dear little Sergius.

108. Attritus galea] This means a sear
in his forehead made by the rubbing of the
helmet. Forcellini‚ and all the commen-
tators but Heinrich, take ‘ attritus ’ for a
participle. 1 agree with Heinrich,who takes
it as a substantive. Substantives derived
from verbs not uncommonly take after them
a noun in the case that would followthe verb
they arc derived from. Heinrich has given
instances, as “Justitia est obtemperatio
scriptis legibuS.’' (Cic. de Legg. i. 42.)
“ Quid tibi hanc digiti tactio ?” (Plautus,
Poen. v. 5. 29.) A similar construction is
‘signator falso.’ (S. i. 67.) Valesius thought
it necessary to change ‘ galea ' into ‘ galeae,'
supposing otherwise ‘attritus’ must be a
participle agreeing with ‘gibbus‚' which
would be nonsense. Ruperti approves of
Valesius' alteration, but does not adopt it.
[In v. 107 Ribbeck has ‘ cirrns' in place of
‘ sicut‚' which is not easy to explain and is
perhaps a corrupt reading]
