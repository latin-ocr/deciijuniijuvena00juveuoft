SATIRA XII. 277

SATIRA XII.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms isa letter to a friend who is named Corvinus, explaining to him the reason of the
poet’s rejoicing on aparticular occasion, which proves to be the safe arrival of his friend
Catullus, aster a stormy voyage in which he had encountcred the usual dangers and dis-
played the usual amount of sear. There is some playfulness, though perhaps a little
ponderous, 111 1119 description of his friend’s conduct and sufferiugs3 but the whole com-
position cannot have eost the writer much labour, and does not offer much entertainment.
The last thirty or sorty lines are occupied with a stroke at legacy-hunterS, whom Horace
handles so severely (particularly 111 S. ii. 5). This professes to be introduced lest Corvinus
should suppose all this enthusinsm for Catullus’ safety was pretended with an eye to his
will. The short 111151191- to this is that the man has three children, and that no one
would think it worth his while to spend the worth of an old hen dying of pip upon a
man so situated, if his only object was to be remembered in his will. This is the only
part of the poem that belongs properly to satire, and it is only a side-blow.

ARGUMENT.

A day more pleasant this to me, Corvinus, than that which gave me birth. I’ve vowed a
lamb to J uno and Minerva ; a fresh young steer to Jove z were but my means as large
as my affections a bun I'd offer, fat as Hispulla, fed by Clitumnus' stream, giving his
neck to the great popa’s stroke; for he Ι 1ον9 has come, still trembling at the dangers
he's escaped, the ocean and the lightning's stroke. The skies were dark, the lightning
flashed, the sails caught fire, all like a poet’s storm. And then another horror, such as
the pictures show hung up in Isis’ temple (the painter's maintenance, as all 111911 know).
When now the hold was full and all the pilot’s skill was of no 1159, 111911 like the
beaver they began to make a bargain with the winds by tossing cargo overboard.
“ Throw over all I have,”cried my Catullus, and gave to their fate his fiuest clothes, and
then his silver dishes‚ hug-e bowls, baskets, a thousand dishes‚ cups of silver wrought
from which the Macedonian had drunk. tho else in these degenerate days would
venture to prefer his life to his silver ? Nearly all things for use are thus disposed of,
stillto 110 purpose. At last the mast is cut away, and the ship rights: a sad resource
is that which maims the vessel.

V. 57. Now g0, commit your life to the winds, trusting a rough-hewn log, three or
four inchae from destruction at the best. And then remember what you have to carry
when you go to sea, baskets of bread and a fat flagon and hatchets for the storm. But
when the sea fell calm and the wind fair, and fates propitious, the ship went on its
course with clothes spread out and but one foresail lest. The sun brought hope, the
Alban peak is seen and Ostia’s basin entered, a nobler work than nature’s ε 111911 the
sailor lands and loves to tell the story of his dangerous voyage. Go, boys, with reverent
lips and beans, hang garlands on the shrines, sprinkle the knife with meal, set out the
altars. Ι shall come presently, and when that duty's done I shall go home to my
bright Lares: to these 1’11 offer and to Jove ι 1119 boughs are on the door, and morning
lampa are hanging over it.

V. 93. Suspect me not, Catullus has three children. Who would expend the worth of a
dying 11911 011 friend so useless Ρ 110, not a quail. 1f rich Gallita catch a fever or
