SATIRA XI.

Idem habitus eunctis, tonsi rectique capilli

Atque hodie tantum propter convivia pexi.

Pastoris duri est hic filius, ille bubulci ε
Suspirat long-0 non visam tempore matrem
Et casulam et notos tristis desiderat haedos,
Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris,

Nec pugillares defert in balnea raucus
Testiculos, nec vellendas jam praebuit alas,
Crassa nec opposito pavidus tegit inguina gutto.
Hie tibi vina dabit diffusa in montibus illis

A quibus ipse venit, quorum sub vertice lusit :

Namque una atque eadem est vini patria atque ministri.
Forsitan exspectes ut Gaditana canoro

Incipiat prurire choro plausuque probatae

Ad terram tremulo descendant clune puellae :

stood. And what would it signify whe-
ther he asked ‘magno’ or ‘parvo ?’ An
Juvenal says is, when you ask for any
thing ask in Latin, or he will not under-
stand you. Hermann rejects “ non a—
magno ’' [and Ribbeck also]⁸

155. Quales esse decet] There is a play
upon ‘ ingenuus? His was an honest face
and a frank modesty, such as boys who are
born of free parents (ingenui) should have.
Only they wore the ‘ toga praetexta ’
(which he calls the bright purple) in child-
hood. He goes on to say none of his slaves
have learnt the filthy practices required of

some for their masters’ lusts. As to ‘ gutto ’

” see iii. 363. [Jahn and Ribbeck have ‘ pu-

pillares.']

159. Hie tibi vina dabit] The wine from
the hills above Tibur was Horaee’s ‘vile
Sabinum‚’ which therefore had not increased
in value. As to ‘ diffusa ’ see v. 30, n. Hein-
rich considers v. 161 spurious [and Ribbeck] .
There is no harm in it. Heinrich com-
monly rejects lines in this position. They
cannot be said to be necessary or always to
help the sense much, and so they usually
read rather feeble. But that may be said
of most of those sentences which the gram-
marians call by the name of Epiphonema ;
and for this reason many lines, the genuine
production of good authors, lines highly
thought of and frequently quoted, might,

slaves are of domestic growth, plain and
simple but good.

162. ut Gaditana canoro] The practice
of having young dancers and singers and
musicians of both sexes at dinner is suffi-
ciently well known to those who are familiar
with Horace. Livy (xxxix. 6) rcckons it
among the signs of Roman degeneracy since
its connexion with Asia. The women of
Gades are repeatedly mentioned by the
writers of the empire as employed in this
way. In Martial there is an invitation to
a friend very like this of Juvenal's‚ in
which he promises he shall have none of
this wantonness:

‘⁴ Nec de Gadibus improbis puellae
Vibrabunt sine fine prurientes
Lascivos docili tremore lumbos.'’

(v. 78.)

The inhabitants of Gades (Cadiz) were
wealthy and large-ly engaged iu naval and
commercial pursuits. But they found
time to make themselves a character for
immorality. [Jahn and Ribbeck have
‘ incipiant.']

164. Ad terram tremulo descendant]
Ruperti says this means they strike the
earth with their foot. This is almost in-
credible. One would suppose he had never

seen a woman dance or eurtsey in his life.
Horace (C. iii. 6. 21) says :
