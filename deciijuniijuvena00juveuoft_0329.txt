SATIRA XII.

Sed procul extensum petulans quatit hostia sunem 5
Tarpeio servata J ovi frontemque coruscat 3

Quippe ferox vitulus, templis maturus et arae
Spargeudusque mero, quem jam pudet ubera matris
Ducere, qui vexat nascenti robora cornu.

Si res ampla domi similisque affectibus esset,

Pinguior Hispulla traheretur taurus et ipsa

5. Sed procul extensum] A young steer
is tied and chafes at the length of the rope,
and shakcs his head with ruge, waiting to
be offered to Jupiter Opt. Max. The Ca-
pitoline hill was also called Tarpeian (Livy
i. 55) from the treacherous Tarpeia who be-
trayed the citadel on that hill to the Sa-
bines. The precipitous part of the hill
from which criminals were tlirown was
more especially known by that, name.
‘ Sed ' means only that another victim was
reserved for Jove more fitting than the
lamb. ‘ Coruscare' is the same as ‘ vi-
brare? Ruperti says so, and then gives a
choice of other meaning5‚ as usual. Wine
was commonly poured on the head of the
victim before it was killed, and on the
parts that were sacrificed while they were
burning on the altar (see last note). They
were also sprinkled with meal (mola salsa)
and ‘thus’ Juvenal’s description of his
victim is like that of Horace (C. iv. 2. 54,

sarr) =

“ Te decem tauri totidemque vaccae,
Me tener solvet vitulus, relicta
Matre qui largis juvenescit herbis

In mea vota,
Fronte curvatos imitatus ignes
Tertium lunae referentis ortum,
Qua notam duxit niveus videri,
Caetera fulvus.’'

8. ubera matris Ducere,] The meanings
of the word ‘ ducere ’ are very various. It
is here used as it commonly is with ‘po-
cula,’ to drain (vi. 428). Above (v. 3) it is
used for offex-ing a victim, and so it is be-
low (v. 112) and ἰι x. 65: “ duc in Capi-
tolia magnum Cretatumque bovem.’' It is
the ordinary word for marrying a wife (i.
223 vi. 28. 201), for moulding a statue
(vii. 237), for burying the dead (i. 146 ; x.
240), for drawing lots (vi. 583), for drag-
ging by the heels (v. 125 3 x. 66), for spin-
ning (xii. 65), for contracting (as we say of
a stain, &c.) (ii. 81 3 xiii. 215), and so
Horace has it above. Juvenal also uses it
for stealing (xiii. 152). The many other de-

rived meanings of the word may be found in
Foreellini. In many of its significations
‘ trahere ’ is used synonymously with it
(v. 11). ‘ Quippe ferox vitulus,' ⁸ sure 'tis
a wild steer.'

11. Pinyuior Hispulla] Hc says if his
means were equal to his affection he would
offer a bull futter than Hispulla, which
name we have had before (vi. 74). Hein-
rich says it is connected with Hispo (ii. 50)
and a contractiori of Hisponilla, as Marulla
from Maronilla, Maro. The bcast should
be hardly able to carry its own weight (a
prize ox), not reared in the pastures about
Rome, but a white beast whose breeding
glapguis) ShOfflrlth-how that he clinetfmm the

umnus. ιε was a sma s ream in
Umbria still called Clitunno. Rising near
Trebia (Trevi) its course was very short
till it joined the Tinia, a tributary of the
Tiber. It flowed through a valley rich in
pasture land, and celebrated for a breed
of peculiarly white sheep and cattle, to
which Virgil refers (Georg. ii. 146) ε

“Hinc albi, Clitumne, greges, et maxima
ViijtilriilifjA saepe tuo perfusi flumine sacro
Romanos ad templa deum duxere tri-

umphos.”

And Propertius alludes to the same (iii. 10.
25, Paley) ε ’

“Qua formosa suo Clitumnus flumina luco
Integit et niveos abluit unda boves.’'

Τὴθ stream was held in religious veneration,
and there were many small temples near the
source (Pliny, Epp. viii. 8). For this rea·
son and from their colour, the animals bred
on the banks were commonly used for sacri·
fiee. In Horace's time the hills of Algidus
and Alba furnished most beasts for this
purpose. See C. iii. 23. 9 ε

“ Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices,
Aut erescit Albanis in herbis,
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget.'' '
