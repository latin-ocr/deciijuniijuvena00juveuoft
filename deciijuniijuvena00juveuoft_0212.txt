breast'? Τ118 great soul must not be ‹listressed to find itself a blanket—it should
only look at horses, chariots, gods, and furies. If Vir-gil had not had a servant and a
tolerablc house, the snakes had dropped from his fury's head, her trumpet had been
dumb. We expect forsooth that our poor playwright should risc to the old cothurnus,
who to produce his play must pawn his (1151105 and his cloak. Poor Numitor has
nothing for his friend, but plenty for his mistress and his lion—of course the brute
eats less than a poet. Lucanus may lie in his fine gardens content with his great
fame, but what is fame to such as poor Serranus and Saleius, suppose they get it ?
Statius delights the town who crowd to hear him3 but after nll he starves if Paris
does not buy his play. Paris gives honours to the poet—a player does what the great
should do! Yet will you pay your court to these noble people? Praefects and
tribunes come of plays 3 but you'd not envy him who gets his living by the stage.
WVhere will you find me 3 Maecenas now, 3 Proculeius, Fabius, Cotta, Lentulus?
Then genius was rewarded, many then found it worth while to pale their cheek with
study and keep from wine through all December’s feast.

V. 98-104. But is the historian's labour more productive P It wants more time and
011 ; for without limits page on page arises and ruins him 13 paper ς 50 varied are the
topics‚ such the condition of the work. But what is the crop he reapsi’ Not more
than one would get to read the news.

V. 105—149. But they're an idle herd. Well, come ς what do the lawyers get for all
their roaring, especially when their client is in court and nudges them in the side Ρ
Τ1183 truly do they puff their lies like bessows, spluttering all their breast. If you
would know the harvest that they reap, put in one scale a hundred lawyers' patri-
monies and that of one driver in the Circus. The court have taken their seats3 pale
Ajax rises to plead for a man's liberty with a clown for judex. Burst then your liver
that you may hang your staircase with the palm. What is your pay? a flitch of
bacon, or a pot of fish, or old roots, black slaves’ rations, or of bad wine five jars for
four pleadingS. Or if you get an ‘aureus,' the attorney gets a part according to
agreement. Aemilius is rich and has a statue and triumphal chariot, and so he gets
as much as he likes to ask, and yet we 033 conduct a 0358 better than he 0311. ’Τ15
11115 11131 brought Pedo to bankruptcy and Matho too: this was Tongillus' ruin, he
who his great horn carried to the baths, disturbed the bathers with his dirty train‚
‘md through the forum lounged, to buy all manner of fine things, his lying purple
securing him eredit. And yet these fine clothes 318 of use ς they give a man his value ;
it’s their policy to make a noise and wear the look of wealth, for Rome is‘prodigal
and knows no bounds to expense. Trust we our eloquenee Ρ Why Cicero would get
nothing now unless he wore a great ring on 1115 finger. No man employs you till
he hears how many slaves you keep. So Paulus hired a ring and got more fees
than Basilus or Cossus. Eloquence in rags is rare. What chance has Basilus of
being heard? Go off to Gaul or Africa and practise if you have set a value on your
tongue.

V. 150—214. What, teaeh you rhetoric? Ο nerves of 51881, when your whole class is
slaying savage tyrants! They sit and read, and then get up and say it word for
word from first to 1ast; the same dish served again, killing the wretched teacher.
All would learn rhetoric, but none will pay. “Your fee? what have I learnt ?” ·
“Of course the teacher is in fault because the boy 15 a blockhead, whose Hannibal
1135 stunned me week by week, whether it be that he deliberates of going to Rome
from Cannae, or of turning round his troops drenehed with the storm. Ask what
you will 1²11 give it, if you ean make his father listen as osten as I’ve listened to 1115
nonsense.'’ That is the way plenty of teachers talk, and then they quit the hackneyed
themes aud go and practise real strife in the courts. But if my 00113581 weigh with
them, they'll take their own discharge aud go some other course who seek the forum
