4 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nota magis nulli domus est sua quam mihi lucus
hIartis, et Aeoliis vicinum rupibus antrum

Vulcani.

Quid agant venti, quas torqueat umbras

Aeacus, unde alius furtivae devehat aurum 10
Pessiculae, quantas jaculetur Monychus ornos,

Frontonis platani convulsaque marmora clamant

Semper et assiduo ruptae lectore columnae.

Exspectes eadem a summo minimoque pocta.

Martia] has this epigram on one Picens, a
bad poet :

“ Scribit in aversa Picens epigrammata
charta,
Et dolet averso quod facit illa deo.''—
(viii. 62.)

Such writings were called ‘Opisthographi.’
‘ Liber' properly belongs only to books of
papyrus (‘chartae'); but it was not confined
to those (see Dict.Ant. ‘ Liber’). It wasusual
to have a wide margin3 and the larger the
book the wider the margin. Priscian (vi. 3.
16, p. 684) quotes this passage to show that
‘margo’ is sometimes of the feminine gen-
der. The Scholiast makes the same remark,
and quotes Ov. Met. i. 13 for the mascu-
line. [It is difficult to give a satisfactory
meaning to ‘ summi libri‚' unless it can
mean a very large ‘ liber.']

7. lucus fisemis] These are such subjects
as Horace speaks of, A. P. 16.sq. : “ 1110115 et
ara Dianae, Et properantis aquae per amoe-
nos ambitus agros‚'' 810. The Scholiast re-
fers to a grove of Mars on the Appian VVay,
to anotherin which lliabrought forth Romu-
lus and Remus, and that in Colchis where the
golden flecce was kept. Any grove of Mars
will do, and there were many. Of the group
of islands north of Sicily called Aeoliae, Vul-
caniae, or Liparaeae Insulae, the most sou-
therly is that now called Volcano, by the
Romans Hiera 01· Vulcani Insula, and by the
Greeks Ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου. Virgil describes
itin language which leaves little doubt that
this is the place Juvenal refers 10 (Aen. viii.
416—422). Ruperti thinks Aetna must be
meant, because the cave is said to be ‘ near'
the Aeolian rocks, whereas Hiera is one of
them ς which is not worth considering. This
island was in early times a very active vol-
cano (See Smith’s Diet. Geog.‚‘Aeoliae Ins.’).
Heinrich says that in ‘lucus Martis‚' and
1110 cave of Vulcan, and ‘Quid agant venti‚’
Juvenal had his eye upon Valerius Flaccus,
whose Argonautica were written about this
time. See lib. i. 573, sqq.; V. 252, sq.

9. Quid ayant venti‚] ‘ What the. winds
are about.’ The winds follow naturally the

mention of the Aeoliae Insulae, one of which
is said to have been the abode of the gover-
nor of the winds. Strabo says it was Stron-
gyle (Stromboli), ἐνταῦθα δὲ τὸν Αἴολον
οἰκῆσαί φασι (vi. p. 276). 800 Pliny, H. N.
iii. 95 Heyn. Exc. i. on Aen. i.

10. unde alius] Jason from Colchis.
Horace uses the form ‘ pellicula' (S. ii. 5. 38);
11011 Persius (v. 116). It has no diminutive
force, and is only used for convenience.

11.jaeuletur „Monychus ornos,] In Ovid
(Met. xii. 510, sqq.) Nestor relates how
Monychus and the other centaurs tore up
the trees from Othrys and Pelion, and hurled
them upon Caeneus at the marriage of his
friend Peirithous.

12. Frontonis platani] The gardens and
corridors of private persons were lent, it
appears, for this purpose. Fronto is a
name which occurs often under the empire-
The most distinguished was M. Cornelius
Fronto the orator, who was one of the
tutors of M. Aurelius Antoninus The man
in the text may be any body. The exagge-
ration of the speaker's powers, and the ap-
plause of his friends, are amusing, and the
verses very forcible. In the peristylia of
large houses trees of considerable 51ῑο were
grown. “ Inter varias nutritur silva colum-
nas ²³ (Hor.Epp. i. 10. 22). The plane tree
was much cultivated by the Romans. Com-
pare Hor. C. ii. 15. 4: “ platanusque
caelebs Evincet ulmos.” ‘Convulsa' and
‘ruptae' Graugaeussays are medical words,
as if the pillars were in a state of convulsion
and bursting blood-vessels: “Rupti convulsi-
que dicuntur qui nervorum affectione et
spasmo laborant; sed et eadem ratione sic
apellantur qui nimio clamore venis tumes-
centes offenderunt.” As to the construction
‘ruptae lectore,' see Hor. i. 6. 2, n. Servius
quotes this verse on Virgil: “Et cantu
querulae rumpent arbusta cicadae’' (Georg.
iii. 328).

14. Empectes eadem] “Yon may look for
the same stuff from all sorts of poets, from
the greatest to the least: I then (ergo) must
write, for I too have been to school and been
whipped 111111 declaimed3 and since paper
