A. PERSII FLACCI

Haec sancte ut poscas Tiberino in gurgite mergis 15
Mane caput bis terque et noctem flumine purgas.

Heus age, responde 3 minimum est quod scire laboro :

De Jove quid sentis? estne ut praeponere cures

Hunc cuiquam? “ Cuinam vis ?” Staio.

An scilicet haeres?

Quis potior judex puerisve quis aptior orbis i> 20
Hoc igitur quo tu Jovis aurem impellere tentas

Dic agedum Staio :
Jupiter !’

‘proh Jupiter ! 0 bone (clamet)
At sese non clamet J upiter ipse?

Ignovisse putas, quia cum tonat ocius ilex

Sulfure discutitur sacro quam tuque domusque ¹? 25
An quia non fibris ovium Ergennaque jubente

Triste jaces lucis evitandumque bidental,

Idcirco stolidam praebet tibi vellere barbam

Jupiter? at quidnam est, qua tu mercede Deorum

and 118 1135 ‘ ducitur.' Nerius is a fictitious
name used by Horace (S. ii. 3. 69, “ Scribe
decem Nerio '’).

15. Tiberino in gurgite] See Juv. vi.
523, 11. ‘ Bis terque' is equivalent to
‘again and again.5 See note on Hor.
Epod. v. 33, “ Longo die bis terque muta-
tae dapis Inemori spectaculo.'’ ‘Noctem'
means the pollution of the night's de-
bauchery ‘Haec' is ‘such prayers as
these!

17. minzmzcm est quod seire labem :]
Horace has“ scire laboro'’ (Epp. i. 3. 2),
and“ pulcre fuerit tibi nosse laboro'' (S.
ii. 8. 1p9). He ask 5, and says 531 castically
it is a very small matter that he wants to
know, what the man thinks of Jove that
he prays to him thus. Would 118 rank him
above any inan? Whereupon the other
suggests that he should name some one:
he names Staius, and when the man seems
to hesitate 118 asks, who can be better
than Staius either as a ‘judex' or
‘tuton' But let him go and ask of him
what he asks of Jove, and Staius would
cry out with indignation. Shall not then
Jove much more cry out? The reader
may make what he ean of this. The
general sense is plain, that men are ready
to ask of heaven what they would not ask
of any man. But from the way the ques-
tion is put we should expect to have a bad
man brought forward, and the Scholiast
says Staius (whom he calls Aelius) was a
corrupt ‘judex' If so v. 20, “quis potior
judex, puerisve quis aptior orbis ?'’ must be
taken ironically, and in that case the wit

destroys the sense. The reading in the
text ‘ cuiquam’ is that of many MSS. and
Heinrich. Most editors repeat ‘cuinam :’

“ Estne ut praeponere cures
Hunc—‘ cuinam. 9⁹ —Cuinam. 9 vis Staio. 9„

This (1085 not get rid of the difficulty,
though it may be the true reading. This
sort of question and answer is in Persius'
style, but it adds nothing to the strength
of it.

26. fibris ovium Eryennaque jubente]
That is through the directions of Ergenna,
and the sacrifices he bids you offer. Er-
genna is in form an Etruscan name like
Porsenna, as Casaubon observes, and these
religious rites being all of Etruscan origin,
an ‘ haruspex ' of that nation is supposed.
As to ‘fibris' see S. i. 47, n. ‘Bidental’
{mitat-¹1¹5& ἒὲ ἒίἕιῗῖἇξὲἔέ 1ῗο ἕῗῖἒὲἷῖ
it was purified.0 See Horace, A.yP. 471,
“ an triste bidental Moverit incestus?
where as here the name of the spot is given
to the coi-pse struck dead in it. ‘ Vellere
barbam ’ we had in the last Satire (133).
‘ Quidnam est qua tu mercede,’ Heinrich
says, is the same as ‘quidnam mercedis
est qua tu.' That does not explain the
construction. He begins, ‘What is it ?’
and he adds ‘With what price ?’ vIt is
like ‘ quid‚' ‘quid enim‚' at the beginning
of a sentence. ‘Lactes’ are the small
intestines. See Plautus, Curculio ii. 3.
40, “Ita cibi vacivitate venio laxis lacti-
bus.'’ The Greeks called them ’γαλακτί-
δες. See Forcellini.
