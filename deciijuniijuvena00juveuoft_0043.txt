must examine cai-efully. 1 think that many of Bibba-kt« criticis-ms
on particular passages may be answered, but it seems to ine impossible
to read the work of the so-eallod Declamator without feeling the great
dissei-enee between him and the writer of the ten undisputed Satires.
Whether that difference is best explained hy assuming that we have
two writers under oue name, or ou some other hypothesis, is a matter
which every reader must determine for himself.

The peculiar difficulty of Persius consists in the arrangement of the
dialogue or supposed dialogue. There are also a few passages which
perhaps no editor has yet satisfactorily explained. I think Mr. Macleane
has handled the matter well, though he may be mistakeu sometimes.
Ι agree with what he says of Jahu's eopious commentary. ‚Jahn‘s
edition is a most laborious and useful work, and his commentary is full
of learning. But the good sense is not equal to the learning, and he is
sometimes completely wrong in his explanation. I prefer Heinrich’s
briefer and less learned noteS.
