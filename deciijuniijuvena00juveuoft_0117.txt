pears in a great variety of shapes in the
MSS., one of them being ‘Arthuri.’ Nonc
of them are known nameS. He says that if
some rich man's great house is burnt to the
ground (cecidit) the town goes into 111011111-
ing as if for some great public misfortuue ;
mati-ons go with their hair loose, and men
of the highest rank put on black z the
praetor declares a ‘justitium ' or suspen-
sion of business, and puts off the ‘vadi-
monin,' which was the word for the engage-
ment entered into by a defendant to appear
on a given day. (See Hor. S. i. 9. 36, n.)

214. Time gemimus casus Urbis‚] Many
MSS. have ‘ geminus? which Heinrich has
admitted, Ι suspect by mistake. One MS„
M„ has ‘geminus Urbis casus.5 No others
have this reading, but three of the earliest
editions have it.

215. Ardet adhuc] ‘Ardet,’ as Heinrich
observes, is used impersonally. ‘Accurrit
qui donet ’ is ‘ one runs up to give.’ His
friends are in such a hurry that before the
fire is out they run up to offer him money
and marblc, and all sorts of things to fur-
nish a new house. There were two sculp-
tors named Polycletus, of whom the more
famous is conjectured to have been a native
of Sicyon, and afterwards a citizen ofArgos.
He lived during the Peloponnesian war,
{md Euphranor at Athens about a century
uter.

218. Haec Asianorum] The MSS. vary
here, and Heinrich pronounces the verse
corrupt. The Scholiast had the reading of
the text, and two of the best MSS.. inclu-
ding P. Most of the MSS. have ‘ Phaeca-
simorum: which Turnebus (Adv. 1. x. c. 7
and 27) explains by ‘ Phecasia,’ and this,
Hesychius says, means ‘ a rustic shoe.’
Britannicus also quotes Appian (Bell. Civ.
v. 11), who speaking of M. Antonius
spending the winter with Cleopatra sayS,
καὶ ὑπόδημα ἣν αὐτῷ λευκὸν Ἀττικὸν, ὃ
καὶ Ἀθηναίων ἔχουσιν ἱερεῖς καὶ Ἀλεξ-

ανδρέων, καὶ καλοῦσι φαικάσιον. Forcellini
gives this explanation. With no authority
Jahn has ‘hic' for ‘haec' 'rhat ‘haec’
is found in every MS. seems certain,
whether as part of Phaecasianorum, or
alone. VVhether it should be taken for
the neuter plural or feminine singular is
doubted. Ruperti thinks it is feminine,
and that the women join in with their
offerings. If the text is right, and ‘ haec'
be plural, it is supplemental to the line be-
fore, the statues of Euphranor and Poly-
cletus being taken from temples in Asia.
But ‘ hic ’ seems to be wanted.

219. forulos mediamque Minervam,]
‘ Book-cases and a bust of Minerva.' Sue·
tonius says Augustus “condidit (libros
Sibyllinos) duobus forulis auratis sub Pa-
latini Apollinis basi.'' A ‘modius’ was
equal very nearly to two gallons.

220. ‘meliora et plura reponit Persicus]
He replaces 1115 105505 with much better
things than the fire lias destroyed. The
name is changed from Asturicus to Persi-
cus: whether the same person is meant is
immaterial. We must not take him for a
Persian as Gifford does. As to ‘orbi‚' see
above, v. 149. This gives us the reason
for all the attention the man is paid. Mar-

{inlt has described a case like that in the

(iii. 52.)
