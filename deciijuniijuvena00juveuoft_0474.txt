Sambucam citius caloni aptaveris alto.

A. PERSII FLACCI

95

Stat contra ratio, et secretam gannit in aurem
Ne liceat facere id quod quis vitiabit agendo.
Publica- lex hominum naturaque continet hoc fas,
Ut teneat vetitos inscitia debilis actus.

Diluis helleborum certo compescere puncto

100

Nescius examen, vetat hoe natura medendi.
Navem si poscat sibi peronatus arator

95. Scmzbucam citius caloni] ‘ You shall

sooner teach a gawky calo to play upon the
harp.’ ‘ Calones ' were camp slaves, of whom
each soldier had one to carry his lieavy ac-
coutrements (136, 11.). They were chosen
therefore for their strength, and were the
least likely to be fit for learning the harp.
⁶ Sambuca ⁵ was au eastern instrument, aad
the name is supposed to be Hebrew. A repre—
sentation of it is given in Dict. Ant—&vos
πρὸς λύραν, ὄνος πρὸς αὐλόν, were Greek
proverbs which Persius illustrates in his
way.

96. secretam gannit in aurem] ‘Whis-
pers privately in his ear.’ The MSS. and
editions vary between ‘gannit’ and ‘garrit.’
casaubon and Jahn have ‘ garrit.' Most
of the editors have ⁶ gannit.’ Lubinus re-
fers to Juv. S. vi. 643 and there is no
doubt ‘gannit' expresses a low whisper
better than ‘garrit.' ‘ Secretam gannit in
aurem ' is like “seductis committere Di-
vis,'’ in S. ii. 4, and “ arcanam mendicat in
aurem '³ (Juv. vi. 543).

98. Publica lex hominum naturaque]
He says philosophy and the law of nature
enforce this principle, that ignorance
should abstain from attempting what is
forbidden to its weakness. [‘Quod natu-
ralis ratio iuter omnes homines constituit,
id aput omnes populos peraeque custoditur
vocaturque ius gentium, quasi quo iure
omnes gentes utuntur ' (Gaius i. ξ 1). The
terms Jus Gentium, and Jus Naturale are
equivalent, and the Jus Naturale is
founded on the ‘ naturalis ratio,’ the com-
mon under-standing of mankind. In this
passage of Persius we have both ‘ publica
lex ' and ‘ naturass where ‘ natura ’ appears
to be only explanatory, and to mean the
‘naturalis rati0‚' which is the foundation
of the ‘publica lex! ‘ Publica lex,' so far
as Ι know, is not a term used by the
Roman jurists3 but it seems to express the
Jus Naturale of the Roman jurists Jahn
explains ‘ natura ³ thus: ‘ quae unicuique
rei insita est: but this is a mistake]
Horace sayS, “Audax omnia perpeti Gens

humana ruit per vetitum nefas'' (C. i. 3. 25,
sq.), where ‘ vetitum ' is used as it is here,
for that which the weakness of man is for-
bidden, by the unwritten law of nature, to
attempt. ‘ Ratio’ is the Stoics' reason,
their philosophy. Horace so uses it, S. i.
3. 78, “ cur non Ponderibus modulisque
suis ratio utitur,” as Heinrich says, and hc
may be right in so taking v. 115 of that
satire, “ nec vincet ratio hoc‚'' though I
have not done so in my note on that verse.

100. Diluz's helleborum] Suppose you
take to mixing medicine though you do not
know how to regulate the scale. Here the
‘ statera? or steelyard, is referred to (see
note on S. i. 7). Ordinarily ‘ examen ²
means the tongue or needle of the Libra, a
balance, asin Virg. Aen. xii. 725, “ Jupiter
ipse duas aequato examine lances Sustinet.”
Here it means the equipoise (aequipon-
dium),which moves along the bean] (scopus)
and determines the weight of the thing in
the scale, by the notch (punctum) in
which it rests (‘ compescitur ³ as Persius has
it), when the bean] is even. Persius says
the man does not know how to stop the
weight at a given notch or point. See Dict.
Ant„ Trutina, Libra. In the latter article
the Libra is represented without a tongue.
But such must have been of a ruder sort.
Without the tongue a pair of scales could
have been of small nse.

This passage seems to be imitated from
Horace, Epp. ii. 1. 114, sqq. ι

“ Navem agere ignarus navis timet ,- abro-

tonum aegro

Non audet nisi qui didicit dare: quod
medicorum est

Promittunt medici ,-
fabri ς

Scribimus indocti doctique poemata pas-
sim.”

tractant fabrilia

102. peronatus aralor] As to ‘perona-
tus ' see J uv. xiv. 186, n. ‘ Luciferi rudis ’
is one so ignorant of the skies, that he did
not know tshe morning star when he saw it.
Melicerta, or ,Melicertes was a sea god,
