of it. But, as in Horace, the three sisters
are sometimes represented as spinning, and
here Clotho’s functions 310 usui-ped by La-
chesis. Elsewhere Clotho represents all
three (see Dict. Myth. ‘ Moerae ³).

29. Cedamus patria .·] Juvenal may in
this scene have had in mind the way in

which Charinus in Plautus' Mercator
(Act V. Sc. 1) takes leave of Athens:

“ Hunc hodie postremum extollo mea domo

patria pedem.

Ego mihi alios deos Penates persequar,
alium Larem,

Aliam urbem, aliam civitatem 3 ab Atticis
abhorreo.

Nam ubi mores deteriores increbescunt
indies,

Ubi qui amici infideles sint nequeas per-
noscere,

Ubique id eripiatur animo tuo quod pla-
ceat maxume,

Ibi quidem si regnum detur non cupita
est civitaS.''

vivant Artorius istie] These are names,
according to the Scholiast, of men of low
birth, who got their living by cheating, and
made themselves rich by such means, But
this is only gathered from the context.

30. qui niyrum in eandida ‘reduald
‘ tho will swear black is white,' which was
a proverbial way of speaking with the
Romans as with us, Ovid describes Auto-
lycus as

“ —— furtum ingeniosus ad omne,
Qui facere assuerat, patriae non degener
artis,
Candida de nigris et de candentibus atraf'
Met. xi. 313, sqq.

31. Qui-s· facile est aedem condueere‚]
As to ‘conducere,' see i. 107, n. Horace,
describing the town, says (Epp. i. 1. 76) :

“ —— nam quid sequar? aut quem ?
Pars hominum gestit conducere publica :
sunt qui
Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaraS‚'’
&a :

where ‘ conducere publica' is probably to
take conti-acts for public works, though it
may 1110311 the farlning of the taxes like-
wise. Government contracts have in 311
times been profitable affairs. Ruperti need

not have been anxious to change ‘aedem '
into ‘aedes,’ though he had the authority
of oue Ms. of inferior quality. ‘Aedes ’ in
the singular is a sacred building, as 111 the
plural it stands for a private dwelling, as is
well known. Juvenal speaks therefore of
men contracting for the repair of temples
and shrines, as well as for cleariug the beds
of rivers, cleansing and keeping the sewerS,
the repairing of harbonrs, and likewise for
funerals, and for the sale of slaves by
auction. Public works, which under the
republic were looked after by the aediles,
had special officers (curatores) to superin-
tend them during the empirc, and the
functions and dignity of the aediles were
much curtailed. Suetonius (Aug. c. 37)
tells us that Augustus “ quo plures partem
administrandae reipublicae caperent nova
officia excogitavit: curam operum publi-
corum, viarum, aquarum, alvei Tiberis.'’
These officers engaged contractors (re-
demptores) to carry out the necessary
works.

The clear-ing of the Tiber was particularly
necessary from the quantity of alluvial soil
brought down by the stream and the rapi-
dity with which weeds formed in the bed.
Gellius (xi. 17) gives part of an old prae-
tor's edict, beginning “QUI FLUMINA
RETANDA 10111103 REDEMTA HABEN'rss’
&c., where ‘retal-e’ probably signifies to
drag (as we say), though Gellius gives
a different explanation. ’

The Cloaca Maxima, said to have been
constructed by Tarquinius Priscus, was
large enough for a boat or a wag-gon of
hay to pass down it. Lipsius infers from
a passage of Pliny (H. N. xxxvi. 15) that
there were seven principal sewers which
emptied themselves into the Cloaea Maxi-
ma, and there were drains from all private
houses into these, so that the underground
works of Rome were on nearly as large a
scale in proportion as those of London.
The eost of keeping these drains in repair
was very large ; though the solid construc-
tion of the Cloaea Maxima with stone
arches, of which remains still exist, left
little to be done for that. Livy (xxxix.
44) says that in the year A.U.c. 568 the
censor-s contraeted for the cleansing. of
the sewers and for construeting others
where they were wanted3 and Dionysius
