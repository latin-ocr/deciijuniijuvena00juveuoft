from Seneca and Pliny. ‘Machaera' is
the name of an auctioneer or crier, not a
parasite or a barber as Ruperti, who gene-
rally gives us a wide choice, suggests.
Heinrich says the name should be Magiri,
which has been corrupted through Machiri
to Machaerae ‚- this however is in Heinrich’s
text.

10. commissa quod auctio] Grangaeus
has a bad note here which Ruperti says is
not bad: “ubi licitantes utrinque pretio
pugnant: translate a gladiatoribus, qui
proprie committi dicuntur.” ΜΓ. Mayor
adopts this note. ‘ Commissa auctio’ is a
sale ‘bonorum commissorum: forfeited
goods. ‘Commissum’ was a thing con-
fiscated. (See Forcellini.) ‘Oenophorum’
is a wine-jar (vi. 426). ‘Tripodes’ are
old-fashioned tables (“ Sit mihi mensa tri-
pes,'' Hor. S. i. 3. 13). The {inest tables
of the Romans (orbes) rested on a single
pillar (Hor. S. ii. 2. 4, n.). ‘Armaria'
were cupboards or cases, usually for books,
standing against the walls, ‘as opposed to
‘ capsae' and ‘ scrinia,' which were boxes
also used for books. (See Hor. S. i. 4.
21, n.) Ruperti confounds ‘ arinaria' and
‘ scrinia.' ‘ Cista’ was any box, large or
small. It was sometimes big enough to
hold a man, though he had to squeeze to
get into it. See last satire, v. 44, and
Horace, S. ii. 7. 59 ε

“- an turpi clausus in arca,
Quo te demisit peccati conscia herilis,
Contractum genibus tangas caput,’'

where ‘ arca’ is the same as ‘ cista!

12. Alcithoen Pacci,] This is the read-
ing οἲ Ρ., except that by an obvious error it
has Alcitheon. Alcithoe was the Boeotian
woman, daughter of Minyas oforchomenus,
who refused to celebrate the rites of Dio-
nysus, and was changed into a bat by him
together with her sister Leuconoe (Ovid,
Met. iv. 390, sqq.). There was a. festival
connected with Bacchus observed at Orcho-
menus as late as the time of Plutarch
(Quaestiones Graecae, 38) called Agr-ionia,
which was said to have had its origin from
these sisters. lu consequence of their con-

nexion with Bacchus some MSS. have
Bacchi for Pacci. There are many various
readings here, which Ruperti has given
with the authoritieS. These were, no
doubt, tragedies by living writers, whether
Paccius and Faustus were their real names
or not. Thebes under a hundred forms
gave subjects for the stage; and there are
fragments of a play founded upon thc story
of Tereus and the two sisters Procne and
Philomela by Sophocles. See Aristoph.
Aves, 100. The Scholiast on v. 280 of that
play says Sophocles was the first to handle
this subject, and after him Philocles. The
subject was popular at Rome (see below, v.
92).

14. saciant equites Asiani,] Knights
from Asia, Cappadocia, Bithynia, and Ga-
latia (altera Gallia) are slaves who have
made equestrian fortuues (see iii. 154, n.).
Ruperti thinks Achaintre is right in calling
them ‘ chevaliers d’in(lustrie.' They have
this interpretation to themselves, Heinrich
considers v. 15 spurious ; Jahn includes it
in brackets. Bithynus has the first sylla-
ble long in x. 162 ; xv. 1 (Bithynice) ς and
in Horace, Epp. i. 6. 33. It has therefore
been proposed to make Bithyni and. Asiani
change places. The verses appear as they
stand in all the MSS. [Ribbeck omits
v. 15, and gives good reasons for condemn-
ing it. If Juvenal wrote it, we must
blame him for inserting such a verse. But
the omission of this verse does not remove
all the difficulty, for we must then take
‘Altera quos,’ δια, as explanatory of
‘equites Asiani ;’ and ‘Asiani' properly
means ‘ those of the Roman province Asia!
It may be answered that Juvenal uses
‘ Asiani' generally for people of Asia 3 but
if so, the term is then too extensive, and
in Sat. iii. 218 he certainly means only
the temples of the province Asia.] As to
CappadoceS‚ see Pers. vi. 77. Galatia, or
Gallograecia, got its name from the Galli,
who in the year B.c. 278 came over from
Byzantium to help Nicomedes I. to get
the kingdom of Bithynia. He gave them
the neighbouring country, which was called
after them. (See Mr. Long’s article ‘ Ga·
