Graecam urbem : quamvis quota portio faecis Achaei ⁴?
Jam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes

Et linguam et mores et cum tibicine chordas
Obliquas, nec non gentilia tympana secum

fieri dives, Bithynice? conscius esto.’' The
name of Verres has never eeased to be
proverbial since the exposure of his crimes
by Cicero. See S. ii. 26, and viii. 106.

54. opaci Omnis arena Tayi] Martial
expresses both (the shade and the gold) in
his Epigram to Licinianus (i. 50. 15):

“Aestus serenos aureo franges Tago
Obscurus umbris arborum.'’

The Pactolus, Po, Ganges, and Hebrus
were all reputed to have gold in their sands.
See below, xiv. 299, and Pliny H. N.
xxxiii. 4.

56. ponendaque praemia] Rewards you
must one day part with, lay down, like
‘deponere.' See F orcellini for examples.
“ Reddenda, ut quae male ante quaesita
sunt.'’ (Scholiast.)

58. Quae nunc divitibus qens] He goes
on to tell how the town is overrun with
Greeks and Eastern strangerS, and though
118 is asbamed to think of it, that shall not
make him hold his peace. ‘ Properabo fa-
teri ' implies that the confession is disgracc-
ful, and that he forces himself to it 83 8
111811 who makes haste to do a disagreeable
duty and get it over. He repeats his com-
plaint about the Greeks in S. xv. 10.

61. quamvis quota portio] He corrects
himself and says, ‘ and yet how small 8
portion of our dregs are from Greece ?'
‘ Quota ’ with ‘ pars ' (or here ‘ portio ¹) ge-
nerally signifies ‘ how small 8 part‚’ as Lu-
cretius (vi. 652): “ Et quota pars homo
sit terrai totius unus-” (See Forcellini.)
‘ Quotus ' is the question which is answered
by 811 ordinal numeral, and ‘ quota pars’
means properly, in a series of graduated
parts what place would the thing occupy Ρ
and the implication is that it would come

pars,’ 83 ‘ septima pars,¹ ‘ octava,' δὶα,
would be the seventh, eighth, &c., part.
(See Key's L. G. ξ 248, and note.)

62. in Tiberim dqsluaeit Orontes] The
Orontes (Nahr—cl·Asy)‚ which flows from
the south in Coele-Syria to the north,
where it enters the sea four miles below the
ancient Seleucia, is here put generally for
the province of Syria, which was added to
the Roman dominions by Cn. Pompeius
ΛΑΜ). 689. Its own trade, and that of the
East, to which it opened a wider door,
brought to Rome that influx of slaves of
which Juvenal complains. The Orientals
have little 01· no ear for music3 and on
lower ground than Umbricius takes, he
might have run away from the music of
Eastcrn finge-olem, harps, and drums. They
were probably such as are still in use all
over Asia, and no discord is comparable to
that which is there listened to with satis-
faction. The first instrument has usually
but two or three holes, and no steps, and
the last (corresponding to the Indian tom-
tom) is beaten with no perceptible reference
to time. The sort of harp herc mentioned
was called ‘sambuca,' and it was triangular,
which is ineant by ‘obliquas’ The girls
are those who were called ‘Ambubaiae’
(See note on Hor. S. ii. 1. 1, “Ambubaia-
rum collegia.'') Diuaciuin in Plautus
(Stich. ii. 3. 356), says Epignomus has
returned from the East, and brought with
him “ fidicinam, tibicinas, sambucfflas, exi-
mia forma.” The Circus Maximus had
vaults under it, which were occupied by
prostitntes. ‘J ussas’ means that they were
hired for the purpose by others, who made
gain of their prostitution. Propertius (ii.
23. 21) says: “

“Et quas EuphrateS, et quas mihi misit
Orontes
Me capiant: nolim furta pudica tori.''
