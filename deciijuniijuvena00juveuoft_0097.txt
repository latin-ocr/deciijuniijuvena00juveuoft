SATIRA ΙΙΙ.

Arbor, et ejectis mendicat silva Camenis.
In vallem Aeg-oriae descendimus ct speluncas

Dissimiles veris.

Quanto praestantius essct

Numen aquae, viridi si marg-inc clauderet undas

Herba nec ingenuum violarent marmora tophum.

Hic tunc Umbricius, Quando artibus, inquit, honestis
Nullus in Urbe locus, nulla emolumenta laborum,
Res hodie minor cst here quam fuit, atque eadem cras
Deteret exiguis aliquid, proponimus illuc

Ire fatigatas ubi Daedalus exuit alas,

Dum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus,
Dum superest Lachesi quod torqueat, et pedibus me

16. ejectis mendicat silva Camenis] The
Camenae to whom the wood was dedicated,
and who are here said to have been ejccted
to make way for beggam, were not the
Muses, though by the Latin poets the two
names are confounded, from Camenae being
connected with Carmen in the sense of a
prophecy. They were four prophetie di-
vinities peculiar to Italy. Their names
were Antevorta, Postvorta, Carmenta, and
Aegei-ia.

17. In vallem Aeger-iae] This is supposed
to be the valley now called La Caffarella, in
which there is a fountain and grotto by some
identified with Aegeria’s here described. It
is one of the sources of the small river Almo,
now called Acquataccia, perhaps a corrup-
tion of Aequa d’Appia, as the Via Appia
crossed it about a mile and a half from the
Porta Capena (see Smith's Dict.Geog.Almo).
Juvenal speaks of artificia] ἔποπος, but does
not probably mean more than one. He says
it was not like a natural cave, and that the
divinity of the stream, or the spring where
the divinity was supposed to live, would
look much better if the fountain had a grass
margin there than with marble spoiling the
native stone. There was probably a statue
in that grotto representing the god, as there
is still in that mentioned above.

et speluncas] Servius (on virgil, Georg.
ii. 469, “speluncae vivique lacus ”) says:
“id est bona naturalia, non sicut in urbibus
labore quaesita, unde J uvenalis Et speluncas
dissimiles verisf’

18. Quanto praestantius esset] The MSS.
have all ‘ praestantius esset? with the ex-
ception of Ρ., which is imperfect, and has
‘ praes*ntius.' Grangaeus first, and after
him Heinsius, conjectured ‘ praesentius,’
which Heinrich and Jahn have adopted.
Virgil has “ praesentia numina Fauni ’'

(Georg. i. 10) ; “nec tam praesentes alibi
cognoscere Divos'' (Ec. i. 42), on neither of
which places does Servius, who is fond of
quoting Juvenal, quote this place. 1 think
Juvenal wrote ‘ praestantius: for the copy-
ists were not likely to coin that word out of
‘ pracsentius,’ especially m'th a knowledge
of Virgil’s lines.

20. inyenuum violarent marmora lo-
phum] ‘Tophus’ is a stone which Pliny
(H. N. xvii. 4) describes as ‘scaber‚ natura
friabilis,’ ‘rotten-stoness Ovid describes
Diana’s fountain in the valley of Gargaphie
thus (Met. iii. 157) (Juvenal would have
adinired it, and perhaps thought of this
description) ε

“-- in extremo est antrum nemorale
recessu,
Arte laboratum nulla: simulaverat artem
Ingenio Natura suo ε nam pumice vivo
Etlevibustophis nativum duxerat areum.’¹

‘ Ingenuum ’ means ‘ plain, unsophisticated,’
and ‘ violare ' ‘ to spoil.’

23. here quam fuit‚] As to ‘here' the
ablative and ‘heri’ the dative form, see
note on Hor. S. ii. 8. 2.

25. ubi Daedalus exuit alas,] Τὴε legend
of Daedalus flying from Crete and alighting
first at Cumae, where he dedicated his
wings to Phoebus, is told by Virgil (Aen.
vi. 14, s . .

27. quilm? superest Lachesi] This is like
Horace (C. ii. 3. 15) :

“ Dum res et aetas et sororum
Fila trium patiuntur atra.”

In the Greek conception of the Μοῖραι, who
according to Hesiod were three, Clotho,
Lachesis, and Atropos, it was Clotho’s busi-
ness to spin the thread of human life. La-
