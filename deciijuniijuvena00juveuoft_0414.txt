D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Improbus aut campum mihi si vicinus ademit,
Et sacrum effodit medio de limite saxum
Quod mea cum patulo coluit puls annua libo ς

Vana supervacui dicens chirographa ligni 3
Exspectandus erit qui lites inchoet annus

Totius populi.

Sed tune quoque mille serenda

Taedia, mille morae 3 toties subsellia tantum

Sternuntur 3 tum, facundo ponente lacernas

Caedicio et Fusco jam micturiente, parati
Digredimur lentaque fori pugnamus arena.

Ast illis quos arma tegunt et balteus ambit

Quod placitum est ipsis praestatur tempus agendi,

Nee res atteritur longo sufflamine litis.

Henninius' and other old editions is ‘ pa·
tulo,' in support of which Heinrich quotes
Virgil (Aen. vii. 115), “patulis nec parcere
quadris,'' broad flat cakes. Ruperti fol-
lows the majority of MSS. in reading ‘ve-
tulo‚' which he says is “lectio haud dubie
exquis'1t101·,”and that the ‘libum ³ is called
‘vetulum’ because the ceremony, or the
possession of the property and the stone are
old, either of which goes to increase the
offenee. This is hardly worth repeating.
Any person whose boundary was removed
had an ‘ actio termini moti’ against the
person who did it.

40. perye't ozon reddere nummos,] “ Per-
sists in not restoring money deposited with
him.'' This is the ofl'enee that gave occasion
for S. xiii. (see note 011 xiii. 16). The next
line is repeated from the 137th of that
satire, which Heinrich considers a manifest
proof of imitation. But supposing the line
has not got into the text surreptitiously,
this is not a very good proof of imitation.
Men do not borrow whole lines from an
author they are imitating. Juvenal repeats
himself in x. 365 and xiv. 315.

42. qui lites inchoet annus] “I must
wait for some indefinite time that shall
even make a beginning of the causes of an
entire people.” So Heinrich takes it, and
I see no better way. ‘Annus totius po-
puli’ Ι 01111 make no meaning of. Mr.
Mayor calls it “ thepeople'syear ; in which
the litigation of a whole people is to be
settled.'' If the text is not corrupt, this
is the most unlike Juvenal's style of any
part of the satire. ‘Annus’ is probably a

definite word for an indefinite period. ‘ In·
choare ² is commonly used for such a begin-
ning as is not brought to an end3 and
‘tunc quoque,' &c., means that no more
than a beginning is made or likely to be
made.

44. toties subsellia tantum] This means
that the court was ready, eushions on the
seats, and every body there, but the advo-
cates loitered. The case must therefore
wait. As to ‘lacerna ³ see i. 27, n. [‘jam
facundo,’ Pgs, Jahn and Ribbeck]

46. parati Diyredimur] This is the
language of the amphitheatre. “ Prepared
to tight wc are obliged to separate, and the
forum 15 but 11 slow arena for our combat.’'
‘ Balteus ' was a belt which went over the
shoulder and held the sword. ‘ Sufflamine '
is explained on viii. 148 to be a drag, and
it is here used in that sense figuratively.

51. testandi militibus jus] Under the
Roman law all that a son acquired who was
not free from 1115 father's power by emanci-
pation or death was acquired for his father,
and he had no power of making a will.
About the time of Augustus an exception
was made in favour of money aequired
through military service, which was called
‘ castrense peculium? Whatever a son got
while he was ‘ in patria. potestate ³ was ‘ pe-
culiu1n‚’ and with certain modifications was
held on the same terms as a slave’s (iii. 187,
n.).› In the time of Constantine the same
privilege that attached to the ‘ castrense pe-
culium,'or money earned in military service,
was extended to money carned in civil officos‚
which was therefore called ‘quasi castrense
