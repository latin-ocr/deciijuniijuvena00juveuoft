45. Frigidus excutitur cinis,] The old
ashes were removed, he means, to make
way for fresh sacrifices. Caesonia (Cali-
gula’s wife, whom he had married two
years before, having had her for his mis-
tress) contracts for arms to hang up at
the temple doors, hires shawls for the
kings to wear whom he is to bring home
captive, and shaggy auburn beards for
his pseudo German prisonem, and war
chariots‚ and stout Gauls from the banks
of the Rhine. Suetonius (c. 47) says
that besides his German prisoners and-
deserters he chose out the tallest Gauls
he could get, those who would best adorn
his triumph, and some Gaulish chiefs too,
and ordered them to dye their hair red,
and let it grow, and to leam the German
language, and bear German names. ‘Gau-
sapmn’ or ‘gausape’ is a rough woollen
eloth. But it is used in iv. 37, an obscene
ffffifia‘ssg'gytffssssss 3332333 i‘gmgfflfiss
the meaning here. As to ‘ locaress which
signifies to let work to be done or some-
thing to be used, see note on Hor. C. ii.
18. 17, “Tu secanda marmora Locas.'’
Forcellini understands Rhenos to mean
‘statues of the Rhine‚' such as were
carried in triumphal processionS. So the
river Jordan is represented on the arch of
Titus, Jahn so understands it too· But
there is no reason to suppose a number of
such statues would be carried in the pro-
cession‚ and the above passage of Suetonius
shows what Caligula’s orders were. The
sorrn Rhenos is Greek, Ῥῆνοι. Rhenanos
is the Latin form.

48. Centum paria] A hundred pairs of
gladiators, whom he intends to send into
the arena (inducere in arenam) in honour
of Caligula’s Genius. A hundred pairs
was the number to which Staberius'
heredes were condemned if they did not
carry out the provisions of his will (Hor.
S. ii. 3. 85). The number exhibited on
great occasions went on increasing during

the Empire till a hundred became a small
show. (See Dict. Ant„ Gladiatores.)

50. Oleum artocreasque popello] He
threatens to add to his cxtmvagance hy a
Iargess of oil and bread :ind meat to the
people. ‘Artocreas’ (ἄρτος, κρέας) is not
found elsewhere. It seems to bc a com-
pound of ‘visceratim' a distribution ot'
meat, and ‘frumentati0‚’ of corn, which
were both common on great occasions.
(See note on Horace last quoted.) ‘ Vm· ’
is a threatening exclamation, ‘ Woe betnle

'ou !'
ὃ 51. Non adeo (inquis) z] ‘Not at all‚'
say you, ‘your land is pretty well ex-
hausted3’ like a body without the bones,
it is worthless. So he supposes the man
to turn up his nose at the inhcritance.
Forcellini's interpretation of ‘exossatus'
as land that has been well looked after
and cleared of stones, is certainly wrong.
[Jahn has a full stop at ‘inquis,' and
he makes ‘Exossatus . . .juxta est ’ part
of the poet's answer. As the reading ‘non
adeo' may not be the genuine text, and
as the sense of ‘exossatus ’ is not certain.
it is impossible to say what this passage
means. Heinrich interprets ‘non adeo’
thus: 1 do not accept the inheritancc,
‘ non adeo heriditatem? He takes ‘juxta ’
as equivalent to ‘ paene.’]

52. Aye, si mihi· nulla] He goes on.
‘ Very well, if you don't want my inherit-
ance‚an‹l if I have not a relation left, I
can go and pick up a heres among tho
bcggars,' who were numerous on the Via
Appia. ‘ Bovillae ' was ou that road, and
about twclve miles from Rome, and so
the poets spcak of it as a suburb. Prop.
v. 1. 33, “Quippe suburbanae parva minus
urbe Bovillae.” Ovid, Fast. iii. 667,
‘⁴ Orta suburbanis quaedam suit Anna
Bovillis.'’ This old woman employed hcr-
self in making cakes for the poor people,
with whom ber neighbourhood ahonnded.
