trees, and dragged out of his eave by the
heels when dead, is told by virgil (Aen. viii.
192-267); by Iaivy (i. 7); by Ovid (Fast.

ο i. 543, sqq.); and Propertius (iv. 9).

127. Hiscere, tanquam habeas] ‘ If you
ever attempt to open your mouth, as if you
were a man of family and had three names?
Roman citizens had generally three names :
¹ praenomen,' which was given on the ninth
day after their birth ς ‘gentilicium nomen,'
which indicated the Gens they belonged to ;
and ‘ cognomen‚' which was the family
name belonging to their branch of the
Gens. To these was sometimes added an
honorary name, called ‘ agnomen,' derived
from some great action, or other cause, aS,
‘Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus? A
, slave had only one name, and a freedman
took usually the ‘ praenomen ' and ‘ nomen
gentilicium ' of his late master, but not his
‘ oognomen,' instead of which he sometimes
rleatained his own name which he had as a
5 ve.

— Quando propinat] The practice of
drinking heulths was as common with the
Romans as with modern nations. ‘ Bene
te? or ‘bene tibi,’ was the formula, as in
Plautus (Stichus v. 4. 27); “ Bene vos!
bene nos! bene te! bene me! bene nos-
trum etiam Stephanium !'' and elsewhere
(Persa v. 1. 21) : ‘⁴ Bene mihi ! bene vobis!
bene meae amicae ! bene omnibus nobis !''
,It was a complimentary way of doing this
to drink and pass the cup on 'to the person
so saluted, with the word ‘bihel' From

this practice ‘ propinare‚' προπίνειν, arc
derived. [Ribbeck has ‘ sumitve.’] As to
‘regi,' see above (i. 136).

131. perlusa dicere laena.] As to
¹ laena,’ see iii. 283, 0. ‘ Pertusa ' is one
with 110105 10 it.

132. Quadringenta] ‘Millia sestertium ’
is uuderstood.⁸ 400,000 sesterces was the
fortune necessary for an ‘ equeS‚' by Otho’s
law (see iii. 155: “ Cujus res legi non suf-
licit ''). From here to 145 is a digression.
The dinner is resumed in 146.

133. donaret hamum-im] Ruperti makes
‘homuncio’ the vocative case. It is the
nominative, and is meant by way of amusing
contrast to ‘ deus‚’ in the line before.
Some good little man, like to the gods
(θεοείκελος), and kinder than the
fates.

135. Da Trebio !] The master bids the
good things be given to his rich guest,
and calls him brother, and asks him if he
would not like a nice slice off the loin of the
boar. The name Trebius is repeated from
v. 19, above.

139. Luserit Aenea-2] These are Dido's
words (Aen. iv. 328): “ Si quis mihi par-
vulus aula Luderct Aeneas qui te tamen ore
10101101.υ He says, a rich man without
children gets 11110 friends, who expect some-
thing in the will.

140. Jucundum et carum]
this is spurious, but does not say why he
thinks so. [Ribbeck omitsit from the text.]
