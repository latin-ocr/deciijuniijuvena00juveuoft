Trypherus is the name he invents for
some master of the art of carving. It
may be derived from τρυφή, as C. Valesius
suggests. ‘Apud quem’ is ‘in whose
house.' The teats of a sow were a great
delicacy. The boar was commonly the
chief dish (caput coenae) of a large dinner,
and served whole. ‘Pygargus' was some
sort of deer named from its white rump.
‘Scythicae volucres’ were pheasants
(Phasianae aves), a delicacy only enjoyed
by the rich. Of the ‘phoenicopterus,'
the flamingo, the brains and the tongue
were considered particular delicacies‚ as
the tongue is still. Martial has an epi-
gram on the phoenicopterus (xiii. 71) :

“Dat mihi penna rubens nomen: sed
lingua gulosis
Nogtgit psstpit: quid si garrula lingua

He means what would the gluttons have
thought if it had been a singing bird,
such as those of which Aesop ate a dishful
(Horace, S. ii. 3. 245, n.z “Luscinias
soliti impenso prandere coemptas ³³). The
flamingo is found in the south of Europe,
but the Romans probably got them most
abundantly from the coast of Africa
(Penny Cyclopaedia, art. ‘Flamingo').
The ‘oryx' was an African wild goat
with one horn, which Juvenal says was a
great delicacy. It is not mentioned as
such elsewhere. ‘Ulmea coena’ is a col-
lection of wooden models used for prac-
tising upon. They made such a clatter
that the whole Suburra echoed with it.
The school therefore was in that part of
the town (S. iii. 5, n.).

142. Nec frustum capreae] He says his
young beginner is not only a novice in
carviug, but in stealing too. ‘ Afra avis '

Quum posces, posce Latine.

is doubtful. See note on Horace, Epod.
ii. 53: “Non Afra avis descendat in ven-
trem meum.’' It is supposed to be the
guinea fowl. ‘ Ofella' is a chop, the
diminutive of ‘ offa? He says his boy is a
novice in every thing, and has only got so
far in thieving as to purloin a small chop.
‘Et’ is ‘and only,’ which is implied in
‘ exiguae?

146. a frigore iutus,] The time is
spring, and he says his servant is an un-
couth boy and clad in warm clothes which
the fine houses do not allow. The eastern
slaves were paraded in their own dress, it
seems, in all weatherS. The vulgar cups
are such as he describes in S. v. 46, and
the slaves which are not his are such as
the great man has in that satire:

“ Flos Asiae ante ipsum pretio majore pa-
Qulggusfuit et Tulli census pugnacis et

Anae> (v. 56.)

His are country-bred slaves and only
know Latin; they were not bought for a.
large sum from a dealer. They are all
dressed ahke, and are not generally very
particular about their hair, which does not
flow over their shoulders in curls, but is
cut close and straight, and is combed
to-day as an exception because of the
company coming. The three lines that
follow are true and touching, the best
sort of poetry.

148. et mayna] This is clearly the true
reading. P. and the three other MSS.
have ‘in magno,' which is in the lemma
of the Scholiast. Those words have no
sense here. They are joined on to the
following clause by Jahn, and Mr. Mayor
says it is ‘ in magno poculo quum posces ς’
but the phrase he quotes from Cleero
