Servorum ventres et frugi coenula magno.
Fictilibus coenare pudet, quod turpe neg-avit
Translatus subito ad Marsos mensamque Sabellam

Contentusque illie veneto duroque cucullo.

Pars magna Italiae est, si verum admittimus, in qua
Nemo togam sumit nisi mortuus. Ipsa dierum

which most poor men lived. Sec Hor.
Epp. i. 1. 91, n. Even for such a inise-
rable lodging the speaker says they had to
pay 11 high rent, and they could not ‹lo
without a certain number of slaves, whose
bellies must be filled, and their frugal
family meal cost a good deal. Horace,
who lived as plainly as any man could do,
and was a bacheler, could not sit down to
his dinner of leeks and fritters without
three slavae, which he considered the height
of independence (S. i.6. 116). Umbricius
was married, and had children, and the
customary number of slaves in every house—
hold had grown enormously since the days
of Horace. The domestic slaves had their
supper from the remains of their master‘s.
Sometimes they dined with the family,
but on ‘subsellia‚’ seats below the mas-
ter’s table, where also the children sat.
But this in later times when the number
was so greatly increased, could only be
confined to a few of the upper slaves
and favourites‚ particularly ‘ vernae‚' those
born in the house. Horace describes the
luxury of those familiar meals very warmly:

‘O noctes coenaeque Deum! quibus ipse
meique
Ante Larem proprium vescor vernasque
procaces
Pasco libatis dapibus.'’
(S. ii. 6. 65, sqq„ note.)

He only tasted his dishes and passed them
on to his slaves. (See Becker’s Gallus, Exc.
slave Family.) Slaves had commonly at
this time an allowance of grain equal to
three pints a day. See Horace, S. i. 5. 68:
“ cui satis una Farris libra foret gracili sic
tamque pusillo;’' and Epp. i. 14. 40:
“Cum servis urbana diaria rodere mavis.'’

168. Fictilibus coenare pudet,] Men are
ashamed to dine off earthenware, though
they are not so when they leave Rome and
suddenly find themselves in the country,
with plain fare before them. This seems to
be the meaning, and ‘ negavit‚' the reading
of all the MSS„ will bear it, if understood
in an aoristic sense. Grangaeus conjectured
‘ negabit‚' and Valesius ‘ negabis,' which
Jahn adopts [and Ribbeck] The Scholiast

gives it some support. ‘⁴ In Urbe in {icti-
libus vasis manducare turpe videbitur;
quodsi apud Marsos aut Sabinos vixeris
negabis esse turpe.'’ Heinrich observes,
that in the Florentino MS. of the l’andect,
one of our oldest MSS„ b and υ are otten
interehanged. Ι think it not unlikely
‘negabit’ is the true reading. The coni-
mentators generally suppose Dentatus to be
referred to. Ι think they are wrong. 'Phe
Marsi were of Sabine origin, and all who
were so were included under the name
Sabelli. (See Note on Hor. S. ii. 1. 34.)

170. veneto duroque cuculla] ‘Venetus '
is ‘ sea-green.’ Sailors wore their jaekets
of this colour. (See Forcellini.) ‘ Cucullus '
was a hood attached to the ‘ lacernae!
Ruperti approves of ‘culullus,' a sort of
cup, (Hor. A. P. 434) as a substitute for
‘cucullus,’ because Umbricius is talking
about ‹lining. He has spoken of the man’s
plain table, and here speaks of 1115 dress.

171. εἰ verum admittimus,] This is a
sort of phrase like ‘ ne nobis blandiar' (V.
126). He says that no one wears the toga
in a large part of Italy till he is dead, when
the body of a free person was always clad
111 a toga such as accorded with his rank.
So Martial speaks of ‘¹ pallens toga mortui
tribulis'' (ix. 58). Pliny urging his friend
Praesens to come back to Rome after a
long absence in the country, asks him how
much longer his toga is to have a holiday:
“ Quousque calcei nusquam Ρ toga feri-
ata ¹? ’³ (Epp. vii. 3.) And Martial writes
to Linus ε

“Egisti vitam semper, Line, municipalem,
Qua nihil omnino vilius esse potest.
Idibus et raris togula est excussa Kalendis,

Duxit et aestates synthesis unzdecggis
iv. .

He only puts on his toga, and that a shabby
one, twice a mouth, on the Ides and Ka-
lends, which were holidays.

172. Ipsa dierum Festorum] If the high
festivals (⁴ majestas festorum ’) were ever
celebrated with the performanee of plays in
a theatre, in which the people sat round on
the grass, and a temporary stage waserectetl,
and some old familiar farce was acted, with
