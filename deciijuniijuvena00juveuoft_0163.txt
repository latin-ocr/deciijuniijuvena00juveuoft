SATIRA Y 1.

1123

Pellibus, haud similis tibi, Cynthia, nec tibi, enjus
Turbavit nitidos exstinctus passer ocellos,
Sed potanda serens infantibus ubera magnis,

Et saepe horridior glandem ructante marito.

Quippe aliter tune orbe novo caeloque recenti
Vivebant homines, qui rupto robore nati
Compositive luto nullos habuere parentes.
Multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan

Aut aliqua exstiterint et sub Jove, sed Jove nondum

The chastity of the women of these times is
referredto again below, v. 287 : ⁴¹ Praesta-
bat castas humilis fortuna Latinas,'' «icc.
7. haud similis tibi, Cynthia,] Cynthia
was the mistress of Propertius, to whom
many of his elegies arc addressed. She died
before him, and during their connexion.
Her real name was Hostia. The next line
refers to Catullus' mistress, whom he calls
Lesbia, but whose real name is said to have
been Clodia. There arc two odes addressed
to Lesbia's sparrow, one of which is a
lament for its death. The last lines are,

“O factum male! Ο miselle passer!

Tua nunc opera meae puellae
Flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli.'' (c. iii.)

Martial has an epigram in which the matter
is mentioned (vii. 14) z

“Accidit infandum nostrae scelus, Aule,
Agssiglliiisus deliciasque suas.

Non quales teneri ploravit amica Catulli ;
Lesbia, nequitiis passeris orba sui.”

9. Sed potanda ferens] ‘⁸ Non sugenda
tantum,’' says Grangaeus. Aulus Gellius
tells how he accompanied the philosopher
Favorinus to the house of a lady who had
lately given birth to a child. The good man,
aster inquin'ng about the health of the
patient, the duration of her labour, and
other particulam, said to her mother that
of course the young wife would suckle her
own child. The mother said no 3 that it
would be too hard upon her poor daughter,
after going through the pains of childbirth,
to be called upon to discharge the disagree·
able duty of a nurse. Whereupon the phi-
losopher gave her a very sensible lecture on
the duty of mothers in this respect, which
might be a useful lesson to some fine ladies
ofthe present day. It will be found in Aul.
Gellius, Noct. Att. xii. 1.

12. qui rupto robore nati] One of tho
sources from which mankind were said to

15

have sprung was the trunks of trees. Hesiod
(Op. et Di. 145) produces the third racc
of mankind from the ash : ἐκ μελιᾶν. The
oak is the mother more commonly given,
as here and in Virgil: “Gensqne virum

truncis et duro robore nata.''

(Aen. viii.
315.)

This fiction Servius says (in loco)
arose out of the circumstance that the first
men made their dwellings in the hollow
trunks of trees, a singular habitation. It
more likely arose from the hardiness attri-
buted to the early inhabitants of the earth.
The mountain ash would naturally be the
type or parent of mountaineexs, the hardiest
of men; and hearts of oak have been pro-
verbial in all times and languageS, whether
in a good or bad sense.

“ Te lapis et montes innataque rupibus altis
Robora, te saevae progenuere ferae ”

is Dido’s reproach to Aeneas (Ov. Her. vii.
37), which explains the origin of the fablc
well enough.

13. Compositive luto] This was the
work of Prometheus ε

“ Quam (terram) satus Iapeto mixtam fluvi-
alibus undis
Finxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta
deorum.'’ (Met. i. 82.)

A strange coincidence with the Mosaic ac·
count. Horace gives a version of the story
not found elsewhere:

“ Fertur Prometheus addere principi
Limo coactus particulam undique
Desectam et insani leonis
Vim stomacho imposuisse nostro.''
(C. i. 16. 13, where see note.)

Compare (xiv. 35): “Et meliore luto
finxit praecordia Titan.'’

15. εἰ sub Jove,] See note on v. 1. He
says, while Jove was a boy Modesty still
lingered on the carth. Vthn his beard
began to grow she departed. See v. 59.
‘⁸ Multa aut aliqua ’' is an anticlimax which
