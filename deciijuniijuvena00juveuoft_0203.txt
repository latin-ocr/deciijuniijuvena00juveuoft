Pectora pullorum rimabitur, exta catelli,

Chaldaeis sed major erit fiducia : quidquid

Dixerit astrologus credent a fonte relatum

of the miracles of the loaves and tishcs, and
from those it is inferi-ed that it· was the
general practice of the Jews when travel-
ling to carry about with them small baskets
with their daily food. See Bengel 011 Matt.
xiv. 9: “Numerus cophinorum respondit
numero apostolorum ut singuli cophino
quein gestabant pleno ,muderentf' The
impostor here introduced is an old palsied
Jewess, whispering in the woman's ear
something from the law of Moses, with
which, especially those that related to the
Sabbath, it appears the superstitious were
easily frightened. See notes on Horace,
S. i. 9. 69: “ hodie tricesima sabbata‚’' and
ii. 3. 291. Solymus is an adjective. The
plural Solyma is used for Jerusalem by
Martial, xi. 94: “Solymis quod natus in
ipsis.'' The priestess of the woods (sacer-
dos arboris) is explained by S. iii. 15, 16 :

“ Omnis enim populo mercedem pendere
jussa est
Arbor et ejectis mendicat silva Camenis.”

She gets a see, but not so large as the priest.
Probably the Jews traded upon the dream
interpretations of Joseph and Daniel, and
made people believe it was a gift of their
tribe. Selling dreams is to sell the inter-
pretation, to make them out whatever may
be desired. ‘Areanam in aurem‚' ‘ into her
private ear‚' is an unusual kind of phrase.
Heinrich thinks it should be ‘ areanum.’

550. Armenius vel Commayenus harus-
pex .·] The next beggars are fortune-tellers
from the Ensis, professing to deal with the
future through the bowels of beasts and
birds, sometimes, he adds of human vic-
tims. Commagene, which was to the north
of Syria, on the right bank of the Eu-
phrates, was at this time a Roman province,
having been made so in the year ΔΑ). 73.
The capital was Samosata, afterwards the
birthplace of Lucian.

551. rimabitur‚] The MSS. vary. P.
has the future, nearly all the MSS. have
‘ rimatur et.' But Juvenal is more likely to
have written the future and without the
conjunction.

552. faciet quod deferat ipsa] He

will kill the child, and then go and inform.

553. Chaldaeis sed major erit] The
astrologers (mathematici) from Babylon and
other parts ot'Asia were a nuisance that
frequently caused the interference of the
state. Cicero speaks of them as numerous
in his time, and Tacitus said they were a set
of knaves who would he always forbidden
and always retained (Hist. i. 22). See In-
troduction to Horace, C. i. 11, where he
advises his Leuconoe to have nothing to do
with them. They appear to have had great
hold on women's minds. Augustus is said
by Suetonius (e. 94) to have had a firm saith
in them, which may be doubted. Tiberius
had a party of them at Capreae.

554. afonle relatum Hammonis,] The
tradition Juvenal seems to follow respecting
the Libyan oracle of Jupiter Ammon is that
related by Servius on virgil iv. 196 ι “ Hic
Hammone satus.'' He says that when Liber
or Hercules (for the story varies, he says)
was passing ‘through the deserts of Libya
with an army, being bound for India, he was
in want of water ; and when he prayed to
his father Jove, a ram was sent to show him
the way to a spring, which the beast dis-
covered by scratching the ground with his
foot. It need not be supposed that Juvenal
had more respect for the oraele of Hammon
than for any other.

Dion (lxiii. 14) says that Nero, either
angry with Apollo for some answer he got
from him, or under the influence of some
other madness, robbed the temple at Delphi
of the land of Cirrha, which was attached to
it, and gave it to his soldiers: at the same
time he put an end to the oracle and killed
the priests. He robbed the temple, in fact,
to support his own extravagance, as Henry
VIII. robbed the churches. The oracle was
not restored till after this satire was probably
written, by Hadrian, from whose time till it
was finally abolished by the Emperor Theo-
dosius, it continued to be consulted.

556. damnat ealiyosuluri] ‘ Damnat’
means ‘ punishes ' them for their sins, or for
the sacrilege of Nero. ‘Damnare‚’ like
‘obligare,’ is ‘ to bind under a penalty?
