cubitus.' Julia afterwards died inan at-
tempt forced upon her by Domitian, to
procure abortion‚ which is alluded to in v.
32, sq. Pliny (Epp. iv. 11. 6), speaking of
Domitian, says he put to death a Vesta} for
incest and was as bad himself: “Quum
ipse fratris filiam incesto non solum pollu-
isset verum etiam occidisset, nam vidua
abortu periit.'' According to Dion Cassius
(67. 3) this happened A.D. 83; the same
year, probably, as the murder of Sabinus.
At the same time Domitian was engaged in
the reforming of public morals(Sueton. Vit.
c. 8. ‘⁶ Suscepta morum correctione,” ὣς)
having taken upon himself the censorship
forlife 3 he being the first of the emperors
who had nominally assumed that office (see
S. iv. 12). The ‘lex ‚Iulia de Adulteriis'
may have been loosely obser-ved, and Sue-
tonius speaks of Domitian having enforced
with severity, and 011 several occasions, the
law against unchaste Vestals, ‘⁶ a patre suo
quoque et fratre neglecta'’ (c. S), see below,
iv. 9, 11. 111 that loose age the ‘ lex
J ulia de Adulteriis ’ above mentioned (see
Dict. Ant.) would be called ‘ amara omni!
bus‚’ and a terror to the adulterous Mars
and Venus. ‘ Abortivls signifies means of
abortion. ‘ Tunc' means that he was re-
storing the laws at the very time when 110
was carrying on his intrigue.

34. vitia ultima] The most vicious of
men, ‘res pro persona ; ’ as ‘ servitium ' for
‘ servu& ‘ remigium' for ‘remigeS,' 810.
‘ Fictos Scauros’ are those villains who pro-
fess to be as virtuous as M. Aemilius Scau-
rus, who is alluded to again (xi. 91) in con-
junction with the Fabii, Cato and Fabricius.
See Horace, C. i. 12. 37, n., ‘⁵ Regulum
et Scauros animaeque magnae Prodigum
Paullum,’⁷ where the plural is used as here.
See 11010 011 S. i. 1093 and above, on vv. 3.
10. Because Sallust (B. J ug. 18) speaks
Of Scaurus as ‘ callide vitia occultanS,' Ru-

..,.

perti supposes Juvenal may mean that these
men were like Scaurus in his (lissimulation.
But whatever Sallust may have thought of
Scaurus, he was classed with the noble and
honest citizens of Rome by others. Juvenal
says that the lowest characters, who made
no eoneealment oftheir vices, despised these
hypocrites, and when they attacked them
returned their bite, as Horace says (Epod.
vi. 3) :

“ Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas
Et me remorsurum petis P '’

36. Lauronia] This is any woman of
the town. The name is said, without any
probability, to be taken from Laui-on, a
town of Hispania Tarraconensis (Beck,
quoted by Ruperti in his Var. Leon).
Some MSS. have Laronia, which occurs in
inscriptions. The woman smiles quietly at
these hypocrites crying out pathetically for
the ‘lex Julia' (see note 011 v. 29), and says
to one of them : ‘ Lucky times are these,
which present such a bari-ier to immorality
as you. Let the town blush at her lewd-
11055; another Cato has dropped from the
skies. But where did you buy your per-
fumery P ³ And then she breaks out in a
fierce invective against men, and a defence
of her own sex. ‘ Subridens ' expresses
bitterness, as in Aen. x. 742: “Ad quem
subridens mista Mezentius ira.'' The taunt
about the ointment is sarcastic enough 3 and
the speech, which passes from quiet irony
to the utmost scorn, is well managed.

40. Tertius e eaelo cecidit Cata] This
seems to 110 an allusion to Domitian’scensor-
ship spoken of above (v. 29. n.). Some eom-
mentators do not see why there should be
three, that is, why Cato of Utica should be
associated with the Censor. But Juvenal
has put them together, and the younger
was an honest man.
