viii PREFACE.

Of the English translations I have referred to, those of Dryden
and Gifford are the ablest. Dryden has not translated all the
Satires. Holyday’s is a quaint piece os rhyming prose, with some
learned notes. He often hits the sense where others miss it. Dr.
Johnson’s imitations of the third and tenth Satires Ι have noticed
in their places. Happening to have the Italian translation by
Teodoro Accio (Lugano, 1828), Ι have sometimes referred to it,-
and have found it, as far as Ι have done so, sensible and often
correct. I believe it has a high reputation in Italy.

Having edited Horace for this series, Ι have referred freely to my
own notes in that edition. Ι hope Ι shall not appear egotistical in
so doing. I must either have taken this course, or repeated almost
word for word what I had written before.

This has been found still more necessary with respect to Persius,
who has imitated Horace so freely as to compromise his character
for originality, though he has merits, as well as defects, that are
his own:

This author has lately been edited (Leipzig, 1843) with much
care by Otto Jahn, whose edition of Juvenal is mentioned above.
His notes on Persius are in the style of Ruperti’s on Juvenal,

ξ though they have more merit. Readers who wish to be referred to

a great variety of authors and critics, will use Jahn's edition for
that purpose ¹. For the author’s meaning Heinrich is a better guide
in my opinion. His notes were edited at the request of his son by
Jahn the year after his own edition, and seven years after the death
of Heinrich. They are shorter and less elaborate even than those⁴
on Juvenal, but whatever Heinrich says is to the purpose and the
fruit of his own intelligence. The freshness of that sort of com-
mentary is very pleasant to those who have waded through a sea
of complicated notes, in which every thing more or less remotely
bearing upon the text is brought in to smother it. When are
authors to be made their editors’ first and only consideration ⁶?

The edition of Casaubon represents the learning of that great

¹ J ahn's Prolegomena on the Life and Scholia and MSS. of *Persius are the best part
of his book. Though long and rather tedious, they are scholarlike and useful.
