lucro Appone” (C. i. 9. 14). [Ribbeck
has ‘ Haec tamen ignorant, quid sidus
triste minetur !’ which verse with those
which follow it here as far as v. 581, he
places aster v. 626.]

572. Illius occursus etiam] ‘Etiam’
must be taken with ‘ occursus,' “ avoid even
meeting her, to say nothing of marrying
her,'’ as Heinrich says. ‘ Pinguia sucina ’
are balls of ambcr which the luxurious
carried in their hands to keep them cool iu
the hot wcather. ‘ Pinguia ’ would express
the sticky clammy state they would come
to in a hot hand. Heinrich takes it so,
Ruperti differently. See S. ix. 50: “ cui
sucina mittas Grandia.'' Ovid refers to
this when he says of the tears of the He-
liades (see S. v. 38) : “lucidus amnis Ex-
{impii}⁷ et gigigpushisnitttitlgestalpdafLaStinis ’³

e . n. . ar ia spea ·s o “ 'ucina
virginea. regelata manu '’ (xi. 8). As to
‘ ephemerides‚' see above, v. 557.

576. numeris revocata Thrasylli] “ Nec
Babylonios Tentaris numeros,” is Horace's
advice to Leuconoe (C. i. 11. 2). It means
the astrologer’s calculations. The Thra-
sylli father and son were astrologers, and
the father a learned physician who lived in
close intimacy with Tiberius. The origin of
their acquaintance, which began when Tibe-
rius was at Rhodes, is told by Tacitus
(Ann. vi. 21). The son is said by Tacitus
to have foretold the accession of Nero to the
empire (Ib. c. 22). The woman will not go
with her husband to the camp or come home
if they are abroad, nor go out for a drive, if
the hour is not propitious according to the
almanac of Thrasyllus, and must consult her
horoscope before she puts salve on her eye
if ititehes. As to ‘collyriass sce note on
Hor. S. i. 5. 30.

581. nisi quam dederit Petosiris] This
was the oldest Egyptian astrologer. He is
commonly mentioned in conjunction with
Necepsos, the other Egyptian authority.
See Pliny, HN. ii. 23: “ Egyptia ratio quain
Petosiris et Necepsos ostendere.” vii. 49:
“ Durat et ea ratio quam Petosiris ac Ne-
cepsos tradiderunt.” Their age is quite
unknown. Almanacs and such like books
probably bore their names. Ruperti's
note, “Petosiris pro quovis astrologo ut
Thrasyllus‚” is nonsense. This woman
does not consult the astrologers, but is
learned in books, which Juvenal says is
worse.

582. Si mediocris erit‚] If she be a
person in humble life, she will go and get
advice from the astrologers in the Circus ;
respecting whom see note on Horace, S. i.
6. 113, sq.: “ F allacem Circum vesperti-
numque pererro Saepe Forum 3 adsisto
divinis‚'' where this passage and v. 588 are
referred to and explained. ‘ Poppysma ’ is
‘ a smack of the lips‚' such as is made by a
hearty kiss. Such seems to be the mean·
ing here. See Forcelliui and Heinrich’s
note.

These verses 582—591 seem rather to
belong to the former class, who consulted
the astrologers. He has done with those,
and passes in v. 569 to others who do not
want advice, but give it, who have only to
consult their books and their horoscopes
and so forth for themselves. It appears
to me that these verses should come after
v. 568. The great Chaldaean comes to the
rich womau’s house, or she hires a Phry-
gian or Indian ; the poor woman must be
content to go to the Circus aud consult the
common cheats.
