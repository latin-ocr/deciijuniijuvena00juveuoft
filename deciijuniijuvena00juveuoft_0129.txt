SATI ΒΑ lv. 7⁴.)

Quid refert igitur quantis jumenta fatiget 5
porticibus, quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

Jugera quot vicina soro, quas emerit aedes?

Nemo malus felix, minime corruptor et idem

Incestus, cum quo nuper vittata jacebat

Sanguine adhuc vivo terram subitura sacerdos. 10
Sed nunc de factis levioribus : et tamen alter

Si fecisset idem caderet sub judice morum.

Nam quod turpe bonis Titio Seioque decebat

Crispinum.

Figura. Quid est Crispinus ? Aeqrae so-
laque libidinesorles Deliciae—sortes, nt
quem nullus potest etiam a consuetis vitiis
deterrere.'’ There is plainly some con-
fusion in this note, which Heinrich has
meuded3 and the reading of the above MS.
(which has been corrected by a later hand)
has no other authority. Yet Jahn has
adopted it [and Ribbeck] and Mr. Mayor
says it is the reading of the best Mss.
⁴ Spernatur' has the same authority, with
the addition of some of the Parisian MSS„
and is adopted by Jahn. It is not a word
found in any other author, and the common
reading is ‘aspernatum' [Ribbeck places
all this introduction‚ vv. 1—36, ‘ Ecce
iterum Crispinus’ to ‘ dixisse puellas ' at
the bottom of his page, as spurious]

5. quantis jumenta fatiget Porticibusj
He asks what does it matter (‘refert ' is
‘ rem fert‚’ see Key's L. G. 910; Hor. S.
i. l. 49, 11.) how rich 118 is, how big are his
colounadae, up and down which he drives
for his amusement, what woods 01· 5111111)-
beries 118 has in which he is carried about
in 1115 lectica or sella, that he had whole
acres of ground near the Forum, and owned
many houses. The gardens of some private
persons, such for instance as Maecenas and
Sallust, were very large. The immediate
neighbourhood of the Forum was covered
with houses and public buildings, but be·
tween Mons Capitolinus and the Campus
Martius there was space for large gardens
such as Agrippa had there. They must be
very costly in such a neighbourhood, which
is what Juvenal means. There were pri-
vate as well as public covered walks and
drives (porticus) about the city. ‘ Fatigat’
is a poetical word 111 11115 connexion. Virgil
uses it (Aen. i. 316), “vel qualis equos
Threissa fatigat Harpalyce-'¹

9. Incestum] ‘ Incestum ' was what we
understand it, intercourse whether with or
without the pretence of marriage (which

Quid agas quum dira et foedior omni

was no marriage) between those who were
too near of kin to have ¹ connubium :' but
it went beyond this, and being an act
against religion, it embraced likewisc in-
tercourse with a vestal virgin. Iu such
cases the woman was buried and left to
starve in a cell in the Campus Sceleratus
in the Sixth Region of the city. Τ118 man
was put to death by scourging. Domitian,
as stated before (S. ii. 29, n.), revived the
law about vestals, but Juvenal says his
favourite, Crispinus, could break it with im-
punity, and had lately done so, though the
woman underwent the usual punishment.
‘ N uper‚’ however, does not limit the act to
a very short time before, though it was
probably not long. One of the first acts
after a vestal was convicted was to strip her
of her vitta, which all the virgins wore
when on duty. For ‘ vittata' Jahn reads
‘ vitiata,’ with 110 authority.

12. caderet subjudice morrena] This the
Seholiast explains rightly, ‘damnaretur a.
censore? So Claudian (iv. Cons. Hon. 88)
says, “ 11011 1105185 victore cadunt sed judice
sontes? ⁴ Cadere' has the same meaning
as in x. 69: “sed quo cecidit sub crimine?”
The ‘judex morum’ was the censor, aud
here means Domitian, who took that office
for his life, as mentioned in S. ii. 29. Τ118
proceeding that Juvenal is going to relate
should have brought the man under the
censor as the corrector of extravagance, a.
part of his duty being to enforce such
suinptuary laws as were in existence from
time to time. After Augustus they fell
into (1151158.

13. Titio Seioque] These names were
commonly used in legal 111-0888111085, and
mean no persons in particular here. He
calls them ⁸ bonis,’ the Scholiast sayS, de-
risively‚ and by comparison. To ‘decebat’
Heinrich prefers ‘decebit,' that is, ‘facile
decet 3 ' and the passage is so quoted by
John of Salisbury (Nugae, δια, 1. 4).
