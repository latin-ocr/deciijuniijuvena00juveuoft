hability of 111-111101οἐ story. It was
doubted 011 chronological grounds as far
back as the time of Plutarch (see Blakcs-
ley's note).

275. spatia ultima] This metaphor is
taken from the course in the Circus. ‘Ul-
tima spatia ' was the last circuit: the
plural is used because the chariots com-
monly went more than once round the
course (spatium). See below. v. 358.

276. Exsilium et carcer] He goes 011 10
5110111( of C. Marius, whom we have had
before (viii. 245, sqq.) as conqueror of the
Cimbri and Teutones, and triumphing on
that account, 13.c. 102. He was then fifty-
11110. In 110. 88, when Marius was in his
sixty·ninth year, he was obliged to fly from
Rome to escape from Sulla, and in his ssight
tried to hide himself in a marsh near Min-
turnae 011 the Liris. He was caught and
kept in custody for some time, bnt he was
allowed to escape by sea, 111111 110 went to
Carthage 115 Velleius says (ii. 19) “ inopem-
que vitam in tugurio ruinarum Carthagi-
niensium toleravit.” [Plutarch (Marius,
37—40) has also the story of Marius sit-
ting as a fugitive on the ruins of Carthage,
which may be founded 011 501110 common-
place in the declamatory exercises of the
⁴ imperial period.] The following year, his
party having gained temporary success, he

made a fearful example of his enemies, but

dinary activity. Sulla, when he got back
to nome, 111111 1110 ashes of Marius thrown
into the Anio.

280. Si circumducto] As to 1110 course
of the triumphal processioa see note on
Horace, Epod. vii. 8. The hiatus in v.
281 must be observed. Ruperti has given
a list of all in Juvenal on i. 151, V. L.
‘Animam opimam ’ may be rendered ‘his
full soul‚’ but an exact rendering is not 10
110 found. lt seems to involve a reference

to the ‘spolia 9pima,' and 15 particularly
suited to a conqueror. Horace has “ Sec-
tamur ultro quos opimus Fallere et effugere
est triumphus’' (C. iv. 4. 51). The ‘pompa'
is described above, v. 36, 11.

283. Provida Pompeio dederat] In the
year 13.c. 50 Pompeius, 111011 at the height
ofthis fortuncs, was attacked by a severe
11111055 at Neapolis. Prayers and sacrifices
were offered for his recovery; he did re-
cover, and the cities offered thanksgivings
and had a holiday on the occasion. Next
year Caesar crossed the Rubicon, Pompeius
had to fly for his life, and in the following
year (11.0. 48) 1051 it (see above, v. 108,
11.). Cicero, taking the same line of argu-
ment as Juvenal, asks whether if Pompeius
had then died he would have been parted
from happiness or misery Ρ Certainly (he
adds) from misery; for he would not have
warred with his father-indam he would
not have taken up arms unprepared, nor
left his home, nor fied from Italy, nor lost
his army, nor fallen into the hands and by
the sword of slaves3 1115 50115 would not
have pcrished nor his possessions have
been transferred 10 1115 conqueror. If 110
111111 died then he would have died in the
enjoyment of the largest prosperity; by
the prolonging of his life what a cup of
incredible calamities he drained! (Tusc.
Quaest. i. 35.) Juvenal may have had
this passage before him or not. He says
Campania, foresceing what was coming,
gave him a fever such as all might have
prayed for, but instead of that many cities
prayed that it might be removed, and
their prayers prevailcd. So his own fortune
and Rome’s preserved him, but only to be
beaten and lose his head. On the Fortuna
of Rome Plutarch has a treatise. Indi-
viduals, too, had their Fortuna, which was
diflerent from their Genius. (See Intro·
duction to Hor. C. i. 35, addressed to For-

tuna.) ‘Vincere' is the usual word for
prevailing in prayer.
