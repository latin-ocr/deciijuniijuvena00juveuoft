They were much admircd hy the ancients⁵‚ and have inci-n abun-
dantly quoted hy (li-ammafinius, by Fatliers of the Church, :nul
mediaeval writers. If certain passages au¹ less familiar to modern
ears thau their fitncss for quotation might lead us to expect, it is froin
the difficulties of the poetry, which have deteri-ed men of our ‹lay from
reading it as it deservcs. The subject of the first sarrire, which (leals
with the viciens poetical taste of the day, and has many quotations from,
or imitations of, the verses of contemporary writers, would be more in-
teresting and intelligible when it was first published than it is to us,
and this Satiro alone would create a large demand for the volume. The
Epistle to Macrinus comcs more home to oursclvcs as dealing with the
worship of Gal, the selfish or worldly abuse of which is common to all
ageS. The introductiou Ι have prefixed to the third Satire may per-
haps lead some to read it w'ith curiosity, and they will not be disap-
pointed. The more I read it, the more I admirc it. Seis-ignorance is
a large subject, which might be better handled than it is in the fourth
Satire3 and the folly of running after and hoarding money to be squan-
dered by one’s heirs is not done as much justice to in the sixth as it
probably would have been if the poet had finished it. The fifth is
generally considered the best in the book, though I myself prefer the
third. In the fifth there is that tribute to the goodness of Cornutus
which proves the goodness of the writer and the gracefulness with which
he could write. It also shows more of the philosophical school in
which Persius had been trained, without however introducing any thing
more new than the Stoic doctrine that the only free man is the
sage, with which Cicero and Horace had before made their readers
familiar. There are more imitations of Horace in this Satire than in
any other.

A writer of satire may be ‘ferus et violens’ with his pen, and yet
very amiable in manners, as the Grammarian describes Persius to have
been. He may also in those days have been chaste and modest, and yet
have used language for the exposure of vice which now cannot be used,
or even read without discomfort. There is nothing in Persius' style to
contradict the pleasing description given of him by his biographer, which
probably was quite true. More than one gem now in existence has

⁴ J ul. Scaliger thought Persius wrote obscurely on purpose that sools might adinirc
him. He is very severe on Persius. (See Scal. I’oct. vi. c. 6, iii.c. 97.)
⁵ Quintilian (x. 1. 94) sayS, “ Multum et verae gloriae, quamvis uno libro, Persius
meruit.'' Martial (iv. 29) says,
“ Saepius in libro numeratur Persius uno
Quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.”
