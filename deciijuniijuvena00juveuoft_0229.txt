Quum perimit saevos classis numerosa tyrannos!

Nam quaecunque sedens modo legerat haec eadem stans
Pcrferet atque cadem cantabit versibus isdem.

Occidit miseros crambe repetita magistros.

Quis color et. quod sit causae genus atque nbi summa 155

Nosse velint omnes, mercedem solvere nemo.

times, Domitius Aser and Julius Africanus,
were natives os Gaul. [‘ Ponere linguae,’
P. and Ribbeck.]

150. Declamare doces ?] He speaks of
those who taught rhetoric, one of the usual
elements of a Roman’s education, and ad-
miree the patience and iron nerves of these
teachers in listening to the dcclamations of
their classes. Vettius Valens was celebrated
as a physician, as one of the paramours of
the Empress Messalina, and the founder of
a new school of rhetoricians. (Pliny, H. N.
xxix. 1.) This may be the man whose name
is taken for the class. The destruction of
tyr-ants and the praises of those who had
killed them appear to have been common
subjects for declamation.

152. Nam quaeeunque sedens] The class
read their declamations sitting, and stand-
ing up repeat them again from beginning to
end. This is the meaning of ‘ pcrferet,’ as
in S. vi. 392 : “ dictataque verba Pertulit,
ut mos ostss’ They learnt to read as well
as to declaim‚ and made a drawling business
of both. ‘ Versus’ applies to the lines in
prose as well as poetry (see Porcell.).

154. crambe repetita] κράμβη 15 cab—
bage5 and to be helped twice to cabbage,
according to a proverb given by the Scho-
liast, was fatal ε δὶς κράμβη θάνατος.

155. Quis color et quod sit] He says all
want to leam the art of rhetoric, but no one
wants to pay the tencher. ‘ Color ' means
the arguments or oratorieal tricks used to
give a colouring to a bad case. The word
is used above, vi. 280 = ‘⁸ Die aliquem sodes
hic, Quintiliane, colorem-'³ ‘Causae genus’
means the class to which the case belongs.
Aristotle (Rhet. i. 3, init.) distinguishes
speeches by three forms (εἴδη), according
to the quality of the hearers, for, says he,
the τέλος (01· end) of the speech is the
bearet-3 and the hearer must be either a
mere auditor or a judge, and judges sit
either iu a judicial or a deliberative charac-
ter. Hence 119 calls the three kinds of

speechcs συμβουλευτικόν (deliberative),
δικανικόν (thrensic), and ἐπιδεικτικόν (for
display). Cicero adopted this distinction
and the grounds of it. He says in his
dialogue de l'artitione Oratoria, c. 3:
“ Quid habes igitur de causa dicere Ρ Audi-
torum eam genere distingui. Nam aut
auscultator est modo qui audit, aut discepta-
tor, id est rei sententiaeque moderator, ita ut
aut delectetur aut statuat aliquid. Statuit
autem de praeteritis ut judex 3 aut de futuris
ut senatus. Sic tria sunt genera, judicii,
deliberationis, exornationis, quae quia in
laudationes maxime confertur proprium
habet jam ex eo nornen.'’ The third class
came to be called by the Romans ‘enco-
miastic’ or ‘ laudatory.' V. Quint. iii. 3:
“ Partes enim rhetorices 9559 dicebant 1311-
dativam, deliberativam, judicialein; quae
si partes sunt, materiae sunt potius quam
artis. Itaque quidam genera tria rhetorices
dicere maluerunt : optime autem ii quos se-
cutus est Cicero [qui] genera ca·usarum.'’
‘Summa quaestio' is the prineipal question
at issue. ‘ Sagittae' are the adversary's
arguments. The MSS. have ‘volunt,’ ex-
cept P., which has ‘velunt,' from which
the editor of that MS. (Pithoeus) got the
true reading ‘velint.' [Ribbeck has ‘di-
versae forte sagittae.']

158. Mercedem appellas? qnid enim
ecio ἲ] The pupil says this. “ Do you
ask for your pay Ρ why, what have 1
learnt ?'’ ‘Appellare’ is a technical word
for demanding paynient. When Cicero
uses the word it is with the debtor as the
object, as in his speech Pro P. Quintio (c.
11)= “Quem nunc interficere nefarie
cupis, eum tum pudenter appellare nolebas”
(see Long's note).

159. laeva inpar-te mamillae] That is,
in his heart, which the Romans, as it
seems, held to be the scat of the under-
standing. Juvenal says, of course it is
laid to the fault of the teacher that the
blockliead has no wit in him. The Ar-
