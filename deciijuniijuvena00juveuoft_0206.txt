Divitibus responsa dabunt Phryx augur et Indus

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

585

Conductus, dabit astrorum mundique peritus
Atque aliquis senior qui publica fulgura condit ε
Plebeium in Circo positum est ct in aggere fatum.
Quae nudis longum ostendit cervicibus aurum,

Consulit ante phalas delphinorumque columnas,

590

An saga vendenti nubat caupone relicto.

Hae tamen et partus subeunt discrimen et omnes
Nutricis tolerant fortuna urgente labores :
Sed jacet aurato vix ulla puerpera lecto.

Tantum artes hujus, tantum medicamina possunt,

595

Quae steriles facit atque homines in ventre necandos

Conducit.

Gaude, infelix, atque ipse bibendum

Porrige, quidquid erit: nam si distendere vellet
Et vexare uterum pueris salientibus, esses

Aethiopis fortasse pater : mox decolor heres

600

Impleret tabulas, nunquam tibi mane videndus
Transeo suppositos et gaudia votaque saepe

585. Phryx* auyur et Indus] The rich
keep a seer 111 their own pay. Cicero
mentions the Phrygians among other
Eastcrns as dealing in this art (De Div. i.
41). ‘ Mundus ² is ‘the sky? (See Forcell.)
‘Fulgura’ or ‘fulmina condere’ was the
phrase for the ceremony by which places
struck by lightning or thunderbolts were
purified. Such a place was called ‘ biden-
tal? (See Persius, ii. 27, n.) The persons
employed 011 11115 ceremony were called
from it ‘fulguratores’ (See Forcell.) As
to ‘aggere,' see S. v. 153, and viii. 43.
[Ribbeck has ‘Indi,' and omits v, 586.
ΡΣω and Jahn have ‘ inde ³ for ‘ Indus.']

589. Quae nudis lonfflctn] This is any
common prostitute. As to ‘aurum,' see
above, v, 122: “ nuda papillis constitit
[Ribbeck has ‘ armum' in place
‘ Pbalae' (or ‘falae‚' as

auratis.”
of ί1111101113]
Forcellini has it) and ‘delphinorum colum-
nae ' are here spoken of as different things.
Heinrich says ‘ phalae ' were pillars at each
end of the Circus course supporting the
‘ ova ' and the dolphins. According to
Servius, on Virgil, Aen. ix. 705, they were
moveable towers on which fights took
place. There was certainly a pillar on
the ‘spi11a,' 01· wall that ran down the
course, supporting figures of dolphins in
honour of Neptune, as may be seen in the
woodcut in Smith's Dict. Ant„ Art. ‘ Cir-
cus,' and two others, supporting a number

of wooden balls (ova), which were taken
down one by one as the chariots went
round the course, to mark the number
of times. Forcellini follows Servius' ex-
planation.

591. An saya vendenti] She wants to
know whether she shall marry the clothes-
man 01· the victualler.

592. Hae tamen] The poorer sort, how-
ever, bad as they are, do sometimes bear
children and nurse them, for their con-
dition obliges them to this (fortuna ur-

gente). But rich ladies will not breed ς
they carry off all they conceive by abortive
drugs. ‘ Hujus' is as if the woman was

present who contracts (conducit) for this
business. ‘Infelix' is the husband, who
ought to be glad to give the drug himself
rather than become the reputed father of
a black boy, such as you would count
ominons if you met him in the morning
as you stepped out of your door.

After 601 111 0118 MS„ but after 614 in a
few 0111815, 1118 three feeble monkish lines
which are not worth repeating. Jahn has
them in his Var. Lect.

602. Transeo suppositos] See S. iii. 114 ι
“ Transi Gymnasia atque audi facinus
majoris abollae.” He passes on to another
point, the practice of women putting off
supposititious children upon their hus-
bands as their own. Ruperti says ‘tran-
seo' is ‘praetereo silentio ς’ so he inter-
