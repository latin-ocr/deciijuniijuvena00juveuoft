A. PERSII FLACCI

Centum ora et linguas optare in carmina eentum,
Fabula seu moesto ponatur hianda tragoedo,
Vulnera seu Parthi ducentis ab inguine ferrum.
“ Quorsum haec? aut quantas robusti carminis offas 5
IngeriS, ut par sit centeno gutture niti?
Grande locuturi nebulas Helicone legunto,
Si quibus aut Prognes aut si quibus olla Thyestae
Fervebst, saepe insulso coenanda Glyconi.

Tu neque anhelanti coquitur dum massa camino

Folle premis ventos nec clauso murmure raucus

repeat the lamentations of Meleager's
sisters (Met. viii. 532). Valerius Flaccus
could not count the Scythians with a
thousand mouths (vi. 36). The commen-
tators bring up from Macrobius (Sat. vi.
3), “Non si mihi linguae Centum atque
ora sient totidem vocesque liquatae,'' which
he quotes from the Histric war of Hostius,
a poet of whom little is known. No one
who considers the poverty of the Latin
Epic ean be surprised at this common-
place bombast being often repeated. We
have it in Silius Italicus, who was a con-
temporary of Persius. Claudian of course
has it more than once (In Probini et
Olybrii Consulatum, 55. De Sexto Cous.
Honorii Augusti, 436).

3. ponatur hianda tragoedo,] As to
‘ponatur’ see S. i. 70. 86, n.‚ and on
‘ hianda,’ which has reference to the
tragic mask‚ see Juv. vi. 636, n.‚ “ Grande
Sephocleo carmen bacchamur hiatu.''

4. Vulnera Seu Parthi] Heinrich says
‘ vulnera ³ means the wounds the inan iu-
flicts, and ‘fei-rum,’ the scimitar carried
by the Persians (“ Medus acinaces,'' Hor.
C. i. 27. 5). The Scholiast quotes Horace,
“Aut labentis equo descripsit vulnera
Parthi '’ (S. ii. 1. 15) 3 he therefore under-
stood it differently, supposing the man
to be wounded and to draw the point of the
arrow that shot him from his groin. This
I think is right. Casaubon and Jahn take
‘vulnera' actively‚ but ‘ferri' for an ar-
row hanging in its quiver by the man’s
side. The poems on the Parthians writ-
ten in Persius’ time, no doubt, were as full
of falsehoods as those which may have
suggested Horace's line above quoted.

5. Quorsum haec ?] His friend is sup-
posed to interrupt him, thinking he has
some grand poem in hand. ⁴ offas? which
Juvenal uses in ways of his own (S. ii. 33;
xvi. 11), may here mean raw crude scraps
of poetry of the robust or Epic sort. ‘ In-

geris ' may mean, ‘are you tossing us ' as
scraps of raw meat are thrown to a dog.
Below we have “Vigila et cicer ingere
large Rixanti populo'' (177). ‘Par’ means
that it befits the occasion, the means are
equa] to the end.

7. nebulas Helicone leyuntm] ‘Let
them gather fogs on Helicon.' Ovid in
the place above referred to (note on v. 1)
has

“Non mihi si centum deus ora sonantia
linguis,
Ingeniumque capax totumque Helicona
dedisset,” &c.

Here the νεφεληγερέται are tragic poets
telling of the supper Progne put before
Tereus, or Atreus before Thyestes. These
suppers the actor Glyco had to digest
pretty often. They were favourite sub-

jects. The Seholiast is the only authority

about Glyco, He says he was an actor of
Nero‘s time, which is an easy guess. Per-
sius thought him a stupid fellow.

10. Τιι neque anhelanti] These are the
great Epic poetS, who puff and blow with
their bellows to get the crude stuff into
shape. This is taken from Horace (S. i. 4.
19, sq.) :

“ At. tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras,
Usque laborantes dum ferrum molliat
ignis,
Ut mavis imitare.”

11. nec clauso murmure raucus] This
is the poet walking up and down, and
muttering something to himself which he
thinks fine, and looking like a fool as he
does so (iii. 81, n.). ‘ Cornicari'is to croak
like a raven. ‘Stloppus' is the sound
made by compressing the cheeks when
they have first been puffed out with wind.
Here it represents the mouthing and

ranting of tragic or epic poets repeating -

their productioris aloud.
