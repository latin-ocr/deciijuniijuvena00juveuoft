SATIRA 11. 223

The most corrupt inay therefore well despise these morulis-ts, and turn the nubles on
them, as Lauronia did when she heard one cry sor the Julian law : ⁴⁴ O happy timos
(cl-led she) with such a hulwark for its inorals! Lot the town blush, another Catu is
come down froin heaven! But whence, ραις, this perfumery? If yon must call oh!
laws up froin their rest, you'd better sammon the Scantinian first. Look at the ineu,
sor they are worse than we, but their cmnpact array and numbers save theim the
lewd will hang together: :nnong us nonght so detestable is found. Say, ‹h› we ambli«-
with the forum and the lau-s? A few, and bnt a few, are seen in the arena. But yon
will sit and spin and do our women's work better, yea than the best of us. &Vc all
know who was Ilister’s heir, and by what complaisance his wife got rich; and others
may do likewise. And yet we are condemned ς and censure sparos the raven to hunt
down the dove.'’ These Stoics flod confused before the truth of her rebuke.

V. 65. what will not others do when you put on those clothes of gauze and go and
preach before admiring crowds against the female sinners, Creticus Ρ They would at
least put on a decent toga if it came to that. “ But it is so hot‚'’ say you : why then
go naked; madness is less disgrucesul. Look at the dress in which, had yon lived
then, our hardy ancestors had seen you in the rostra. Would you not cry out,
“ Heaven and earth !'' if you saw a judex so attired ‚⁹ How would a witness look in
clothes like these? And yet you, stern unbending Stoic, go transparent 1

V. 78. The infection has spread, and will farther spread, like inurrain among sheep. or
scurf in pigs‚ or contagious rot from grape to grape. You will go on to something
worse than this. The height of wickedness is reached by slow degrees. Soon we
shall see you among those who mock the rites of Bona Dea, driving out the women,
and keeping up such orgies as the Baptae tire Cotytto with. They wear long garlands
on their heads and jewels on their neck, and sacrifice, and pour libations. Here one
paints his eyebrows and makes his eyes look languishing: another drinks from an
obscene glass with his long locks tied up in a net of gold, with a handsome tunic,
while his slave swears by his master's J uno! Another holds a mirror to his face such
as vile Otho carried when he went to the wars; a novel piece of furniture for a camp Ι
Of course it is a great man’s part to kill a tyrant—and to mind his skin; to aim at
empires-and to smooth his face. Semiramis and Cleopatra did not so. Here is no
reverence for the table, none ς but Cybele‘s foul licenee and the languishing voice, a
sanatio high priest with his white hair, rare glutton he and master of his art. Long
since they should have cut their useless partS, as the Phrygian priests are wont.

V. 117. Gracchus his portion brought to a trumpeter: the marriage deeds were signed;
the bloesiug spoken 3 the feast prepared ς the new bride lay upon his husband's bosom.
Ye nobles! need we the censor or the haruspex here? What if a woman ealved or a
cow lambed ? you'd shudder more and count them greater monsters. The priest of
Mars who sweated with the ancilia puts ou a brida] dress! Gradivus, whence this
shame to Latin shepherds? whence have thy sous this itch P A man of birth and
wealth marries a man, and yet thy wrath is still! quit then the plain which thou dost
so neglect. “1 must be up betimes, and do my duty by the Quirinal.'' “ What duty ?’'
“What duty Ξ why my friend will take a husband—the marriage will be private.'’
But soon there’ll be no privacy, they'll want to put it in the news. And yet they
must die barren (this torments them), in spite of herbs and the anercus’ blows.

V. 143. But this is less than noble gladiators, who scour the arena, better born than all
the fine folk who look on by the podium, yea than the great man too who gives the
gamae. The fables about manes, Styx, and Charon’s boat we leave to babes. But
only think them true, and what would all those mighty spirits say when such a
shade came down! They'd cry for lustral water, sulphur, pine, and laurel.

V. 159. So changed are we, alas ! Our arms are carried to the furthest North, but those
barbariam do not what their conqueror-s do. Yet one, Armenian zalates, more sos t
