Haud impunitum quondam fore, quod dubitaret

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Depositum retinere ct fraudem jure tueri

Jurando : quaerebat enim quae numinis essct
Mens, ct an hoc illi facinus suaderet Apollo,
Reddidit ergo metu 11011 moribus ; ct tamen omnem

Vocem adyti dignam templo veramque probavit

205

Exstinctus tota pariter 011111 prole domoque

Et quamvis longa deductis gente propinquis.
Has patitur poenas peccandi sola voluntas.
Nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum

Facti crimen habet.

Cedo si conata peregit?

Perpetua anxietas nec mensae tempore cessat,
Faucibus ut morbo siccis, interque molares
Difficili crescente cibo : sed vina misellus

and his moral is οὕτω ἀγαθὸν μηδὲ διανοέεσ-
θαι περὶ παρακαταθήκης ἄλλο ’γε ἦ ἀπαιτεόν-
των ἀποδιδόναι. Τ1115 narrative Juvenal has
made good uscos, I think; but Mr. Blakes-
ley says it 15 1101 very aptly introduced, and
Ruperti says 1110 same. Juvenal advises
his friend to leave the man to the punish-
ment of the gods and his own conscience,
and hc produces a well-known story to
show that such crimes do 1101 go impun-
ished. This 15 to the purpose, and the
connexion is maintained 50 115 10 110 (111110
intelligible.

200. quod dubitaret Depositum reti-
nere] We should say ‘dubitavit reddere‚’
he 110511111οᾶ about restoring. But he also
hesitated about keeping the money, and
that was his offence. [In v. 208 Ribbeck
has ‘saeva' for ‘sola.' ‘Saeva' is the
reading of P. and some other M SS.]

209. Nam scelus intra se tacitum] Gif-
ford is persuaded Juvenal could not have
got this sentiment without the light of
Christianity, in the moral teaching of
which no doubt it is a fundamental rnlc.
But the ethics of Christianity are 110 new
invention. They do but enforce the teach-
ing of conscience, which has only 10 be
free and it will tell a man, without further
revelation, that evil desires are sin, espe-
cially in the case that Juvenal supposes,
where cowardice not principle (moribus, v.
204) prevents the aecomplishment of them.
(See Introduction.)

[The Roman law adopted the principle
of punishing forthe intention to commit a
crime, just the same as if the crime were
committed. But as a man's intention
(voluntas) cannot be discovered unless he

shows it by some act, the law properly
looked 1ο what the man did 115 1110 evidence
of what hc intended to do; and accordingly
if he failed to do what 1115 1101 showed that
he intended 10 do, he was punished just as
if hc had accomplished his purpose. See
Cicero pro Milone, c. 73 Dig. 48. 8. 1. § 3,
and 48. 8. M]

210. Cedo si conata peregit ?] “ Come
tell me what if he has accomplished his
purpose ,9³⁵ He means Calvinus’ man.
‘Cedo ' is used in S. vi. 504 in this way
(500 note). The man's condition under
the effeets of a bad conscience is powerfiilly
imagined: anxiety haunts him at meal
times, his meat seems tough and sticks to
his fevered jaws and appears to swell as
he tries to bite it3 the finest wine is sour
to his taste ; and if you offer him still bet-
ter, his brow nevertheless is contracted
with inward pain. If he goes to sleep for
a moment, he begins to dream of the altars
by which he has perjured himself, and the
image of the man he has wrong-ed comes
up preternaturally large to frighten and
make him confess his guilt. He trembles
at every flash of lightning and the first
faint sound of thunder, and thinks the
storm is sent in wrath to judge him. If it
passes he thinks the calm is a momentary
lull to be succeeded by 11 worse tempest ς
every sickness takes the form of a message
of anger from heaven: he dare not even
sacrifice when he is ill, for how can he ex-
pect to be accepted Ρ

213. Difficili crescente cibo .·] This ex-
presses a common feeling which 1 have
never seen expressed in modern books, the
jaws weary with weakness and want of ap-
