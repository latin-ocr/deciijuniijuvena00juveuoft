manag-er of the property, and the ‘dis-
pensator‚’ who was steward of the house-
hold.

46. Sed tu sane] This 15 3150 to 111511135-
ter. “But you thought vourself a (¹ any-
mcde whose favours are enoug h without
payment. How much would you and
your like give to a client who {sill give
nothing even to him who ministers to
your passions?” The full form ‘assecula’
(assecla) is only used here, unless it be the
true reading in Cic. pro P. Sestio, e. 64.
It has the same root as ‘sequor,’ and
means a sollower. ‘ Cultor ' has the 531119
meaning. ‘ Morbo' is his lust, and is put
for the man who serves his lust. Juvenal
has “qui vultu morbum incessuque fate-
tur '⁹ (ii. 17, where see note), and “ morbo
pallet utroque ” (ii. 50), where corrupt
passinus are ineant, as in Horace, C. i. 37.
9: “ contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum.” Seneca (Ep. 83), speak-
ing of drunkenness, says in that state

“impudicus morbum confitetur ae publi-

ca'’t, and Catullus says (C. lvii. quoted by
Mitscherlich on Hor. l. c.):

“ Pulchre convenit improbis cinaedis
Mamurrae pathicoque, Caesarique.—
Mox-bosi pariter, gemelli utrique.'’

The word does not appear to hare been
used in this sense generally in Cicero's
time, for he says (Tusc. Qu. iii. 4) ε “ Num
reliquae quoque perturbationes animi, for-
miffines, libidines, iracundiae? hacc enim
fere sunt ejusmodi quae Graeci πάθη

appellant ς ego poteram morbos, et id ver-

bum esset e verbo 3 sed in consuetudinem

nostram non caderet: nam misereri, inri-
dere, g‘estirc, laetari, hacc omnia morbos
Graeci appellant motus animi rationi non
ol›temperantes; nos autem hos eosdem
motus concitati animi recte ut opinor per-
turbationes dixerimus : morbos autem non
satis usitate ;'' on which Gronovius ol)-
servcs “postea usitatius factum '' (on Sen.
de Ben. i. 14, “morbo sno morem gessit‚''
3 long note which enters largely into the
use of this word). ‘ J :un ’ is used for em-
phasis as the Greeks used δή. [Ribbeck
omits vv. 48, 49.]

50. En cuitu viridem] This is 3 burst

of scorn connected with vv. 46, 47. “ See
(says the man) a delicate creature to whom
you may send pres ents on his birthday or
on the Kalends of Man-.h” ‘T'u is any
one who wants to use him. He speaks of
Virro as if he were a woman. Roman wo-
men, like the Greek, used parasols very
commonly, carried usually, but not always,
by a slave as 111 the East (see Dict. Ant.).
As to ‘succina’ see vi. 573, n.; and as to
‘cathedra’ see i. 65, n. What he calls
‘femineis Kalendis’ were the Kalends of
Mai-eh when the Mater-naha were held, a
feast at which women received presents
from their husbands (see note on Hor. C.
iii. 8: “Martiis coelebs quid agam Ka·
lendis’'). 'l'he MSS. with one exception
have ‘tractas’ (v. 53), and Heinrich has
that reading and defends it. Ι think
‘tractat,’ which is in a Paris MS. of the
ninlh century aud 111 Servius’ quotation of
this verse on Aen. viii. 638, is the right
word. 'l'he person represented is the man
countiug over all his private presents as a
woman would do, reclining in a woman’s
‘ cathedra?
