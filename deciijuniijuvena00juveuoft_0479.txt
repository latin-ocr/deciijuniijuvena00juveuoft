“ Dave, cito (hoc credas jubeo) finire dolores

149. quos hie quincunce modesto] The
legal interest was twelve per cent. per an-
num. (Juv. ix. 7, n.) Five per cent.
therefore was moderate interest3 but it is
better, Self-indulgence says, than a greedy
ele-ven per cent. got with so much labonr.
We may inser from this, that money could
not be lent on good security at this time
at a higher rate of interest than five per
cent„ though twelve per cent. might
legally be taken. Jahn and others quote
in connexion with ‘ nutrieras ' “nummos
alienos pascet,'¹ in Horace, Epp. i. 18. 35.
But. it is nothing to the purpose here.
Heinrich's remark is more to the purpose,
that the capital is looked upon as the
mother of the interest, wherefore the
Greeks called it τόκος. ‘Pei-agant su-
dare’ is to go on till they have sweated
eleren per cent„ which is coarser in
English than in Latin. All the editors
but Heinrich have ‘pergant' on small
authority.

151. Indulge Genio,] See note 011 S. ii.
3, “Funde merum Genio.’' ‘To indulge
your Genius’ is only another expression
for indulging yourself. ‘Luxuria’ goes
on, ‘ Let us enjoy all that is pleasant, all
we can call our own is the moment we are
living.’ 'l'hough this is general he ex-
presses it by the second person 1ιι ‘ vivis ε’
‘vivimus' or ‘vivitur' would be more
regular. ‘Quod vivis’ might be ‘qnod
tempus vivis,' an expression like that of
Juvenal (xii. 128), “ Vivat Pacuvius quaeso
vel Nestora totum.” Jahn takes it dif-
ferently. ‘Yon owe it to me that you
live, i. e. revera vita frueris-X which is
wrong. ‘Manes et fabula' are meant to

be taken as identical. See note on Juve-
nal, S. ii. 149. Heinrich encloses ν. 153
in brackets, and it may well be so left.
It is feeble and redundant, a monkish
marginal verse that has got into the text.
There is no reason to suppose Jerome
refers to it in the place quoted hy Jahn.
[Comp. Horace, C. i. 11. 7, “ Dum loqui-
mur, fugerit invida Aetas.'']

151. En quid aslis Ζ] The poet goes on
again. He likens the man in his dilemma
to a fish with two hooks in his mouth,
while he struggles to get free of one he
gets more fixed by the other. ‘Duplici
hamo' is like ‘duplice ficu‚’ a couple of
figs, Horace. S. ii. 2. 1:22. [The ‘duplex
fieus’ of Horace seems to he a fig split
open from the broad end, and left with
the two other ends attached: another fig
split open in the same way is then placed
on it, so that the two insides fit. This
makes a pair of figs adhering together.
Such tigs may now be seen in the island ot'
Ischia near Naples.] The only solution
of the man's difficulty is that hc must obcy
them alternately. ‘Ancipiti obsequio’ is
like ‘Mars anceps,’and means un obedit-nce
rendered first to one and then to the other.
‘ Oherrare' is ‘ to run away! ‘ Instanti ' is
‘ threatening?

161. Dare, cilo (hoc credas ιφἰιόε>ο)]
Here wc have another slave. Like Horace
(S. ii. 3. 259, sqq), Persius has imitated
the tirst scene 1ιι the Eunuchus of
Terence in part of the following dialogne.
For l’armeno in the play we have here
Davus, and sor Phaedria, Chaerestratus,
who begins by say-ing he means to put an
end to his grief and his ,profligate wny
