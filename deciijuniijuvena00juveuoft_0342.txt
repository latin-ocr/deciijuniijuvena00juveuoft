292 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 86. Some say chance governs all things, nature rules the world, and 50 they fearless
go to any altar. Others believe in gods and punishment, but argue thus: “ Let them
(lo with my body what they will, and strike me blind, so that I keep my gains. We
may bear all for that. Ladas if poor will pray for the rich man’s gout, unless he be
insane. The racer’s barren cr0wn‚ what does he get by that Ρ The gods may punish,
but they punish slow : my turn will not be yet ; besides it may be they will pardon me 3
the fault is venial. It’s all 3 chance, one gains a cross hy his crimes and one a crown.’'
’Tis thus they quiet conscience, put a bold face upon it, go to the altar of their own
accord, abuse or beat you for mistrusting them, and get believed for their audacity.
And so they act their farce, while you cry out with voice like Stentor or like Mars,
‘⁶ Jove, hearest thou 111 silence Ρ thy do we bring thee sacrifice and incense? As
far as I can see your statues are no better than Vagellius'.'’

V. 120. Now take such comfort as you may from one unread in an philosophy. Patients
in danger may consult great doctors, do you submit to a humbler. If you 0311 prove
there never was a crime so bad in all the world, I hold my peace, mourn as you
will ς I know the loss of money is a greater grief than loss of kindred; in that 0350
mourning is not feigned, the 10315 310 real. But if it's every where the same that men
deny their hand and seal, are you, fine gentleman, to be excepted ,⁹ How do you make
yourself the ehick of a fine bird and us the produce of a humble nest Ρ It's bnt a small
thing after all if you compare it with the greater crimes, the hired assassin, the incen-
diary, the sacrilegious robber who plunders templeS, or the petty thief who scrapes
the gold from statues3 the poisoner, the parricide. How small a part is this of all
the crimes the praefect listens to from morn till night ! His court alone will teaeh
you what men are. Spend 3 few days there and talk about your misery if you
dare.

V. 162. None wonder at swelled throats in the Alps, coarse breasts in Egypt, or blue
eyes and yellow curly hair in Germany, because they are all the same. So no one
among the pigmies laughs at their battles with the 0131105, though they are only a
foot high.

V. 174. “ But must not pei-jury and fraud be punished ?'' Suppose him carried off and
put to death, your loss is still the same, and all you get is odium and a drop of blood
shed from a headless eorpse.

V. 180. ‘¹ Oh! but revenge is pleasanter than life.” This is fools' language, who flare
up for nothing. Chrysippus, Thales would not say so, nor Socrates, who would not
share his cup of poison with his enemy. Philosophy corrects our faults of nature and
of practice ε 5110 first taught 115 right from wrong, for only little minds care for revenge,
as you may see from women's love of it.

V. 192. But why think they escape whom conscience whips Ρ Their punishment is worse
than any down in hell, who night and day carry their witness with them. Τ110 Spartan
once tempted the oracle and gothis answer, which the event established, for he and all
his house though old have perished. Such was the penalty of 3 1)3(1 desire. For he
who thinks to do au evil deed incurs the guilt as if he’d donc the deed. What if the
man 1135 03111οᾶ out his purpose Ρ Ceaseless anxiety haunts him at meals, parched
mouth, contracted brow 3 bad dreams, through which the altars 110 1135 sworn by pass,
and your tall ghost most terrible of all, and drives him to confession. ’Tis these
who tremble at the storm and think each bolt a messenger of wrath. If one storm
passeS‚ then they fear the next, and tremble at the calm that goes before it. Every
disease they count a stone or dart from heaven. They dare not sacrifice in
sickness ς what can the guilty hope for? What victim is not worthier to live than
they Ρ

V. 236. The wickcd commonly are changeable ς they are firm enough while they’re
