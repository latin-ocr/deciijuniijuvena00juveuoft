139. m'l animis in corpora juris] It is
well, he says, that nature grants their wills
no power over their bodies.

141. condita pyxide Lyda] This is an
old fat woman (turgida) professing to sell
drugs to cure barreuness, ‘ pyxide condita '
being a box full of such.

142. palmas praebere Luperca] The
Luperci were priests of the god Lupercus,
whose festival, the Lupercalia, was cele-
brated every year on the Ides of February,
from the earliest times to a late period of
the cmpire. Lupercus was the god of fer-
tility. At his festival the priests, among
other ceremonies, rau about the city with
thongs iu their hands cut from goats sacri-
ficed on the occasion, and with these they
struck any one who cainein their way, and
the effect was supposed to be the. gift of
fertility. They struck the people on the
back or ou the pallus of the hands. Ovid
makes Lupercus the same as Pan. (Fast.
ii. 266, sqq.) ‘Agili' is explained by the
activity of the priests, who put off their
clothes that they might run the quieker.

143. Vicit et hoc monstrum] He says that
even this monstrous viee is sur-passed by
the indignity offered to the nobility by their
members appearing as gladiators in the
arena of the amphitheatro. The ‘ retiarius,’
who was one of the many classes of gla-
diators, carried a net, which it was his
business to throw over the head of his ad-
versary if he could, and a three-pointed
spear, ‘ fuscina‚' which was another name
for Neptune's trident. He wore only a
tunic, and did not wear armour as the
Sanmites did. [Ribbeck omits vv. 143-
148, ¹ Vicit et hoc‚’ . . . to ‘ retia misitff]

145. Et Capitolinis generosior] Capito-
linus was a cognomen in the Quintia gens
and the Manlia. The latterderived it from
M. Manlius, who saved the Capitol from
the Gauls (A.u.c. 364), according to the

common tradition. Τ. Quintus Capitolinus
Barbatus, who was six times consul, aud
triumphed for his victories over the Aequi
and Volsci A.U.c. 286, was the first of
that family who bore it. 'l‘he dictator Cin-
cinnatus was of the same family, and was
called Capitolinus. The Marcelli were a
plebeian family of the Claudia gens. The
tirst was M. Marcellus, the conqueror of
Syracuse ΔΑΜ). 542. Hor. C. xi. 12. 45 :
“Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo Fama
Marcelli.'’ Catulus was the mnne of a fa-
mily belonging to the Lutatia gens, who
were plebeians. C. Lutatius Catulus, by
his naval victory over Hanno off the coast
of Sicily, brought the first Punic war to a
close, A.U.c. 513. Q. Lutatius was the
colleague of C. Marius, alluded to in viii.
253. He was afterwards included in Ma-
rius' proscription‚ and destroyed himself
A.U.C. 677. His son, who was first the
colleague of M. Aemilius Lepidus in the
consulship, and afterwards defeated him at
the head of the remains of Marius' party
ten years after his father’s death, was au
honest and able man, a staunch supporter
of Cicero. The l’auli best known in history
were of the patrician Aemilia gens. L.
Aemilius, who died at Cannae A.u.c. 538
(“animaeque magnae prodigum l’aulum,”
Hor. C. i. 12. 37), and his son Lucius, who
had the cognomen Macedonicus for his vic-
tory over Perseus, and triumphed for the
same ΔΑΜ). 587, were the most illustrious
of the family, but their distinction was
such that Juvenal speaks of all their (le-
scendants being ennobled by them. 'l'he
Fabia gens, which was patrieian, was dis-
tinguished in various families from the
earliest times of the republic. All the gens
was destroyed by the Veientes at the river
Cremera, A.U.c. 277, with the exception
of one man. See below, v. 153, n. The
name they then bore was Vibulanus, which
was dropped for Ambustus, and this was
lost in Maximus, earncd by Q. Fabius
Maximus Rullianus, the conqueror of the
Samnites in the second war. He was great-
grandfather to him who, for his tactics
