SATIRA I.

Nunc demum numero fluere, ut per leve severos

· Ell'undat junctura- ungues ⁸? scit tendere versum

Non secus ac si oculo rubricam dirigat uno.
Sive opus in mores, in luxum et prandia regum
Dicere, res grandes nostro dat Musa poetae.
Eece modo heroas sensus afferre videmus

on the feebleness of public taste, which
likes a smooth flow of words, and a poem
laid out as if with the eye of a earpenter
measuring his work with a red line. They
used a string coloured with verinilion just as
our carpenters use a ehulked line. ‘ Tendere ‘
is used for laying out in a straight line and
is appropriate to the rest ofthe passage. 1
do not think it has any thing to do with
adapting verses to music either here or in
Hor. S. ii. 1. 2, to which Heinrich refers
(see note there). ‘ Effundat ’ expresses the
unobstructed passage of the nail, like water
poured out.

67. Sive opus· in mores‚] ‘Sive’ is op-
posed to what goes before, in which it is
implied that the subject is of the softer sort.
But if he must change his theme, and write
of the manners and luxury of the age, still
our poet is the man, say they, for these
subjectS. 1 differ from Jahn, who says ‘sive'
has nothing going before to which it can be
referred iu the way of opposition. I think
also he is wrong in taking ‘ in ’ as represent-
ing only the subject of the man's poenis.
‘ Dicere in ’ is to speak against, and ‘ dicere
in mores‚’ ‘ in luxum,’ can only be to speak
against the manners aud luxury of the day.
Heinrich, Jahn, and others, take ‘ regum '
for the rich, a common use of the word ; and
they make it depend upon ‘mores, luxum,
prandia? Casaubon thinks ‘prandia’ re-
fers to such tragic subjeets as the dinner
of Thyestes or Tereus, common subjects of
tragedy (see S. v. 17). No doubt ‘regum ’
means ‘the rich? See Hor. S. ii. 2. 44:
“Necdum omnis abacta Pauperies epulis
re m.''

835¹). Ecce modo heroas sensus] ‘Ecce
modo’ is, ‘ Do but look i’ and he goes 011,
“ We see men presenting us with the feel-
ing-s of heroes on the strength of having
practised a little nonsense in Greek, men
who don’t know how to describe a wood, or
sing the praises of the country, its baskcts‚
its fireplaces‚ its pigs, its Palilia.’' ‘ Heroas’
is used as an adjective, as in Propertius

ῗ ii. 1. 18: “ Ut possem heroas ducere in

arma manus.'' Casaubon, Pussow, and
Heinrich prefer ‘heroos‚’ which is a legiti-
mate adJectivc, but has no authority here.

‘Afferre’ is to bring and put before us.
‘ Nugari solitos Graece' Casaubon and some
others take to mean that they were just
from school. There is a reading of good
MSS. ‘doeemus‚’ which Heinrich adopts in
support of that interpretation. ‘ Ponere ’ is
used in Horace, C. iv. 8. 8: “ Sollers
nnnc hominem ponere nunc deum,'’ and
A. P. 34: “Infelix operis sumina quia
ponere totum Nesciet,'’ with reference to
the works of sculptors and painters, and
here Persius uses it for poetry, as below
sor flowers of rhetoric (v. 86). 011 ‘ ponere
artifices‚' see Prol. 11, 11. ‘Saturum’ is
only a poet’s epithet for the country—rich,
fertile. See Virg. Georg. ii. 197: ‘⁶ Satu-
rum Tarentum.'' From other character-
istics of the country he chooses the most
obvious and commonplace, such as those
poets commonly noticed, as baskets (of
which a quaint representation may be seen
in Dict. Ant„ art. Corbis), fireplaccS, which
Horace found more comfortable in the
country than in the town (S. ii. 3. 10, n.:
‘¹ Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto”)‚
pigs, and the Palilia. This was the shep-
herd's holiday, held on the 2lst of April,
described by Ovid (Fast. iv. 731). ‘ Fu-
mosa foeno ' is explained by Ovid (Fast. iv.
781, SQ.) :

“ Moxque per ardentes stipulae crepitantis
acervos
Trajicias celeri strenua membra pede.”

The shepherds made fires of hay and straw
and jumped through the flames by way of
amusement. So Tibullus says (ii. 5. 89) :

“ Ille (pastor) levis stipulae sollennes potus
Αοῗῐῐῗέἓέ flammas transilietque sa-

cras ;”

and Propertius (v. 4. 77, sq. Paley):

“ Cumque super raros foeni flammantis
acervos
Trajicit immundos ebria turba pede8.'’

Jahn takes ‘lucum ’ for the grove of Mam,
notieed by Juvenal (i. 7). This destroys
the sense of the whole passage.
