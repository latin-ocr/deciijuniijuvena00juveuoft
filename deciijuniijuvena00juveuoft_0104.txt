D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Usque adeo nihil est, quod nostra infantia caelum

Hausit Aventini, bacca nutrita Sabina?

Quid, quod adulandi gens prudentissima laudat
Sermonem indocti, faciem deformis amici,

Et longum invalidi collum cervicibus aequat
Herculis, Antaeum procul a tellure tencntis,

Miratur vocem angustam, qua deterius nec

Ille sonat quo mordetur gallina marito.
Haec eadem licet et nobis laudare 3 sed illis

Creditur.

An melior quum Thaida sustinet, aut quum

Uxorem comoedus agit vel Dorida nullo

Cultam palliolo? hlulier nempe ipsa videtur

Non persona loqui ε vacua et plana omnia dicas
Infra ventriculum et tenui distantia rima.

(H. N. xiii. 5) says ‘ cottona ' was the name
of small figs from Syria. He also speaks
in the same place of plums from Damascus,
of which both were well known to the
Italians (utramque jam familiarem Italiae).
Martial mentions the kind of baskets in
which ‘ cottona' were imported, conical-
shaped wicker-baskets (xiii. 28) :

“Haec tibi quae torta venerunt condita
meta ,- .
Si majora forent cottona ficus erant.''

To these imported fruits the ‘bacca Sa-
bina ' is opposed,-—the olive grown on the
Sabine hills, where they still grow in abnn-
dance. The Aventine is put for Rome as
the Esquiliae and Viminal were above.
‘ Hausit caelum ' is borrowed from virgil,
Aen. x. 899 : “ ut auras Suspiciens hausit
caelum mentemque recepit.'' Ruperti adopts
the reading of a few MSS„ ‘Aventinum.’
Either form will do.

86. Quid, quod adulandi] Ι have re-
moved the note of interrogation that gene-
rally appears after ‘quid' See below, v. 147.
It introduces another illustration of the
subject, a common use of ‘quid’ and ‘quid
enim? (See Hor. S. i. 1.7‚ note.) Cicero
cautious his brother Quintus particularly
against the Greeks in his province (Asia).
A very few, he sayS, were worthy of old
Greece: “Sic vero (as times now go) fal-
laces sunt permulti et leves et diuturna
servitute ad nimiam assentationem eruditi.”
(Ad Qu. Fr. i. 1. 5.)

88. collum cervicibus aequat] ‘ Collum ’
signifies the whole neck before and behind,
including the throat, ‘ cervix ³ the hinder

by Cicer-03 and Quintilian remarks (viii. 3)
that it appears more commonly in that
number than the singular (see Forcellini).
Antaeus, the giant wrestler of Libya, was
beaten by Hercules only by lifting him up
from his mother earth, from whom he got
all his strength, and so squeezing him to
death. There were many pictures and
sculptures representing the scene3 and J u-
venal writes as if he had seen one. The
struggle is described with some power by
Lucan (iv. 597, sqq.).

91. quo mordetur yallina marita] There
cau be no doubt that the poets sometimes
used the construction of the ablative of the
agent without the preposition a, and that
‘ quo,' the reading of all the MSS„ is right.
See note on Hor. C. i. 6. 2. ‘Marito' is
put in 1118 ablative by attraction, as (Hor.
S. i. 4. 2) “Atque alii quorum comoedia
prisca virorum est ;” (lb. 10. 16) “Illi
scripta quibus comoedia prisca viris est.”

92. sed illis Creditum] ‘ We may flatter
just as they do, but they are believed (and
we are not).' They knew how to ad-
minister flattery so as to make a man believe
himself what they represented. An instance
of this is mentioned by Suetonius in the
life of Nero (c. 22). He had a great
opinion of his musical taletas, and paid a
visit to Greece in order to display them
there. He sang at a dinner party, and
being highly applauded, he is said to have
cried, “Solos scire audire Graecos, solosque
se et studiis suis dignos.”

93. An melior quum Thaida sustinet,]

plays a courtezan, or a chaste matron, or
