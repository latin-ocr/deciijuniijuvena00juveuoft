scholar. It has been lately republished by Duebner (Leipzig, 1⁵:31⁸),
with the text revised but not improved by this editor, who has
added to Casaubon’s notes the conssicting- opinions os other com-
montators. The notes of Lubinus are so wordy and cmharrassed
as to be quite uurcadablo. Plum and Koenig· have furnished the
world with long· commentarios, of which Plum’s is the better. Pas-
sow’s edition (Leipzig, 1509) is acc‹.›nipanied by a German trans-
lation, and a¹ eommentary in the same language on the first Satire.
In cases of difficulty I have not been able to rely upon his jndg-
ment. Orelli has given the text, scholia, and many of the various
readings of Persius in his Eclog‘ae Poetarum Latinorum. His text
is good, and I have never failed to consider it with respect. Every
editor who thinks as he ought, independently, will have his own
opinion of his author-’s meaning, and so will choose, out of many
that may have authority, that reading which best represents his
opinion. With this remark Ι disclaim any want of proper deference
to the scholarship of others more learned than myself. Scholarship
(of a certain sort) and learning· do not always go along· with judg-
ment ς sometimes they tend to obscure it ς nor are all editors
learned that contrive to seem so.

The scholia on this author, published with great care by Jahn,
are more numerous than those on Juvenal. They passed among·
scholars of the early time as the production of one person, and 110
110 other than Annaeus Cornutus, the teacher of Persius. It does
not require much discrimination to see that they are not from that
source, and do not contain a syllable that was written near the time
of the poet. J alin has taken great pains to show that they are the
work of a later Cornutus of the tenth century, who wrote a com-
mentary also on Juvenal. If this be so, he may have used notes of
earlier Grammarians than himself without acknowledgment. There
is a great deal of useful and a great deal of foolish matter in these
scholia.

Of the MSS, of Persius Jahn has mentioned and described sixty-
seven, of which the most memorable arc a fragment of the first
Satire‚ edited by Mai from the famous Vatican Palimpsest, and
two others of the ninth and tenth centuries which bear an inscrip-
