sure about this. The swords of thegladia·
tors in the woodcuts referred to are straight.
The ‘retiarius' thrcw his net, and if he
sailed to entangle his advers-ary, caught it
up and ran round the Circus, pursued by
the other, till he could get another oppor-
tunity of throwiug it. ‘ Spectacula ’ means
the ‘spectatores’ then a gladiator was
beaten he commonly held up his hand to
the spectators to plead for his life, which
depended upon their caprice. V. 202 any
body may see is an interpolation. [Rib-
beck omits

“ ct damnat et odit
Nec galea faciem abscondit.”]

207. Credamus tunicae] We may know
it is Gmcchus by his tunic, and the strings
(spira) of bis cap, which, as well as the
tunic, were embroidered with gold. We
are ,therefore to suppose this Gracchus to
be the man who married himself as a
woman to a trumpeter (ii. 117), for hc was
one of the Salii (ii. 124, n.), who wore
tunics embroidered in this way. Livy (i.
20) says they wore a eorslet of bronze.
‘Secutor' was another kind of gladiator
who was usually matched with the ‘re-
tiarius.’ ‘ Ergo' meam, since then he is
well known to be but a priest, the ‘ secu-
tor’ will only be disgraced by such an ad-
versar .

tutor to Nero, but had fallen under his
suspicion. The conspiracy was discovered,
and Seneca was charged with ,being a party
to it, and put to death with several others.
Tiberius, two years after he became cm-
pemr, put an eud to the little influence
for elections that Augustus left the comi-
tia ot' the centurie& “Tum primum e
Campo comitia ad Patres translata sunt ;
nam ad eain diem etsi potissima arbitrio
Principis quaedam tamen studiis tribuum
fiebant. Neque populus ademptum jus
questus est nisi inani rumore? (Tac.
Ann. i. 15.)

213. Cegjus supplicio] The punishment
for ‘parricidium’ from very early times
was that the criminal be scourged, and sewn
up iu a sack with a dog, a cock, a snake,
and a monkey, and thrown into the sea
(xiii. 155). See also Cic. pro Rosc. Am. c.
25, and Long’s notes and Introduction.
Juvenal says he deserved this many times
over. He put to death his mother Agrip-
pina at the instigation of his mistress Pop-
paea Sabina, ΑΛ). 59. Three years after-
wards he divorced, banished, and inurdered
his wife Octavia, and having married Pop·
paea killed her in a fit of rago. Hc also
caused to be put to death, because she
would not marry him, Antonia, his sister
by adoption, being the daughter os Claudius,
who adopted Nero and made hiin his heir,
to the exclusion of his own son Britannicus,
whose death Nero efl'eeted by the hands of
Locusta (S. i. 71), having before been a
party to the murder of his father Claudius,

agreed that, after the tyrant was killed, contrived by his mother Agrippina. All
Piso should also be put out of the way, and this he says was worse than any thing
the empire offered to Seneca, who had been Orestes did. He put his mother Clytemf
