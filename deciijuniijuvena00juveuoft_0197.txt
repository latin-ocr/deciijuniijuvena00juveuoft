SATIRA VI.

Ad moechum veniet lota cute.
Vult formosa domi? moechis foliata parantur;
His emitur quidquid graciles huc mittitis Indi.

Tandem aperit vultum ct tectoria prima reponit :

Incipit agnosci, atque illo lacte fovetur
Propter quod secum comites educit asellas,

Exsul Hyperboreum si dimittatur ad axem.

Sed quae mutatis inducitur atque fovetur

Tot medicaminibus coctaeque siliginis offas

Accipit et madidae, facies dicetur an ulcus?
Est pretium curae penitus cognoscere toto

Quid faciant agitentque die.

Aversus jacuit, periit libraria, ponunt
Cosmetae tunicas, tarde venisse Liburnus
Dicitur et poenas alieni pendere somni
Cogitur: hic frangit ferulas, rubet ille flagello,

Hie scutica: sunt quae tortoribus annua praestent.

464. Ad moechum] [‘Ad moechum lota
Ξὶἒίεηῗῢ cute,’ Jahn, Ribbeck, and most

465. foliata parantur ,·] ‘Foliatum’ was
ointment cxpressed from the leaves of the
‘nardus,' an Indian plaut, the pcrfume got
from which has in all ages been highly es-
teemed. It was of great value, as we know

from the anecdote in the N ew Testament, ,

John xii. 3. 5. Martial says (xi. 27. 9),
“At mea me libram foliati poscat amica ;'’
being among the most costly presents she
could ask. According to Pliny the oil of
the spikcnard was mixed with other oils to
compose ‘ foliatum' (H. N. xiii. 1). Horace
offers his friend virgil an ‘amphora' of
good wine for a small box of ‘ nardum ι’

“ Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum
Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis.'’
(c. iv. 12. 17.)

467. Tandem aperit vultum] She lays
aside her first plasters to anoint her face
with cosmetics of a pleasanter kind, and
batbes herself with asses’ milk, by which,
he says, she set such store, that if she were
sent away to the Hyperborei she would

which was a mystery') according to Pindar
sacrificed asses to Apollo, in which rite
Perseus, the only hero who ever found his
way there, sui-prisea them (Pyth. x. 33.
See note on Hor. C. ii. 20. 16). This may

be the reason why the Hyperboreans arc
mentioned here. Poppaea, in the places of
Pliny and Dio, mentioned above (in v. 462),
is said to have carried about with her 500
asses for their milk to bathe in. The
hiatus after ‘agnosci' is clumsily mended
in some MSS. by adding ‘tunc'after ‘illo.'
Ruperti (V. L. on i. 151) has given all the
instances of hiatus in Juvenal, and they
are not few.

471. Sed quae] [Ribbeck has ‘ Sed quae
fucatis,' &c.]

473. fac-ies dicetur an uleus ?] He
thinks a thing which is always changing
its medicines and being covered with poul-
tices is more like a sore than a woman's face.

474. Est pretium curae] The more com-
mon phrase is ‘ operae pretium ς’ and some
of the MSS. have ‘operae' here and also
in the passage from the Younger Pliny
(Epp. viii. 6) quoted by Forcessini: “Post-
quam mihi visum est pretium curae ipsum
S. C. quaerere.'' He says itis worth while
to inquire how the women employ the-m-
selves by day. And he goes on to show
how if they have a quari-el with their hus-
bands they vent their wrath upon their
slaves. The ‘librariae’ were scribes for
the women, as ‘librarii ' were for the men.
‘ Cosmetae ' were men who attendcd to
their mistresscs' wardrobes and ornaments.
‘ Ponunt tunicas ' means they are stripped
to be flogged. As to Liburnus see iii. 240.

‘Alieni somni' is her husband's slumbers.
