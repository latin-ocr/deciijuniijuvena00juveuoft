Atque alias quarum generosi graminis ipsum

Infecit natura pecus, sed et egregius fons
Viribus occultis et Baeticus adjuvat aer.
Ille nec argentum dubitabat mittere, lances
Parthenio factas, urnae cratera capacem

Et dignum sitiente Pholo vel conjuge Fusci ς

Adde et bascaudas et mille escalia, multum

The wool of Baetica it appears was of a probable that Parthenius here stands for

yellow colour‚ and the colour was popu-
larly attributed to the water of the river.
Martial (xii. 99) adda-esses it thus:

“ Baetis, olivifera crinem redimite corona,
Aurea qui nitidis vellera tingis aquis.”

ῗέἒ) 011 a ‘lacerna Baetica’ he says (xiv.

“Non est lana mihi mendax, nec mutor
aeno ;

Si placeant Tyriae, me mea tinxit
ovis.'’

43. Ille nec argentum dzcbiiabat mit-
†e›·e‚] ‘ Mittere ³ is used in this sense by
Horace (iii. 24. 47) :

“ Vel nos in mare proximum
Gemmas et lapides aurum ct inutile

ᾳ ι ιι ι
muamus, scelerum si bene poenitet.”

The Scholiast says ‘Parthenius' is the name
of a ‘ caelator,' a worker in metal, which he
guessed perhaps from this place. Gran-
gaeus says he was a sculptor “ de quo Pli-
nius plura,³’ which notion Hcinecke (p.
100) is afraid must have come to the old
commentator ‘per portam eburneam? for
he cannot find such a passage in Pliny, nor
can any one else. Ruperti and Heinrich
say ‘ Parthenio’ is equivalent to ‘ Samio,'
‘Parthenia’ being the old name for ‘ Samos‚’
which place was celebrated for its earthen-
ware vessels. (The clay is mentioned in
S. vi. 514.) Juvenal seems to be speaking
throughout of silver. But the Samians
were connected with the earliest history of
metal-casting ς and two Samian artists
named Theodorus are mentioned. It was,
it appears, the younger Theodorus, who
was said by the Delphians (Herod. i. 51) to
have made the great silver ¹ crater ³ given
by Croesus to their temple. This ‘crater ’
Herodotus says held 600 amphorae, about
1800 Roman urnae, or 5400 gallons‚ the
urna being as nearly as possible 3 gallons
(S. vi. 426, n.). This makes it the more

Samius, which reason Heinrich seems to
have overlooked. ‘Crater' was the bowl
in which the ancients mixed their wine
and water (Hor. i. 20. 11, n.). ‘Pho-
lus ' was a centaur whom Virgil among
many others mentions (Georg. ii. 456). He
is generally connected with drinking, as the
centaurs commonly were. VVhoever Fuscus
or his wife may have been, perhaps she is
the woman who sat for the picture in vi.
413—433. She is described as “ totum
Oenophorum sitiens plena quod tenditur
urna.'’ There are two Fusci mentioned,
iv. 112 and xvi. 46.

46. Adde et bascaudas et mille escalia2]
‘ Bascauda ’ is a Celtic word, and originally
belonged to certain vessels introduced from
Britain. The word is the original of ‘ bas-
ket! Martial has an epigram on one (xiv.

“ Barbara de pictis veni bascauda Bri-
tannis :

Sed me nunc mavult dicere Roma
suam.''

The name must have afterwards been given
to silver vessels made elsewhere. ‘ Escalia. '
(vasa) are dishes of whatever shape to
hold meat, ‘esca.’ ‘Lances' were flat.
A large number of MSS. have ‘escalia:’
P. and many others ‘ escaria: which is the
reading of all the editions but Heinrich's,
who compares with ‘ escalia ³ the German
‘ Schale.' ‘Multum caelati’ is ‘a great
quantity of chased silver cups.' As to Philip
and his gold see note on Horace, C. iii.

“ —— diffidit urbium
Portas vir Macedo et subruit aemulos
Reges muneribus.''

Valerius Maximus admires the letter he
wrote to Alexander, chiding him for trying
to win the regard of the people by money,
and asking how he could expect to get by
money that fidelity which could only be
gained by love. Valerius adds, “ At vero
ante Philippus majore ex parte mercator
