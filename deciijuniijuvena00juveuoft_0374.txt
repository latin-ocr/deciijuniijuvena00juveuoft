D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Dum sic ergo habitat Ceti-onius, imminuit rem,
Fregit opes, nee parva tamen mensura relictae
Partis erat ‚- totam hanc turbavit filius amem,

Dum meliore novas attollit marmore villas.

Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbata patrem
Nil praeter nubes et caeli numen adorant,
Nec distare putant humana carne suillam,
Qua pater abstinuit 3 mox et praeputia ponunt.

Romanas autem soliti contemnere leges

J udaieum ediscunt et servant ac metuunt jus,
Tradidit arcano quodeunque volumine Moses;
Non monstrare vias eadem nisi sacra colenti,

tripartite character of the building (xii.
3, n.).

93. F1·e9itopes,] This is the common
verb in this case. We use the same when
we speak of breaking. Horace has “Post-
quam omnis res mea Janum Ad medium
fracta est” (S. ii. 3. 18).

94. turbavitfilius amen.§·,] See vii. 129,
“ Sic Pedo conturbat‚'’ and Forcellini. The
use of ‘ dum ³ with the present followed by
a verb in the perfect tense, which here oc-
curs twice over‚ is common. See i. 59:
“ Qui bona donavit praesepibus—dum per-
volat axe citato,'' and elsewhere. In ix.
3 there is the imperfect.

96. metuentem sabbata patrem] See
notes on vi. 159, 542, and Persius v.
184. He goes on to say that some men
whose fathers were superstitious and paid
respect to the Jewish religion go further
and turn Jews. '‘Metus‚' ‘metuo' are
ordinarily used for religious fear (v. 101).
From the courts of the temple being nn-
covered the Jews were supposed by the
vulgar to worship the skies. Lipsius on
Tacitus, Hist. v. 5, “Judaei mente sola
unumque numen intelligunt,” quotes a
fragment of Petronius about them: “‘et
caeli summas advocat auriculas,' quasi pu-
tarent caelum aures habere idque invoca-
rent.'’ Achaintre, who is the feeblest of
commentators, supposes that Juvenal in
‘ nubes' alludes to the cloud that led the
Israelites through the wilderness He
thinks Juvenal is going out of his way for
an example, because a man may be moral
whatever his religion may be. But J uve-
nal thinks he must be a fool if he turns
J ew, and irreligious too. Pliny calls them
“ gens contumelia numinum insignis '³
(H. N. xiii. 4 sub fin).

98. Nec distare putant] That is, they

abstain from hog's flesh as they would from
man’s. See vi. 160: “Et vetus indulget
senibus clementia porcis.’' Tacitus gives the
Roman explanation of this—“sue abstinent
memoria cladis, qua ipsos scabies quon-
dam turpaverat cui id animal obnoxium ''
(Hist. v. 4). The quadrupeds forbidden ‘to
the Israelites for food were all who did not
chew the eud and were not cloven—footed
(Levit. xi.). The cause of this distinction
is not given and cannot easily be con-
jectured.

99. praeputia ponunt] “ Circumcidere
genitalia instituere ut diversitate noscan-
tur. Transgressi in morem eorum idem
usurpant 3 nec quicquam prius imbuuntur
quam contemnere deos, exuere patriam, pa-
rentes, liberos, fratres vilia habere '³ (Tac.
Hist. v. 5). Tacitus must have known that
many other Eastern nations practised cir-
cumcision, but it was nevertheless true that
this rite was the distinctive symbol of the
J ewish covenant, by which they continued
to be a separate people.

102. Tradidit arcano] This is merely
random talk. There was nothing analogous
in the books of Moses to the ‘arcana' of
the Roman worship, though they were
looked upon as unintelligible and therefore
supposed to have a mysterious meaning
only revealed to the initiated.

103. Non monstrare vias] He says the
law of Moses teaches Jews not to show any
one the way except he be a J ew, nor to tell
the tired traveller where he may quench his
thirst. The Seholiast says on ‘ Quaesitum
ad fonte1n,' “ ubi baptizantur.'’ It is curious
to compare this Scholium with that on v.
102, where Moses is spoken of as “ Sacerdos
vel rex ejus gentis (J udaeorum) aut ipsius
religionis inventor, cujus Cornelius etiam
Tacitus meminit.” These notes are not from
