14. Rarus· sermo illis] Many will be re-
minded of Gratiano's description in the
Merchant of Venice (Act i. sc. 1):

“ There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle likea standingpond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd iu an opinion
Of wisdom, gravsty, profound coneeit ;
As who would say, I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.
Ο my Antonio, Ι (10 know of those
tho therefore only are esteemed wise
For saying nothing‚'’

which is all an expansion of what Solonion
says: ‘¹ Even a fool when he holdeth his
peace 15 counted wise; and he that shut-
teth his lips a man of understanding'’
(Prov. xvii. 28).

15. brec-io>- σωκῶ] Their short-clipped
hair was another ass'eetation of wisdom, fol-
lowing, it is said, the fashion of the 810105.
800 Pers. iii. 54: “ detonsa juventus Invi-
gilat.’' Britannicus quotes in Latin what
he says is a Greek proverb z “nullus coma-
tus qui idem cinoedus non sit.'’ But the
Stoics had a bad name in this matter 3 and
yet Lucian (Hermotimus c. 18, quoted by
Ruperti, and referred to by Turnebus, Adv.
1. xv. c. 17) speaks of them as ἐν χρῷ
κουρίας τοὺς πλείστους, most of them with
their hair clipped down to the skin. Ruperti
has a long note upon ‘ supercilium,’ which
15 not worth attending to.

16. Peribomius :] The Seholiast says he
was au ‘Ars-higallus‚' or chief among the
priests of the Galatian ‘Cybele’ (Hor. S.
i. 2. 121, 0.), but followed an infamous
trade. Ruperti supposes the name to he
taken from βωμός. περιβώμιος 15 used in
the septuag-int translation for a sacred
grove (2 Kings xxiii. 4, and elsewhere).
⁶ Peribomius' is the reading ofM. and many
other MSS. This man made no conceal-
ment of his trade, but shewed it in his gait

and face, and as he was at any rate more
honest, Juvenal lets him alone, aud charges
him (by which he means his wickedness) on
the fates, supposing him to be mad, θεο-
βλαβὴς, as Heinrich says. ‘ Imputare' is
a word used in accounts, for putting to a
person's eredit, as ‘acceptum referre,' or
(as ‘ expensum referre ³) to his debit. To
‘impute ' a thing to any one is to lay it to
his charge. The openuess (‘simplicitas’)
of such persons, and their blind madneSS,
he says may excite compassion and get
them some indulgence. Heinecke justly
reproves Ruperti for substituting ‘quem'
for ‘ qui‚' as if ‘ morbum ' was the object
of ‘ imputo? ‘Morbum’ means his vice,
‘mentis morbum’ as Horace has it (S. ii.
3. 30).

19. qui talia verbis Herculis invadunt]
‘Who attack such vices with big words,
stout, terrible language, such as Hercules
might use.' There is no allusion to the lan-
guage of disdaiu with which Hercules re-
jected the addresses of Pleasurein Prodicus'
story. Ruperti has taken this notion up
from Britannicus, who tells the whole story.
But Heinrich thinks Hercules is mentioned
because the Cynics professed to imitate him
in dress and voice.

21.Se.1·te,] The Scholiast says this was
some senator, which is not improbable.
The name ‘ Varillus ’ is varied in some
MSS. but is so written in most.

22. quo deterior te ?] So Davus addres-
505 his master (Hor. S. ii. 7. 40) ι,

“ Τ11, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior,
ultro
Insectere velut melior verbisque deeoris
Obvolvas vitium Ρ Quid, si me stultior
ipso,'' &e.

23. Loripeclem reclus derideat] ‘Lori-
pes' is the same as ἱμαντόπους. Pliny
(vii. 2) speaks of a tribe among the Indians
who were “ anguium modo loripedes.'' See
