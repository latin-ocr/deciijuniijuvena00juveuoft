A. PERSII FLACCI

Scire, erat in voto 3 damnosa canicula quantum

Raderet 3 angustae collo non fallier orcae ;

Neu quis callidioi· buxum torquere flag-ello.
Haud tibi inexpertum curvos deprendere mores,
Quaeque docet sapiens braccatis illita Medis
Porticus, insomnis quibus et detonsa juventus

Invigilat, siliquis et grandi pasta polenta 3

Et tibi quae Samios diduxit littera ramo
Surgentem dextro monstravit limite callem :
Stertis adhuc, laxumque caput compage soluta
Oscitat hesternum, dissutis undique malis.

Est aliquid quo tendis et in qnod dirigis arcum?

An passim sequeris corvos testaque lutoque
Securus quo pes ferat, atque ex tempore vivis?

pitcher from a distance. The same is
common enough now. The sports here
referred to were not confined to bOyS.
Men whipped tops and trundled hoops,
and taught their children to gamble (J uV.
xiv, 4). After ‘callidior' ‘sit' must be
supplied. ‘ Non fallier ' is ‘not to miss?
[Jahn has ‘ Jure : etenim,’ ἀφ]

52. Haud tibi inexpertum] He means
by this that the youth he is speaking to
is too old for such trissing. He has already
begun to study philosophy, and has learnt
‘¹ curvo dignoscere rectum,” as Horace
says (Epp. ii. 2. 44); and, as Persius says
in the next Satire (v. 11), “rectum dis-
cernis ubi inter Curva subit, vel cum fallit
pede regula varo.'’ In S. v. 38 he has
“Apposita intortos extendit regula mores.”
The ordinary word for ‘ curvos ’ would be
‘pravos' The ‘porticus’ he refers to is
the Stoics' in the Ceramicus at Athens
(“ Chrysippi porticus‚” Hor. S. ii. 3. 44),
in which was a picture of the battle of Ma-
rathon. This is what Persius alludes to.
On this picture he represents the young
Stoics gazing, denying themselves sleep,
and cutting their hair close to their skulls,
and feeding upon beans and barley-cake.
See note 011 Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 123, “vivit
siliquis et pane secundo.'’ Pliny’s descrip-
tion of the way ‘polenta' was made is
given by Forcellini. ‘ Grandi ' only means
that it was coarse thick stuff.

56. quae Samios diduxit littera ramo]
“ The letter which with its branches led the
Samians different ways, and pointed to the
path which rises on the right-hand side.'’
Samos is said to have been the birth-place
of Pythagoras ς the earliest authority being

Isocrates, who calls him Πυθαγόρας ὁ
Σάμιος (Busiris, p. 227, Steph.). To him
tradition attributed the origin of that no-
tion which Prodicus made celebrated by his
fable of the choiee of Hercules. The two
paths to virtue and vice, as well as the
early course of childhood inclining to
neither, Pythagoras is said to have re-
presented by the letter T. It is probable
the story is of very late origin, and derived
from the Latin Y, which suits it better
than the Greek 3 the right hand represent-
ing the narrow path of virtue, and the
other the broad road of vice, as our Saviour
represents them. ‘ Surgentem ’ here means
steep, ‘ arduum ' (see S. v. 34). ‘ Di—
duxit,' as stated by Casaubon, is the true
reading, and not ‘deduxit’ See note on
Hor. C. i. 1. 13, “nunquam dimoveas.’'
The confusion in MSS. between ‘di’ and
‘de' in composition is common. [Jahn
has ‘et tibi quae Samios diduxit litera
ramos.']

58. Stertis adhuc] The connecting words
‘ et tamen ' are omitted (v. 3) : “And yet
you go on snoring to this late hour, nodding
your head as if the hinges were loose,
yawning off ycsterday's ‹lebam-h, with your
jaws at full stretch. Have you an object
or an aim in life (he goes on), οι· are you
here and there, no matter where, pelting
crows and living only for the moment ?”
‘ Ex tempore vivere' is to get our objects
and purposes only from the present mo-
ment. [Here also (see v. 3, n.) Jahn has
a full stop at ‘ callem,' and he consistently
has a note of interrogation after ‘ adhuc,’
and after ‘malis' This matter of pune-
tnation is often a great difficulty]
