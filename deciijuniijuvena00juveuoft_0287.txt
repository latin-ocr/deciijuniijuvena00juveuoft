Principis ’ for ‘ senex Prineeps‚' hus hec-n
noticed before (ix. 65, n.). But the old
emperor was wide awake to the end of his
life. Augustus (Σεβαστὸς) was a title of
all the emperors.

77. ει· quo suffragia nulli] “From the
time they left off selliug votes ;'' that is
since the elections were transferred from
the Comitia to the Senate. See above, viii.
212, n. The subject of ‘effudit curas' is
‘Turba Remi' (v. 73). It means they have
east away all care about public affairs: all
they now care for is their belly aud the
Circus. See note on S. iii. 223 : “Si potes
avelli Circensibus.’' ‘ Panem' is commonly
referred to the public distribution of corn
mentioned in vii. 174, and Lipsius (Elect.
i. 8) takes the word literally, for bread was
substituted for corn some time during the
empire, he thinks by Trajan. 1 think that
Juvenal did not mean to limit his word
thus. The remark applied to all, whether
they were of the sort who wanted the
public dole οι· not. Most MSS. have ‘pau.'
The true word is certainly ‘ panem,' what-
ever eontraction may have been used in
writing it. Ceres was worshipped as Panis.
⁷ 81. Perituros audio multos] One rays
he hears many are to share Sejanus' fate,
and another auswers there is no doubt of
it: there is a great furnace ready (referring
to v. 61). A great many friends of Sejanus,
including his son and daughter, a young
girl, were put to death soon after him
(Dion Cass. 58. 14, 15).

83. ad stlat-lis [υἱέ obvius aram] This
altar of Mars was in the Campus Martius
(Livy xxxv. 10). There is a Brutidius
Niger whom Tacitus (Anu. iii. 66) men-
tions as aedile in ΛΔ). 22, aud as one of
the aecusers of Silanus. He may be the
person the speaker refers to as look-ing a
little pale. Tacitus speaks of him as an
able but ambitious man. “ Brutidium
artibus honestis copiosum, et si rectum iter

pergeret ad clarissima quaeque iturum, fes-
tinatio exstimulabat, dum aequales, dein
superiores, postremo suasmet ipse spes au-
teire parat; quod multos etiam bonos pes-
sum dedit, qui spretis quae tarda eum
securitate praematura vel cmn exitio pro-
peraut.” He wrote some historieal work
from which Seneca quotes two passages on
the death of Cicero (Suasor. vii.). Madvig
(Opuse. i. 44), whom Mr. Mayor follows,
says he was a declamator, and that as the
contest of Ajax aud Ulysses was a common
theme for declamation‚ he had taken
it in his time ; and his friend, as the speaker
in this passage ironieally calls himself, with
derision, says he is afraid Ajax is going to
punish him for his frigid ‘declamatiun-
cula,’ and for not taking his part better.
Madvig says the humorous description of
the trial in vii. 115 sq. is taken from the
same source. This is mere invention. It
does not appear that Niger was a deelaimer.
The passages Seneca quotes are historical,
not declamatory‚ aud there is no other
authority on the subject. Under the eha-
racter of Ajax, enraged with the leaders
and the army for not taking his part against
Ulysses‚ the man means Tiberius, who iu
his letter to the Senate expressed great
alarm, and begged them to send one of the
consuls with a guard to conduct him, a poor
solitary old man, to their presence. Sueto-
nius adds, “ Sic quoque diffidens tumul-
tumque metuens Drusum nepotem quem
vinculis adhue Romae continebat solvi, si
res posceret, ducemque constitui praecepe-
rat '' (c. 65). These apprehensions‚ whe-
ther real or pretended‚ the Senate might
well fear would be visited on them, and
they hastened to remove the cause of them,
and every body connected with him, with au
alaerity which was to make amends for
their implied remissness. This was what
Niger had to sear, and is clearly J uvenal’s
meaning.
