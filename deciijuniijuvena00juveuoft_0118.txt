D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Aut Fabrateriae domus aut Frusinone paratur,

Quanti nune tenebras unum conducis in annum.

Hortulus hic puteusque brevis nec reste movendus
In tenues plantas facili diffunditur haustu.

Vive bidentis amans et culti villicus horti,

Unde epulum possis centum dare Pythagoreis.

Est aliquid, quocunque loco, quocunque recessu,

Unius sese dominum fecisse lacertae.

the rape of the Sabine women, under the
name of Consualia. They consisted of
horse, chan-iot, and foot races, sliam fights,
both land and water, wrestling, boxing. and
fighting with beasts, as well as feats of
horsemanship such as are witnessed 111 1110-
dern circuses. These were performed in the
Circus Maximus the vast building erected,
according 10 tradition, by Tarquinius Pris-
cus between the Aventine and Palatine
hills. similar games and shows were given
from time to time in the Circus by the 0111-
perors and wealthy personS, and at the fes-
tivals of Ceres, Flora, Cybele, &e. There
were four smaller Circi at this time, two
built by Caligula beyond the Tiber, the
Circus Flaminius 011 111111 part of the Cam-
pus Martius which was called Prata Fla-
minia, and the Circus Palatinus, in which
the Ludi Palatini were held. The passion
of the Romans for these exhibitions was
very strong. Juvenal has many allusions
to this: as in vi. 87 he speaks of a woman
eloping and tearing herself away even from
the circus and the theatre 3 in viii. 118, of
the town passing all its time in those amuse-
ments3 111 x. 80, caring for nothing but
bread to eat and the games of the circus3
in xi. 53, that 111011 who run away from
their creditors care only for 0110 thing, that
they lose the games of the eircus; and,
again: “totam hodie Romam circus capit'’
(xi. 197). Pliny the Younger, about the
same time, writes to Calvisius (Epp. ix. 6)
at the time of the Circenses Ludi, with
great contempt of the persons who fre-
quented them, even grave men: “quos
ego quum recordor (says he) in re inani,
frigida, assidua, tam insatiabiliter desidere,
capio aliquam voluptatem quod hac volup-
tate non capiar.'’ Cicero had a dislike to
the Ludi. The ‘venationes' also took
place 111 the amphitheatres (see i. 22. n.)
where the gladiatorial shows were held.
These were not less attractive than the
games of the circus.

optima Sorae Aut Fabrateriae] ‘Pa-
ratur' is opposed to ‘conducis 5³ one is ‘to

buy,' the other ‘to hire.' The three towns
here mentioned were 111 Latium; Sora was
on the Liris, and still retains its name3
part of the walls also are still in existence.
It originally belonged to the Volsci, and
was taken from them and colonized A.U.c.
452. After revolting more than once, it
received a new colony in the time of
Augustus, and appears by this time to
have settled into a quiet place where a
inan might retire and live in peace, and
cheaply. Fabrateria was a town also on
the banks of the Liris, but about twelve
miles lower down, by the junction of that
river and the Trerus. It was on the Via
Latina, and is now said to be represented
by S. Giovanni in Carico. A colony was
sent there by C. Gracchus, and it was called
Fabrateria Nova to distinguish it from an
older colony 111 1110 same territory. Fru-
sino (Frosinone) was situated half—way
between Fabrateria and Ferentinum, also
on the Via Latina, and on the right bank
of the Cosa, a tributary of 1110 Trerus.
Cicero had a farm there.

225. Quanti nunc tenebras] Martia] uses
‘tenebras' 111 the same way for a dark
hovel (ii. 14.): “nee Grylli tenebras
Aeoliamque Lupi.'’

227. facili diffunditur hausta] The ir-
rigation of gardens by means of channels
all connnunicating with one another and
the well which supplied them, is nowhere
so well described as in the Iliad (xxi.
257 sqq.).

228. culti villicus horti,] As to ‘vil-
licus? 500 above, v. 195. Here the man is
his own gardener. As to Pythagoras and
his vegetable diet, see note 011 Ηο1. S. ii.
6. 63, “O quando faba Pythagorae cog-
nata‚” &c.‚ and below, S. xv. 171, sqq.
‘ Bidens' is a sort of hoe (δίκελλα).

231. dominum fecisse lacertam] The
Scholiast draws attention to the circum-
stance that Vix-gil uses ‘lacerti.' Forcellini
supposes ‘ lacerta ’ to be used for a smaller
sort of lizard, and ‘lacertus’ for a larger,
of either sex. The Scholiast adds this
