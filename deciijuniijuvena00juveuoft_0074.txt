1. Ultra Sauromatas] It is enough for
this place to say, that Sarmatia. represented
Poland, and the Rus-sian empire in Europe
and part of Asia, from the Vistula to the
Volga and from the Euxine to the Northern
0001111, including regions nnexplored by the
3110101115, countries of fable, to which, 110-
cording to Pindar (Pyth. x. 40)—

ναυσὶ δ’ οὔτε πεζὸς ἰὼν ἂν εὕροις
———--- θαυματὰν ὁδόν.

See note on Horace, C. ii. 20.16: ‘Hyper-
boreosque campos'

2. aliquid de moribus audent] ‘Audere ’
is here used as we might say, ‘venture any
thing on morals,’ i. e. have the boldness to
say any thing about morals.

3. Qui Curios simulant] ‘Who affect
the Curii.’ On this plural see last Satire‚
v. 109, n. Horace has “ Et maribus Curiis
et decantata Camillis'' (Epp. i. 1. 64),
where, as herc, the person referred to is M.
Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of PyrrhuS,
and the type of 11011051)Υ 111 all after ages
among the Romans; a pattern of the good
old times (see note 011 the above passage of
Horace). Martial (i. 25) 11115 the following
epigram on a lately-marricd 1111111, which,
besides 11115 place, illustrates vv. 8 and 9
(see notes) ι

“Adspicis incomptis illum, Deciane, capillis,
Cujus et ipse times triste supercilium ;
Qui loquitur Curios assertoresque Camil-
los Ρ
Nolito fronti credere ‚- nupsit heri.’'

So 110 says to 0110 Chrestus (ix. 28) ε “Curios
Camillos Quintios Numas Ancos Loque-
ris.'’ ’

fess 11 great. acquaintance with authors 3 but
with all their show you cannot trust their
outsides; within they are full of abomina-

‘ In the first place

tion, and overrun the town with theirlewd-
ness.' ‘ Primum ’ has no ‘ deinde' after it,
and does not require it. It is not 111100111-
inonly used to introduce a subject. Ruperti
makes a ⁵ deinde' at ‘ frontis nulla fides '
(8), 3 ‘praeterea' at ‘hispida membra qui-
dem' (11), and a ‘ denique' at ‘rarus sermo
illis’ (14.) The ‘ frons‚' or outside show, on
which 110 dependence is to be placed, 15 their
affectation of studious habits and learning.

-quanqzcam plena omnia yypso Chry-
sippi] ‘Thongh you will find all parts of
his house full of busts of Chrysippus (the
reputed founder of the Stoic philosophy,
though third in descent from Zeno—see
note on Hor. S. i. 3. 125), made of gypsum,'
of which casts were commonly made. It was
usual to see busts of this sort in librarios,
both public and private—see note on Hor.
S. i. 4. 21 : “Beatus Fannius ultro Delatis
capsis et imagine.”

6. Si quis Aristotelem] ‘Similem’ means
a good likeness. So Martial uses the word
in an epigram on Issa, a little dog of Pub-
lius (i. 110) ε

“ Hanc ne lux rapiat suprema totam
Picta Publius exprimit tabella,
In qua tam similem videbis Issam
Ut sit tam similis sibi nec ipsa.
Issam denique pone cum tabella,
Aut utramque putabis esse veram,
Aut utramque putabis esse pietam.''

7. Et jubet archetypos] Cleanthes was
the teacher of Chrysippus and disciple of
Zeno, and was born at Α55ο5, about the year
B.c. 300. Pittacus, one of the seven wisc
men, was born at Mitylene, about Β.0. 650.
‘ Pluteus' was a shelf fixed to the wall for
books or other things to stand upon. See
Pers. i. 106, 11. The translators say that
Cleanthes' busts are set to guard the books.
It is the shelves that are ordered to hold
the busts. For ‘pluteum' has been substi-
