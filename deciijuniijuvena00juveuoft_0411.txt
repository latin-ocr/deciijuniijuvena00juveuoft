Ρ1115 etenim fati valet hora benigni,

Quam si nos Veneris commendet epistola Marti 5
Et Samia genitrix quae delectatur arena.
Commoda tractemus primum communia, quorum
Haud minimum illud erit, ne te pulsare togatus
Audeat 5 immo etsi pulsetur, dissimulet nec

Audeat excussos Praetori ostendere dentes,

Et nigram in faeie tumidis livoribus offam,
Atque oculum medico nil promittente relietum.
Bardaicus judex datur haee punire volenti

4. fati valet liora beniffni,] This is
Juvenal'sironical style: having mentioned
a lucky star 110 adds, “for of course the mo—
ment of 1151011101,Γ fate is of more avail than
a letter of recommendation to Mars from
Venus or his mother J uno.'' J uno’s wor-
ship at Samos is well known from other
writers and from virgil in particular (Aen.
i. 15: “Quam Juno fertur terris magis
omnibus unam Posthabita coluisse Samo'').
Her temple, the Heraeum, was on the
coast, and it is to the Samiam shore that
‘arena’ refers, not to the saudy character
of the island, as Ruperti says, for it is
generally very fertile.

7. communia,] 'sliat which all soldiers
held 111 common. ‘Togatus ' is the 00111-
mon word for a civilian. ‘ Immo’ here is
affirmative of what precedes, and intro-
duces something more. It is sometimes
used negatively according to the nature of
the sentence: but its common use is to
add some statement, reason, &c., in con-
tinuation and support of what goes before.
Professor Key (L. G. 1429) thinks the
negative use arises from carelessness of
speech. Mr. Long considers the word a
contraction of ‘in modo ' (Cic. in Verr. ii.
1. 1, n., “Immo vero adsit'').

11. tumidis livoribus offam‚] ‘Offa‚’
which is used for a chop or other 111000 of
meat, Juvenal uses twice, each time in a
sense of his own. In S. ii. 33 it. signifies
an abortive birth ; here it means aswelling
from a blow. ‘ Livoribus’ are black con-
tusione. ‘ Medico nil promittente' means
that the doctor cannot warrant that the
man will not lose his eye.

13. Bardaicus judex datur] Among
other things that stink Martia] (iv. 4)
mentions ‘⁶ Lassi bardaicus evocati,” ‘ the
bardaicus of the weary veteram? Some
interpreters say it means a ‘ cucullus,' a
cloak with a covering for the head, other-
wise called ‘ bardocucullus.’ (S. viii. 145,

n.) The meaning may be the same there
as here, but still there may be doubt about
the thing. It is not certain that ‘bar-
daicus' agrees, as many take it, with
‘ calceus' in this place. 1 think it may be
taken independently as 111 Martial. ‘ Cal-
ceus' will in that case be qualified like
‘ surae ’ by ‘ grandes? ‘ Calceus’ was the
general name for a walking shoe or boot
as opposed to others worn in the house,
or sandals which only covered the sole
or were strappcd on to the upper part of
the foot. Of the latter sort were ‘ caligae’
(24) which were heavy sandals with nails
worn by the common soldiers as the ‘cal-
ceus’ was worn by the officers, though
sometimes the officers wore ‘caligae' (Lips.
on Tac. Ann. i. 41). See iii. 247, n.

planta mox undique magna
calcor et in digito clavus mihi militis hae-
rct.''

 

The form ‘bardaicus' is not certain. Some
MSS. have ‘ bardiacus ' which seems more
suited to the metre. I doubt whether the
second syllable of ‘ bardaicus ' according to
its received etymology can be shortened.
For this reason the reading ‘Archaicis' has
been properly rejected in Horace, Epp. i.
5. 1, “ Si potes Archiacis conviva recum·
bere lectis.'’ The name is said to be de-
rived from the Bar-daei, an Illyrian peo-
ple. from whom this sort of military shoe
was taken, as it is said.

Juvenal says (according to the above) if
a man wishes to punish the soldier who has
maltreated him, the judex assigned to him
is a ‘ bardaicus,' a great boot, and a pair of
thick calves under a big bench: that is, he
must carry his case into the camp, and if
he is allowed a trial it will be a. court-mar-
tial with a centurion for judex. ‘J udicem
dare ' was properly said of the praetor who
could appoint if he pleased a judex privatus
to hear a private case at the instance of the
