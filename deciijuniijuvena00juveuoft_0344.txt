D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Jacturae te mergat onus, nec rara videmus

Quae pateris.

Casus multis hic cognitus ac jam
Tritus et e medio fortunae ductus accrvO.

10

Ponamus nimios gemitus3 flagrantior aequo

Non debet dolor esse viri nec vulnere major.

Tu quamvis levium minimam exiguamque malorum
Particulam vix ferre poteS, spumantibus ardens

Visceribus sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus

15

Depositum? stupet haee qui jam post terga reliquit
Sexaginta annos, Fonteio Consule natus?

An nihil in melius tot rerum proficis usu?

lNIagna quidem, sacris quae dat praecepta libellis,

Victrix fortunae sapientia: ducimus autem

8. Jaeturae te mergat emm] This is
lather a confusion of metaphors. J ‘lctui a’
is that which is thrown over to lighten a
ship (iii. 125, n..) Here as in other pl 1665
it means 31055,311(1 he sa3 5 1115 friend’ 5 for-
tune' 15 not so small that the burden of a
moderate loss should sink him.

10. Tritus et e medio] He means his
mis fortune' 15 3 common one, and taken at
random out of the heap of ordinary 3661-
dents.

13. Tu ‘quamtis levium] ‘Be they as light
as you w ill.’ This 15 the primary meaning
of‘ quamv 15,’ 35 any one may see. Mr.
Long has a note on‘ ‘quamvis set te et pa-
tronos tuos ingeniosos esse dicito'' (Cic. in
Verr. ii. 3. 16), w·‘he1e quamvis' belongs
to ‘ingeniosos ;’ “call yonrself and your
supporters as elever as you please.’' Zumpt
too 1135 3 note there saying that ‘ quamvis ’
is put for ‘quantumvis‚’ which Mr. Long
denies. Ι mention this lest Heinrich's note
should mislead. He refers to S. viii. 15.
“ Euganea quantumvis mollior agna,” which
is different, as may be readily seen. Caesar
says of the Suevi, ‘³ ad quemvis numerum
ephippiatorum equitum quamvis pauci adire
audent? “any number you please of ca-
valry that ride in saddles, be they as few as
you please, they are bold to attack '³ (B. G.
iv. 6. 3).

14. spumantibus ardens Visceribus] Se-
neca gives it as one of the effects of violent
anger “ exaestuante ab imis praecordiis san-
guine'' (de Ira i. 1).

16. Depositum Ζ] The law respecting
‘deposita’ is given in Diet. Ant„ Mr. Long's
article ‘ Depositum.² If the person receiv-
ing the deposit was guilty of fraud he in-
curred ‘ infamia?

17. Fonteio Consule natus. ²] L. Fon-
teius Capito was consul with C. Vipsanius
A. D. 59, and there is eveiy reason to sup-
pose this' 15 the y=e ιι· J 11161131 alludes to. If
so, and it 1135 sixty ,16315 at least before,
this satire could not have been written be·
fore ΑΛ). 119, which was the second year of
Hadrian’s reign. There was a Fonteius
consul in Tiberius’ reign, ΑΔ). 12. If he
be the person named here the satire was
written in the third or fourth year of Ves-
pasian. But that is not probable. There
was a consul of the same name A.D. 67.
Lipsius (Epist. Quaest. iv. 20) and other
scholars prefer the second. (See Introduc-
tory Memoir.)

18. tot rerum proficis usu ἲ] Cicero says
of Cato (de Amicit. c. 2) that he was 36-
counted wise “ quia multarum rerum usum
habebat,” he had a large experience of the
world, of life and its affairs, · and that is the
meaning here. The man had lived long
enough0 to get experience of men and things,
and 3et 116 113(1 profited by it so little as to
be surpi ised at being cheated. Jahn from
the Scholiast has‘ proficit usus '[and Rib-
beck] All the MSS. have ‘ usu.² P. and
a few others have ‘proficit‚' which Her-
mann has with ‘usu.’ In the same line
the MSS. vary between ‘an,’ ‘ae-,³ ‘ad‚’
‘at' (which two last are meant for the
same word), and ‘ a.’ M. has ‘ at!

20. T'ietrix fortunae sapientia .·]
pientia' is philosophy. See note on Hor.
C. i. 34: “ Insanientis dum sapientiae
Consultus erro.'' ⁶ J actare jugum' is the
opposite of ‘ferre jugum’ (vi. 208. Hor.
C. i. 35 : “ Ferre jugum pariter do->
losi ³²).
