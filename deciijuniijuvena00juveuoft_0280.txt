230 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 246. Nestor of course was happy, who lived to be as old almost as the crows.
But see him mourning byAntiloehus’ pyre, asking what crime he had done that 110 should
live so long. See Peleus weeping for Achilles, see Laertes mourning for his wandering
son. Had l’riam died before the war of Troy, his sons had carried him to burial with
solemn rites and mourning women, his daughters at their head. What did he get by
living? He saw all Asia fall by fire and sword, then put his armour on and ran to the
altar like an old ox to perish. His death however was a man's ε 1115 wife survived him
and she died a dog. But passing Pontus' king and Croesus and the lesson Solon gave
him, look at Marius, exiled, imprisoned, swamped, and begging broad where he was late
a victor. tho had been happier had he breathed his last when he came down from
his triumphal chariot Ρ Pompeius had a fever sent him, but the prayers of many towns
prevailed, and so his fortune saved him to lose an army and 1115 head. This Lentulus
was spared, Cethegus too died whole, and Catilina fell no mangled carcass.

V. 289. Mothers will pray for beauty for their children. thy should they not?
Lucretia bids 115 ask not for form like hers : Virginia would have changed with the

· hunehbaek girl. The parents of a handsome boy must always tremble, so seldom
ehastity and beauty go together: though he be trained with all simplicity‚ though
nature guard him with a modest mind and blushing face, they will not suffer him to
grow a man z lust will spare nothing, e'en to bribe his parents. The plain are never

· ravished. Then be not proud of your boy's looks. So much the greater dangers wait “
for him. A common paramour he’ll soon become, with all the risks from jealous hus-
hands who don't spare their rivals. First your boy shall play the lover with a dame he
likes; but soon a richer, whom he likes not, shall seduee him and strip herself of all
she has to give him. “ But if he’s chaste his beauty will not hurt ffimss’ Nay, did
Hippolytus’ virtue profit him, or did Bellerophon's P Rejeetion stung those women
to revenge. lVoman is then most savage when shame goads on revenge.

V. 329. How would you counsel Silius, when Messalina had resolved to marry him?
The best and handsomest, a noble youth, is ravished to his death by the Empress' eyes.
The veil is on her head, the bed prepared, the portion settled, and the auspices
declax-ed. Is it a private business Ρ No, she must marry as becomes her state. Now
make your ehoiee, marry or die before the evening falls3 marry and die when the
Prince hears of it. You’ll have afew days' interval, he'll be the last to learn his own
disgrace : so do her bidding. Either way thy fair neck suffers for it.

V. 346. Must we then ask for nothing Ρ Leave the gods themselves to settle whatis good
for us. They give us what is best, not pleasantest. We ask in the heat of passion for
wife or children, and know not what they'll prove. But if you must pray, let it be for
health, a healthy body and a healthy mind 3 stout beart that fears not death, but counts
the end of life a gift of nature 3 able to bear its toilS, patient, content, preferring Her-
eules' labours to lust and appetite and luxury. This you may give yonrself; a tranquil
life lies in the path of virtue. You want no god with Prudence at your side: 'tis we,
'tis we, make thee a goddess, For-tune, and set thee up in heaven.

Vera bona atque illis multum diversa, remota
Erroris nebula. Quid enim ratione timemus
