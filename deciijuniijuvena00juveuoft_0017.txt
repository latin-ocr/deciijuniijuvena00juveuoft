Ῑ have not thought it right to omit any part of these Satires.
The character of the writers is seen throughout, and the spirit even
of the coarsest parts is nianifestly that of virtue. I have had some
experience of boys and I believe that those are exceptions on
whom such passages as are usually expunged arc likely to have an
injurious effect. WVantonness is one thing, and the stern reproof
of wantonness in ternis it best under-stands is another, and few
minds fail to see the difference. I have thought it enough to pass
over the worst passages without comment.

He who is occupied with the labours of two professions‚ the cares
of a large family, and the unavoidable distractions of a town life,
may claim some indulgence for the defects of a work requiring much
attention and a clear judgment at every point, and for the execution
of which only a limited. time could be allowed. Ι have done
the best I could under the circumstances for students and general
readers of Juvenal and Persius, that they may be able to understand
and take an interest in those writers, especially the former, who has
great charms for all that can appreciate a vigorous mind and Stoical
integrity. In this task I am thankful to have had the advice and
sympathy of my friend, Mr. George Long.
