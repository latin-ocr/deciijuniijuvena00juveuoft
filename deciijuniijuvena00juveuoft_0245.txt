Non quae ventoso eonducta sub aggere texit.

him a good character. thcn people were
speculating upon a successor to Nero, Ru-
bellius was fixed upon. Tacitus says :
“Omnium ore Rubellius Plautus celebratur,
cui nobilitas per matrem ex J ulia familia.
Ipse placita majorum colebat, habitu sc-
11010, casta et secreta domo, quantoque
metu occultior tauto plus famae adeptus ''
(Ann. xiv. 22). When hc was urged by
his friends to resist the sentence of death
and raise a rebellion he refused ; perhaps,
Tacitus thinks (ib. 59), through affection
for his wife and children, who hc thought
would meet with more mercy if he sub-
mitted quietly. Juvenal makes use of his
name probably without thinking much
about accuracy, and though the inan had
been dead some years he speaks of him as
still alive (v. 46). But he means 111 fact
any body. As to ‘ stemmate ' sce note on
v. 1. Nearly all the MSS. have ‘ Blande'
instead of ‘ Plautc.’ Plautus was the son
of Blandus, who was the husband of J ulia.
Ee cannot therefore be the person here
meant. Lipsius (on Tac. xiii. 19) shows
that sons did not take their fathers'
names, and that the son of Blandus was
Plautus. Mr. Mayor says it is a son of
Plautus, “who appears to have assumed
his grandfather’s cognomen (as was usual),
and in Juvenal's time to have been noto-
rious for his pride of birth.’' To get rid
of the difficulty in v. 42, he says “ Rubel-
lius Plautus the father is here confounded
with his son ;'' which is not very likely if
the son was a contemporary of Juvenal.
There is a variant ‘Plance‚’ which is a
combination apparently of the two other
names. M. has ‘Planee,' with ‘ Blande' in
the margin.

42. Ut te conciperet] Heinrich conjec-
tures with great probability that Juvenal
wrote ‘ et? ‘ Ut' is out of place here 3 but
the MSS. and editions do not vary. He
says the man is as proud as if he had done

something to (leserve nohility‚ and to be
born of a noble mother rather than of a
poor woman working sor daily pay at the
loom by the ‘agger ' of Tullius, respecting
which see note on S. v. 153. ‘ Ut ' must
mean ‘so that‚’ if it bc genuine.

46. Ast eqo Cecropides !] εὐγένεια Κέ-
κροπος was a proverb. The man means hc
is of royal blood, that is all.

49. Nobilis indocti ;] ‘ Nobilis ’ is not
used as a substantive, and ‘ indocti' does
not agree with it as an adjective with a.
noun. It is, ‘the nobleman who is uu-
1earned‚’ as ‘jam veteres caecos' in vii. 170
is ‘ blind men who are quite old,’ and ‘ 111-
sipiens fortunatus' (Cic. Lael. c. 15) is
‘a fool if he be fortunate? (See below,
ix. 16, 11.) Mr. Mayor is mistaken 11010.
‘Quiritem ’ is emphatic ; he is not only a
man but a Roman citizen, and worthy of
being so. Horace says (C. ii. 7. 3) to his
friend Pompeius z

“ Quis te redonavit Quiritem
Dis patriis Italoque caelo ? '³

As to ‘plebe togata' see S. i. 96. Τ110
poorer sort of people *may have been so
called by the rich from their frequent ap-
pearance before thern in the ‘ toga,' without
which it was not respectful to go into the
presence of their patrons. But Heinrich
prefers reading ‘togatus’ in the sense of
‘ advocatus‚’ quoting Cicero (De Or. i. 24.) :
“ Unus e togatorum numero atque ex fo-

rensi usu homo mediocris.”

50. Qui juris nodos] More has been
put upon these words thau they will bear.
‘ Solvere’ is supposed to allude to a name
(λύται) which was given, it appears, later to
students of law. The meaning is quite clear
and the language common. [As to ‘jus'
sce S. ii. 72, n.]

51. Hie petit Euphraten] He says this
plebeian goes to the wars like a good sol-
dier, while the Cecropides stays at homo
