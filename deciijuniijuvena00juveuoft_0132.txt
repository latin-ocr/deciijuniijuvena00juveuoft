D. JUNII JUVENALIS

narrate, puellae 35

Pierides: prosit mihi vos dixisse puellas.

Quum jam semianimum laceraret Flavius orbem

Muses (as Horace does when he is going to
tell the squabble between the parasites,
S. i. 5. 53), but he says this is not matter
for a song, that is, for fiction and ornament,
but a grave matter of fact on which they
should sit and deliberate.

“ Begin, Calliope, let's sit, but sing
ive may not3 this is truth, 110 fained
thing? (Stapylton.)

Why the Muses were called Pierides the
reader will learn by referring to Miiller's
Hist. of Greek Lit. p. 27, or to Hor. A. P.
405, n. Juvenal claims credit for calling
them ‘puellae,' which word was only used
for chaste young women, single or married.

37. Quum jam semianimum] The full
name of Domitian was T. Flavius Domitia-
nus Caesar Augustus. He was the third
Flavius. His brother and his father were
both T. Flavius Sabinus Vespasianus. His
mother was Flavia Domitilla. The Flavia
gens were plebeian, and of Sabine origin, in
which country the emperor Vespasian was
born. Though Domitian was the last em-
peror who had borne the gentiliciam name
of Flavius when this satire was written, all
the Constantines were Flavii.

38. calvo serviret Roma Neroni‚] Ju-
venal calls Domitian a bald Nero, meaning
that he was as bad as that tyrant. Sue-
tonius (e. 18) relates that he was hald,
round-bellied‚ and thin 111 the legs, though
in his youth he was a good-looking man,
except that he had clubbed feet (‘ digitos
restrictiores habebat ') ε he was tall, with a
modest countenance, high colour, and large
but rather dull eyes. Suetonius says he
was very sensitive about his baldness, but
nevertheless he wrote a treatise on the pre-
servation of the hair, addressed to a friend
who was bald like himself. He quoted for
his friend's consolation and his own (says
Suetonius) a verse of Homer:

οὐχ ὁράᾳς οἶος κάγὼ καλός τε μέγας τες
(Ι1. xxi. 108,)

and adds, “ Eadem me tamen manent capil-
lorum fata, et forti animo fero comam 111
juventa senescentem. Scias nee gratius

quidquam decore nee brevius.” Ausonius
near three centuries later (De XII Caesari-
bus per Suetonium Tranquillum scriptis)
copies J uvenal's expression, and thus men-
tions the three Flavii:

“ His decimus fatoque accitus Vespasianus :
Et Titus imperii felix brevitate ; secutus
Frater, quem calvum dixit sua Roma

Neroncm.’'

If the name became common as he implies,
it was probably through this Satire.

39. spatium admirabile rhombi‚] This
is like the way of speaking below, ‘ Crispi
jucunda senectus' (v. 81) 3 and ‘ sententia
dia Catonis‚' Hor. S. i. 2. 32, and other like
phrases in that writer. (See note on C. 1.
3. 36.) The ‘ rhombus' is usually supposed
to have been a turbot; but it is uncertain.
It was a flat fish. The finest were caught
near Ravenna, on the Adriatic.

40. quam Dorica sustinet Ant-om] An-
cona was a flourishing town of Picenum
on the coast of the Adriatic, and near the
Cumerian promontory, the northern ex-
tremity of the curve which the coast makes
here. It was founded by some refugees
from Syracuse in the time of the elder
Dionysius, about B. c. 380, for which
reason Juvenal calls it Dorian. ‘Catullus
mentions Ancon as one of the resorts of
Venus (xxxvi. 13). There are no traces of
the temple, but a late writer thinks that
“in all probability it occupied the same
site as the modern cathedral, on the sum-
mit of the lofty hill that surrounds the
whole city and constitutes the remarkable
headland from which it derives its name’'
(Dict. Geog.). ‘ Sustinet,' ‘holds up‚’ may
mean that the temple was ou a hill. The
priucipal remains now extant are the mole
constructcd by Trajan not long after this
Satire was written, and a triumphal marble
arch erected upon it 111 honour of that
emperor. The coins of the city, of which
many exist, bear the Greek name ΑΓΚΩΝ
upon them. The later poets used that
form as well as Ancona, which is the
modern name also.
