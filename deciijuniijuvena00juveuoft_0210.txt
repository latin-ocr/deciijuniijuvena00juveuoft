Grandia monstra suis audebant temporibus, sed

Non propter nummos.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

645

'Minor admiratio summis

Debetur monstris, quoties facit ira nocentem
Hune sexum ε rabie jecur incendente f'eruntur
Praecipites, ut saxa jug-is abrupta, quibus mons

Subtrahitur clivoque latus pendente recedit.

650

Illam ego non tulerim, quae computat et scelus ingens
Sana facit. Spectant subeuntem fata mariti

Alcestim et, similis si permutatio detur,

Morte viri cupiant anima-m servare catellae.

Occurrent multae tibi Belides atque Eriphylae

655

hIane 3 Clytaemnestram nullus non vicus habebit.
Hoc tantum refert, quod Tyndaris illa bipennem
Insulsam et fatuam dextra laevaque tenebat :

At nunc res agitur tenui pulmone rubetae ε

Sed tamen et ferro, si praegustabit Atrides

650

Pontica ter victi cautus medicamina regis.

at these monsters who out-top the rest,
for they were hurried on by the passions of
their sex. But that woman is intolerable
who makes murder a matter of gain and
calculation (quae computat).

647. Debetur monstrisj [Ribbeck points
this verse and the following thus z

‘ quoties facit ira nocentes.
Hunc sexum rabie jecur &c.,’

which is not an improvement.]

649. quibus mons Subtrahitur] This
describes a landslip3 “like stones torn
from the heights from which a mountain is
withdrawn‚ and from the hanging slope its
side recedes.”

652. Spectant subeuntem] They go to
the play and see Alcestis dying for Ad-
metus, and if such things might be, they
would gladly send their husbands to the
grave to save the life of a lapdog.

655. Belides arque Eriphylae] The
daughters of Danaus, son of Belus, king of
Argos, who murdered their husbands, aud
Eriphyle, the wife of Amphiaraus, who in-
duced her husband to take part in the
expedition against Thebes, in which he lost
his life, and her son Alcmaeon to join the
second expedition of the Epigoni, in the
hope of his doing the same. But he sur-
vived to kill her. Her price in the first
case was a necklace, in the second a gown.
‘ Manc' means in the early part of the
morning, when comparatively few women
are abroad. Ruperti compares v. 601

“ nunquam tibi mane videndus,” but that
has nothing to do with the sense here.

657. Hoc tantum refert,] ‘ There is
only this difference.' ‘Quid refert ἴθ’ ‘ what
difference is it? ’ ‘ Non minimum refert,'
‘ it makes a great difference.' “ N ec minimo
sane discrimine refert” (S. v.123) is another
construction. ‘ Refert ’ being au abbrevia-
tion of ‘ rem fert' is capable of a different
construction, ‘ mea refert,' ‘itis for my in-
terest.' The differ-enee here is that Cly-
temnestra killed Agamemnon with a rude
uncouth axe that she could only lift with
both hands, while now-a-days women go to
work with secret poison, such as the inside
of a toad (ι rubeta‚' S. i. 70). But they
would seize the hatchet if their Agamem-⁷
nons were in the habit of taking antidotes
such as Mithridates V1.,king of Pontus,
took. (See note on xiv. 252.) The three
principal persons by whom his armies were
defeated were Sulla, who destroyed his
forces in Greece, B.C. 87 -84, and made
peace with him; Lucullus, who, when hos·
tilities were renewed‚ drove him from his
own country, Ro. 72‚whieh, however, he re-
covered, but was driven from it again by Cn.
Pompeius (B.c. 66), who reduced Pontus
to the condition of a Roman province. He
died three years afterwards in the Crimea‚
by the sword of a Gaul whom he asked to
kill him. See Cic. de Leg. Agraria, ii. c.
19, Long's note, vol. ii.

660. Sed tamen] [In this verse Ribbeck
has ‘ praegustarit.']
