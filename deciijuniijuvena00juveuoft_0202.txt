D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ergo hic praecipuum summumque meretur honorem,
Qui grege linigero circumdatus et grege calvo
Plangentis populi currit derisor Anubis.

Ille petit veniam, quoties non abstinet uxor

Concubitu sacris observandisque diebus,
lllagnaque debetur violato poena cadurco,

Et movisse caput visa est argentea serpens :
Illius lacrimae meditataque murmura praestant

Ut veniam culpae non abnuat ansere magno

540

Scilicet et tenui popano corruptus Osiris.

Quum dedit ille locum, cophino foenoque relicto
Arcanam J udaea tremens mendicat in aurem,
Interpres legum Solymarum et magna sacerdos

Arboris ac summi fida internuntia caeli 3

545

Implet et illa manum, sed parcius: aere minuto

Qualiacunque voles Judaei somnia vendunt.
Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi

Testamentum ingens calidae pulmone columbae

means the priest—“ a noble heart and mind
for the gods to hold communion with at
night Σ ” ‘ Ergo ' is also indignant. ‘⁴ So
this is he who claims the first aud highest
honour? ” ‘ Linigero ’ refers to their
lineu dresses. Her priests, and sometimes
it appears her worshippers, wore linen.
Tibullus speaks of his Delia sitting before
her temple ‘lino tecta' (i. 3. 30). That
the priests were also ,shorn we learn from
Plutarch’s treatise on Isis and Osiris, and
Herodotus says so of the Egyptians gene-
rally. Martial speaks of the priests as
‘ linigeri, calvi, sistrataque turba? Some
MSS. have ‘ lanigeri? (See Heius. on Ov.
Ars Am. i. 77.)

534. Planyentis populi] The worship of
Anubis, another Egyptian god, was intro-
duced at Rome probably at the same time
and in conjunction with that of [sis. Plu-
tarch (Is. et Os. 38) speaks of Anubis as
the guard of sts. His symbol was a dog’s
head, which was carried by the priests of
Isis about the city (S. xv. 8, “oppida tota
canem venerantur '') ; and Juvenal says he
laughed at the crowd beating their breasts
as he passed.

535. Ille petit veniam,] ‘Ille' means
the priest who carried the god, who being
applied to by this or that woman to get her
offence pardoned, entreats Osiris for her.
His practised tears and sighs prevail (‘ me-
ditata ³ belongs to both) as appears by the

asp which the god carried in his hand
moving its head, a pieee of jugglery easily
performed. Heinsius, on Ovid (Met. ix.
693: “Plenaque somniferi serpens pere·
grina veneni '') quotes this description of
Isis from Apuleius: “ Laeva cymbium de-
pendebat aureum, cujus ansulae, qua parte
conspicua est, insurgebat aspis, caput at-
tollens arduum.” Heinrich refers to a medal
of Memphis representing the god with an
asp in his left hand. As to ‘ cadurco? see
S. vii. 221. The notiori that men and
women were bound to keep themselves
chaste during the festival of Isis is referred
to in various places by the poets. See Ru-
perti’s note. Osiris, the Nile-god and hus-
band of Isis, was worshipped in conjunction
with his wife (viii. 29). Horace makes
his man with a broken leg swear “per
sanctum Osirim '³ (Epp. i. 17. 60). Hc is
bribed by a goose, the usual offering to
Isis (often found on Egyptian monuments),
and a ‘popanum,' which was a flat thiu
cake commonly used in sacrifices. Ti-
maeus (Lex. Plat.) describes πόπανα as
πέμματα πλατέα καὶ λεπτὰ καὶ περιφερῆ,
on which Ruhnken has a note which may
be eonsulted, and casaubon on Athenaeus,
iv. 21.

542. cophino foenoque relic-to] These
have been mentioued before, S. iii. 14.
‘ Cophinus ' is the word used by the sacred
writers for baskets in the accounts given
