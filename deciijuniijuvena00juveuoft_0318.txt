D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Functus ad has epulas solito maturius ibat,
Erectum domito referens a monte ligonem.

Quum tremerent autem Fabios durumque Catonem

Et Scauros et Fabricios, postremo severos
Censoris mores etiam collega timeret,
Nemo inter curas et seria duxit habendum,
Qualis in Oceani fluctu testudo nataret,

Clarum Trojugenis factura ac nobile fulcrum ;

Sed nudo latere et parvis frons aerea lectis
Vile coronati caput ostendebat aselli,

Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.
Tales ergo cibi qualis domus atque supellex.

90. Quum tremerent autem] In the good
days when men were afraid of the censors.
Of the Fabii (ii. 1463 vi. 14, 191) there
were many censors. M. Porcius Cato is
the elder of that name, who was censor
Rc. 184. M.Aemilius Scaurus (S. ii. 35, n.)
was censor B.c. 109, and C. Fabricius Lus-
cinus B.C. 275 (ix. 142). The story referred
to 111 92 15 told by Valerius Maximus (ii. 9.
6, “de Censoria Severitate ’'). Claudius
Nero and Livius Salinator were colleagues
in the censorship B.c. 204. They were both
‘equites‚' and each had a public horse.
Livius had been condemned by the people
in his first consulship fifteen years before.
During 1115 censorsliip‚ when the names of
his century were called over, the crier hesi-
tated whether 110 should call that of Sa-
linator, but Claudius obliged him to do
so, and ordered his colleague to 5011 1115
horse as one who had been condemned by
the people. Salinator retaliated. Livy tells
the sanie story, xxix. 37. The Scholiast
tells another of the same sort of Fabius
and Decius (Livy x. 24), but- Juvenal has
spoken already of the Fabii, and the accu-
racy of that story rests only on t-he autho-
rity of the Scholiast. Livy says these col-
leagues were very harmonious. Juvenal
also appears to me to have had Valerius'
chapter in his mind throughout, and he
twice refers to Claudius and Livius 111 eon-
nexion with their severe censorship, [Rib-
beck omits vv. 91, 92. Ps, Jahn, and
Ribbeck have Oceano, v. 94.]

95. Clarum Trojzckqenis] See i. 100:
“ Ipsos Troiugenas ;'' and vi. 80 : “ testu-
dineo tibi, Lentule, conopeo :³⁵ and vi. 22 :
·‘ Genium contemnere fulcri.'’ The legs
of the beds and dinner 001101105, as well as
the sides, were sometimes highly orna·

mented. In the old times, he says, men
were content with a small couch, with
plain sides and a bronze ornament in front
representing a rude ass's head crowned
with vine leaves. The ass was sacred
to Bacchus. The home-bred slaves (ver-
nae), whom he means by ‘ruris alumni?
made game of the rude figure. The con-
struction in v. 96 is ⁶ sed (in) lectis nudo
latere et parvis frons aerea ostendebat,’
‘ on couches with bare sides and small, a
front of bronze displayed the rude head of
an ass with a wreath.' Herminius conjec-
tured ‘vite’ for ‘vile.' But it is not
wanted. Ruperti would rather have ‘co-
ronatis,' meaning the guests, which must
be expressed to be intelligible. The text
wants no alteration. Gifford has a long
note on asses. He read ‘ vite?

99. Tales eryo eibi] Heinrich and Jahn
reject this verse [aud RibbeckJ. Ι 500 110
reason to do so. The main subject is the
food: there has been a digression upon
the furniture, and he comes back to the
food, which is a common use of ‘ergo ' (S.
x. 54, n.). If Juvenal had in his mind the
passage of Valerius quoted on v. 77, he
would have remembered “quales epulas
apparatus indicio est‚’' which is like what
he says here.

100. Tunc rudis et Graias] The allusion
here is chiefly to the destruction of Corinth
by Mummius (13.c. 146). The historians
describe the waste and destruction of va-
luable works of art as most deplorable.
Florus (ii. 16) says the city was first
sacked‚ and then, at the sound of a trum-
pct, burnt. He adds, “Quid signorum,
quid vestium quidve tabularum raptum,
incensum atque projectum ‹ffb->incendio
permistis plurimis statuis atque simulacris,
