(c. 74). Various snmptuary laws regulating
the expense of dining are given by Gellius,
ii. 2>l=3 but the Romans never paid much
attention to them. See Diet. Ant. ‘ Sump-
tuariae leges! Here were men, according
to Juvenal, who at their private dinner
tables had seven. The accusative, ‘fercula’
15 like Horace's “patinas coenavit omasi
Vilis et agninae.'’

95. Nune sportula primo Limine parva
sedet] He says that the ‘ sportula ³ is now
a shabby affair, and that instead of being
given in the ‘atrium ’ as a regular enter-
tainment (‘ coena reeta ³) in the way clients
used to be received by their patrous, it was
now set out at the door, to be scrambled
for by thchungry rabble, closely watched by
the master, 10511111)ν should get it under false
pretences. ‘ Sportula‚' a little basket‚ was
1110 name given to a dole which first under
the emperors it became customary for rich
men to give to those dependents who chose
to pay their respects to them at their early
reception in the morning, and to danee at-
tendanee upon them at other times. It was
given sometimes in the shape of meat, at
others in a small 511111 of money, usually
]00 quadrantes, or one and a half denarii,
about elcven pence (v. 120, and v. 127 note).
Gifl'ord has confounded the public ‘ sportula?
with the private. The former, not the lat-
ter, was established by Nero and abolished
by Domitian.

96. turbae rapienda togatae] Ruperti
says this is spoken contemptuously, because
under the emperors only the poorer and
vulgar sort wore the ‘toga.' This is non-
scnse. He refers to Horace, S. i. 2. 63. 82,
which only shows that women of bad cha-
racter wore a ‘ toga ³ instead of a ‘ stola.’
The ‘ toga ' was worn out of respect to the
great man, and it was counted bad taste for
any person of respectability to go abroad
without it. At one time it became common
for persons of family to go to the theatre
without the ‘ toga,' and Augustus put a stop
to the practice. ‘ Turba togata,' ‘ gens to-

gata‚' were commonly used for the Romans.

97. trepidat,] This word expresses any
hurried aetion or eniotion. ‘Inspicit et
trepidat’ means he looks in the man's
face anxionsly, with a sharp scrutinizing
eye. ‘ Ille ' can hardly be any but the
master, who is supposed to condescend so
far as to look on and regulate the distribu-
tion. Some take it for the ‘ dispensator’ or
‘ balneator-,⁵ which is the name Martial
gives to the servant who distributed the
‘ sportulae? “ Quos (quadrantes) dividebat
balneator elixus ’³ (iii. 7. 3).

99.jubet a praecone vocari Ipsos Troja-
yenas 5] The ‘ praeco ' may mean the ⁴ no-
menclator‚' whose particular duty was to
attend the morning visits and to know all
his master’s acquaintance by sight- and
name, with their circumstances and all
about them. See Hor. Epp. i. 6. 50, 11.
The master bids this man call up the re-
spectable people first ; for, says Juvenal,
proud gentlemen of the old families eon-
descend to join us hnmble folk in begging.
The poorer they got the more they stuek to
their pedigree, and nothing would satisfy
them short of the blood of Aeneas ,111111011-
veins. See below (viii. 42), “Ut te eon-
ciperet quae sanguine fulget Iuli ;'' (ib. 56)
“ Dic mihi, Teucrorum proles ; '’ (ib. 181)
“ At vos, Trojugenae ;’' (xi. 95) “ Clarum
Trojugenis factura ac nobile fulcrum? See
also Horace, S. ii. 5. 63, n.: “Ab alto de-
missum genus Aenea.''

101. Da Praetori, da deinde Tribuna]
See S. iii. 128. Martial has an epigram
addressed to Paulus, a senator, beginning

“Cum tu laurigeris annum qui fascibus
intras

Mane salutator limina mille teras ἶ 10)

where ‘limina terere' corresponds to ‘ vex-
ant limen’ in the last line. Horace (S. i.
8.18) says of the Esquiline, thieves and
beasts were wont ‘hunc vexare loeum,' to
infest it. It must be supposed that some-
