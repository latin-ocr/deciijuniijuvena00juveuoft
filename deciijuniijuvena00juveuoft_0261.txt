Pras-litui Graiaeque apium meruisse coronae.
Majorum efligies habeant insignia vocis :

Ante pedes Domiti long-um tu pone Thyestae
Syl-ma vel Antigones, tu personam Menalippes,

Et de marmoreo citharam suspende colosso.

Arina tamen vos

Nocturna et llamnias domibus templisque parastis,

225. Ρθι·ςᾳνὶιια acl pulpila] Resides
Naples (ν. 219, 11.) Suetonius· says he went
through Achaia, and various parts of
Greeee, reciting in the theatres and eou-
tendiug sor the prizes at the. Olympio
gamos. Hem'as highly deliglited with
the flattery of the Achaeans, who sent
him all the erowns of the mnsieians as if
he were Apollo and the guardian of the
Muses (says Casaubou). He declax-ed
therefore that the Greeks were the only
persons who had carS, and were wortliy
of him and his genius, ‘Cautu,’ ‘eau-
tare' (V. 220) mean only recitation. See
Salmasius’ note on Suetonius (Nero 21,
Burmann’s edition): ‘¹ Inter caetera ean-
tavit Canacem parlarienlem, Orestem
matricidam, Oedipodem eaeeaecatum, Iler-
culem insanum.”

226. apium meruisse coronae] I'arsley
was used for erowning the head at feasts,
as we see repeatedly 111 Horace, as C. ii.

“ Quis udo
Deproperare apio coronas
Curatve myrto Ρ ”

iv. 11. 3: “est in horto, Phylli, nectendis
apium coronis.” It was used for the
crown of the victors iu the Isthmian and
Nemean gamos, wherefore Pindar calls it
Dorian and Corinthiam θάλησε Κορινθίοις
σελίνοις (Nem. iv. 88, Bai-kh), Δωρίων
στεφάνωμα σελίνων (Isth. ii. 16). See
also Olymp. xiii. 32, and Isth. vii. 64. The
Olympic crown was of olive, aud the
Pythian of laurel. Pliny speaking of
parsley says, “honos ipsi in Achaia coro-
nare victores sacri certaminis Nemeae'’
(H. N. xix. 8).

228. Ante pedes Domiti] Nero's name
before his adoption by his stepsather
Claudius was 1.. Domitius Ahenobarbus,
and in that branch of the Domitia gens
there were many distinguished persons
(see Smith's Biog. Diet.) whose bustis were

in his palace. The poet tells him to hang
up by their images his stage dresses aud
harp, as soldiers hung their ιιι-1110111· aud
spoils. ‘ ¹<yrina’ was a train attached to
the ‘palla,' worn by tragic actors, from
σύρειν, to sweep. Horace refers to it,
A. P. 215: “traxitque vagus per pulpita
vestem '' (where see note); and sec below
xv, 30, “quanquam omnia syrmata volvas.'’
Varius’ tragedy of Thyestes is referred to
by Horace, C. i. 6. 8, “ saevam Pelopis
domum? Ennius and Accius each wrote
a tragedy on Menalippe the daughter of
Aeolus, after two tragedies of Euripides,
of which fragments still exist. [Ribbeck
has ⁴ seu personam Melanippi.'] By ‘ niar-
moreo colosso ’ he means a colossal statue
of one of his aneestors. Suetonius says
that he ordered a harp (or a crown, for
the readings vary) awarded him on some
occasion as a prize to be taken and placed
by a statue of Augustus (Nero, c. 12), and
for this reason some counnentators think
the statue here is that of Augustus, but
that is against the context. Nero had a.
statue of himself in his palaee called the
golden house (Sueton. Nero, e. 31), which
statue was 120 feet high, but it was of
bronze [as Pliny states (H. N. 31·. c.. 7), aud
the work of Zenodorus. Nero was also so
silly as to have a colossal painting made
of himself on canvas, 120 feet high.
Fortunately the ugly thing was soon burnt.
(Pliny, H. N. 35. c. 7)].

231. Quid, Catilina, tais] Catilina was
of the Sergia gens, one. of the oldest patri-
eian funalia-2, and Cethegus, his chief
companion in his conspiracy, was of the
Cornelia gens. A very complete account
of *the conspirators aud their designs will
he found in ΜΓ. Loug's Introduction to
Cicero’s orations against Catilina (vol.
111.). [ln v. 233 Ribbeck has ‘para-

234. Ut Braeeatorum pueri] As sons
of the Braceati or descendants of the Sc-
