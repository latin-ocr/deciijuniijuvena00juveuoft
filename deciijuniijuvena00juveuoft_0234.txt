Sidus et occulti miranda potentia fati?

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

200

Servis regna dabunt, captivis fata triumphos.
Felix ille tamen corvo qnoque rarior albo.
Poenituit multos vanae sterilisque cathedrae,
Sicut Thrasymaehi probat exitus atque Secundi

Carinatis ε

et hunc inopem vidistis, Athenae,

205

Nil praeter gelidas ausae conferre cicutas.
Di majorum umbris tenuem et sine pondere terram

“ Concurrite omnes augures, haruspices 3
Portentum inusitatum conflatum est
reeens,
Nam mulos qui fricabat consul faetus
est.”

Ventidius greatly distinguished himself as
the ‘legatus' of M. Antonius against the
Parthians, and defeated and slew their
most redoubtable leaders Labienus and
Pacorus, Rc. 39, 38. (See Horace, C. iii.
6. 9, n.) Ventidius had 11 triumph uc.
38, fifty-one years after he had himself
followed in l'ompeius’ procession as a
prisoner (Dion Cass. 43. 51, and Dict.
Biog.

By)Tullins he means the king Servius
Tullius, whose mothel Omisia, according
to the story, was a prisoner of war and a
slave. To him the following wor‘ds Sel-
vis regna dabunt’ refer, and‘ captivis fata
triumphos' to Ventidius. See viii. 259:
“ Ancilla natus trabeam et diadema Qui-
rini.''

202. corvo quoque rarior alba] See
note on vi. 165: “nigroque simillima
cygno.'' He says, though Fortune does
play these tricks sometimes, still Quin-
tilian must be looked upon as a lucky man,
and one of a small number.

203. Poenztuitvmltos] Many have got
tired of the vain and plofitless (11 111· that
is, the professm' s chair. He instanees
Thrasymachus and Secundus Carinas. The
first was one of the sophists who came to
Athens about the middle of the fifth century
B. C. He taught rhetoric 1n particular, and
had a high reputation. He was a n 1ῒίνο of
Chalcedon. His end, which Juvenal alludes
to, is not known on any other authority
than that of the Scholiast on this place,
who says he hanged himself. The cause is
not stated. Secundus Carinas (orcam—inas)
was a rhetorician of whom Dion Cassius
(59. 20) says that Caligula sent him into
exile, because he declaimed in his school
against tyrants, which he gives as an in-
stance of the malignant and suspicions
temper of that tyrant. If the student

follows Ruperti's note, he will suppose
that Dion says Carinas went to Athens,
but he does not, nor (1003 Juvenal. ‘ Hunc '
means Socrates, the person obviously al-
luded to in the following line. His poverty
was proverbial. The demonstrative pro-
nonn, where the context makes the mean-
ing plain, has more force than the name,
and Socrates' name was not convenient.
We might have expected ‘ illum’ instead
of ‘ hunc,' or after ‘ hunc ² a clause with the
relative 3 and accordingly Heinrich thinks
a verse is lost after 205. This is not un·
likely 3 but there is no doubt whom J nve-
nal means. Ruperti takes ‘ hune' for
Carinas, and M r. Mayor for some one later
than he, “who when banished retired to
Athens, and there, as no one would ven-
ture to employ him, put an end to his life
by taking poison.’' Juvenal speaks of So-
crates again as

“ —— senex vicinus Hymetto
Qui partem acceptae saeva inter vincla

cicutae
Accusatori nollet dare.’' (S. xiii. 185.)

207. Di majorum umbris] He prays the
gods that the earth may lie light on the
ashes of the men of old, and flowers bloom
in perpetual spring over their tombs, be-
cause they looked upon the teacher as
holding the place of a father to his pupils,
and paid him reverenee accordingly. He
contrasts the respect Achilles showed to
his tutor, Chiron the Centaur‚ with the
treatment of modern teachers of rhetoric
by their pupils3 and yet he says there
might have been some excuse even in those
(111·13 for laughing at the old music master
with his 1101 se s tail hanging behind him.
According to Honur Chiron taught Achilles
medicine. Other traditions add music and
other accomplislnnents. Juvenal says he
remained in subjection to his teacher till
he was come to man's stature. One tra-
dition makes ont that 110 was taken to Troy
at nine years of age, which is absurd.
Chiron lived on Monnt Pelion in Thessaly.
