163. sexta Quaque die] Casaubon quotes
these lines 111 11 note on Suetonius, vit.
Tiberii, 0. 32, where he says that Diogenes,
a grammarian of Rhodes, being wont to
hold disputations every seventh day (dis-
putare Sabbatis solitus) would not admit
Tiberius out of the regular order, “ac per
servulum suum 111 septimum diem distu-
leratf’ On the same passage Casaubon
says that the Greeks, especially the AsiaticS,
commonly observed the J ewish distinction
of weeks, and every seventh day the boys 111
50110015 had a holiday. J osephus (c. Apio-
nem, ii. c. 40) says that in his time there
was not a nation under the 51111 that did not
celebrate the J ewish Sabbath, an assertion
which it is strange Casaubon should have
quoted as if it were true. (See note on
Horace, S. i. 9. 69.) Suetonius (de Illust.
Gramm. c. 7) says of M. Antonius Gnipho,
“docuit autem et rhetoricam ita ut quotidie
praecepta eloquentiae traderet, declamaret
vero non nisi nundinis? '’ This Arcadian
youth, as the man calls him, came but one
day' m six, and that was enough for his poor
teacher.

161. dirus caput Hannibal implet ,·]
Horace uses this epithet for Hannibal three
times (C. ii. 12. 2; 111. 6. 36, iv. 4. 42),
and the boys were always repeating it. The
master uses itin 11 double sense. Hannibal’ 5
name was a bugbear with which uurses
frightened children, and the Romans to the
latest times held it in respect. His exploits
were constant themes for declamation. See
x. 166:

“ —-- Ι, demens, 01 saevas curre per Alpes
Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias.'’

Livy sayS, that, after the battle of Cannae,

Maherbal, the commander of Hannibal’s
cavalry, advised him to push on, and in four
days hc might sup in the Capitol ς that
Hannibal applauded his geueral’s spirit, but
took time to consider, and that the day so
lost was the salv ation of Rome (xxii. 51).
then Hannibal marched an army from
Capua 10 Rome (sec above, vi. 290), 110
offered battle to 1110 00115015, Livy says
(xxvi. 11), but on each of 1110 consecutive
days the armies were prevented from engag-
ing by a violent 5101111, which subsided as
soon as they had returned to their camps.
The poet Silius takes up the same fable and
says (Pun. xii. 661, sqq.):

“Invadit Notus, ac piceam cum grandine
multa
Intorquens nubem cunctantem et vana.
minantem
Circumagit, castrisque ducem succedere
cogit.”

It seems as if Juvenal had borrowed his
word ‘circumagit,' ‘ wheels about?

165. Quantum vis stipulare] In the form
of conti-act which was called ‘obligatio
verbis,' the parties contracted by question
and answer. “Dari spondes? Spondeo.
Dabis? Dab0,'’ &c. The person who
asked the questions was said ‘ stipulari,5 and
was called ‘ stipulator ι’ 1110 011101 was called
ίρ1·0111155ο1,’1111(1 was said ‘spondere.' (See
Long’s article ‘Obligationes' in Smith’s
Dict. Ant.) The teacher offers to make a
bargain with any one that pleases, to give
him any amount if he will get the dunce’s
father to listen to him as often as his
teaeher had done. He makes the other
man ‘stipulator ' and himself ‘promissor.'
Persius speaks of his father going with
a party of friends to hear his son’s nonsense
(iii. 47). Jahn has “Quantum vis stipu-
lare, et protinus accipe, quid d0,” which
Mr. Mayor tries to explain, but hc is not
successful. There is no meaning 111 11.
The MSS. nearly all have ‘quod.' [Rib-
beck has ‘protinus accipe, qui do: Ut'
&c.]
