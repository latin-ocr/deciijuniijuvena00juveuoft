Negliget iratus, quod rem curtaveris3 urnae

Ossa inodora dabit, seu spirent cinnama surdum :35
Seu ceraso peccent casiae nescire paratus.

Tunc bona incolumis minuas? Et Bestius urget
Doctores Graios: “ Ita fit, postquam sapere urbi

is a dinner given to the friends of the de-
ceased aster the funeral. It hus nothing to
do with the ¹ silicernium,' concerning which
see J uv. v. 85, “ feralis coena.’' The friends
met and speeches were commonly made on
30011 occasions as at wedding breakfasts
with us, the chief subject being the merits
of the principal person concerned. The
dinner was sometimes mentioned in the
will. See Hor. S. ii. 3, 86, n. “ epulum
arbitrio Αι·1·1.”

34. urnae Ossa inodora dabit,] There is
a variant ‘ inhonora,' but the other is the
true word. It was usual to sprinkle odours
on the ashes when they were put into the
urn. Tibullus, giving directions for his
burial (iii. 2. 23), begs, that, when his bones
are placed in the urn, all manner of per-
fumae may be brought,

“ Illuc quas mittit dives Panchaia merceS,
Eoique Arabes pinguis et Assyria.''

Ovid also says (Trist. iii. 3. 65. 69),

“Ossa tamen facito parva referantur in

urna,
Atque ⁹⁸3¹, cum foliis et amomi pulvere
misce.

‘ Surdus‚’ like κῶφος, has reference properly
to the failure of hearing either actively or
passively. (See note on 28.) But it came
to be applied more generally to any thing
dull and spiritless. (See Forcellini.) ‘ Spi-
rent surdum' means ‘they give no scent
at all‚’ or a flat one: “acutum odorem non
reddunt '' (Schol.). The adulteration of
the olive oil with oil of casia is referred to
above (ii. 64). That of casia with an ex·
tract from the cherry-trec is nowhere else
mentioned. ‘Nescire paratus‚' ‘ he is pre-
pared not to know‚' is a sarcastic way of
speaking.

37. Tunc bona incolumis minuas ?]
These words are usually attributed to the
‘heres,' abusing the man after 1113 death.
In that case the reading supposed is
‘tune’ [which Jahn has]. Heinrich with
a few MSS. reads ‘tunc,’ and says they
are the words of the poet. 1Ιο takes
no notice of the metrica] difficulty, but
I think the hiatus may be got over, 83

10 “ 111810 ominatis’' (Horace. C. iii. 14.
11). If this is right, as l incline to think
it is, the poet asks ironically, ‘and 11100
would you not be mad to eurtail your
estateP’ that is, with such a terrihlc
prospect after your death. ¹ Incolu·
mis' is used in this sense of ‘sanus’ by
Horace, S. ii. 3. 132, “Incolumi capite
esP'' He also 1183 “male tutae mentis”
in the same satire (137).

—- Et Bestius urget] ‘And then
with the airs of a Bestius he (the
‘heres ') will go on to attack the Greek
doctors.' Persius has obviously borrowed
this name from Horace (Epp. i. 15. 37,

n.).

“ Scilicet 01 ventres lamna candente nepo-
tum
Diceret urendos, corrector Bestius.'’

Nothing is known of this man, whose
name was proverbial for severe censure,
either in a public or private character.
For ‘et' most MSS. have ‘sed,' which
does not give any good sense.

38. Ita fit, postquam sapere urbi]
‘This is always the way, ever since this
taste of ours was iinported with pepper
and palsas? ‘Sapere hoc' is like ‘nos-
trum vivere,' &c. (S. i. 9, n.) Pepper
and palms came from the coast of Syria
(v. 136), from whence J uvenal’s man Um-
bricius complains that the Romans got so
much vice (iii. 62, sqq. n.), “Jam pridem
Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes.'’ The
commentators are much troublcd by ‘ma-
ris expers? Casaubon was the first who
thought of ‘ maris ’ being the genitive of
· lnas,’ and the sense being ‘ emasculated.’
Weber approves this interpretation, and
compares i. 103, “ si testiculi vena ulla pa-
terni Viveret in nobis ?¹' Our translator-s
Halliday and Gifl'ord so render the words.
But it is manifest that Persius, in whose
mind the words of Horace were continually
running, thought of “Chium maris cx-
pers '' (S. ii. 8. 15), and whatever he may
have taken the meaning to be there, he
meant herc. One of the interpretatione of
‘ maris expers ' in the passage of Horace 13
¹ without salt water‚’which was mixed with
