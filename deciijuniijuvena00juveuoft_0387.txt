SATIRA xlv,

:5:57

Atque habitas, Coro semper tollendus et Auso-0,
l’enlitus ae vilis sacci mereator olentis;

Qui gaudes pingue antiquae dc litore Cretae

Passum et municipes Jovis advexisse lag-enas ’ἕ
IIie tamen ancipiti lig-ens vestig-ia planta

Victum illa mercede parat brumamque saniemque
Illa reste eavet; tu propter mille talenta

Et eentum villas temerarius,

Aspice. portus ‘275

Et plenum magnis trabibus mare3 plus hominum estjam
In pelago 3 veniet elassis quoeunque vocarit
Spes lucri, nec Carpathium Gaetulaque tantum

fron. Horace speaks of it as an ing-redient
in an excellent sance (S. ii. 4. 68: “ Cory-
cioque croco sparsum stetit”). This ex-
plains ‘sacci olentis,' the sweet-smelling
bag. Ruperti says Corycus in Crete is
meant, because Crete is mentioned below
(v. 270), which, if there were no better
reason, would show that this is not Crete.
The author of the article ‘ Corycus ’ (the
Cretan) in Dict. Geog. says J uvenal's ves-
sel “evidently belonged to this town.’'
There is no evidence of the kind. As to
Corus scex. 180. Hermann thinks v. 269
an interpolation because of its “nimia
acerbitaS‚” and hc adds “ipsum orationis
cursum inanis amplificationis strepitus
tau-dat? which is not intelligible to me.

271. Passum et municipe-5 Jovis] ‘ Pas-
sum' was ‘raisin wine,' for which Crete
was famous. Martial calls it the poor
man’s ‘ mulsum :’

“ Gnossia Minoae genuit vindemia Cretae
Hoc tibi, quod mulsum pauperis esse
solet.'’ (xiii. 106.)

The Cretans had a Zeus of their own.
Rhea, to save the child she was ready to
give birth to from his father Cronos, hid
herself in a cave of Mount Dicte or Ida
in Crete, with which island the early years
of Zeus are commonly connected (sce xiii.
41). The wine-jars therefore are said to
be conum-ymen of Jove’s, as the ‘siluri '
are called ‘ municipes' of Crispinus (iv.

272. Hic tamen] That is the ‘funam-
bulus’ (v. 266). “The rope-dancer how-
ever, ifhe hazards his life, does so to avoid
starvation ι you hazard yours not to obtain
necessat-ies but superfiuitieS‚ to add another
to your 999 talents or your 99 mansions ’³
(Mayor). 1 see nothing about 999 talents
or 99 mansions. He says the man follows
his rash trade to geta great deal of money

and a great many houses, while the other
follows his to keep out eold and hunger.
See above, ν. 86, n.: “Aedificator crat Ce-
tronius.'' ‘ Es ' must bc understood after
‘ temerarius?

276. plenum maynis trabibus mare ;]
‘ Trabs' is sometimes used for a ship, as in
Horace, C. i. 1. 13: “ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.”
Achaintre's note on ‘plus hominum est
jam,' ‘⁶ Qui naufragium pertulerunt quam
qui evaserunt‚'' is derived from the Scho-
liast, who is plainly wrong. Juvenal says
there are more nien at sea thau on shore.
The use of the comparative where one
branch ot' the comparison is not expressed
is common: as, for instance, v. 31 of this
satire: “ velocius et citius nos Corrum-
punt vitiorum exempla domestica.'' 'rho
Carpathian sea was named from the island
Carpathos directly between Rhodes and
Crete.

‘⁶ Quicunque Bithyna lacessit
Carpathium pelagus carina.''

(Hor. c. i. 35. s.)

Gaetulia only touched the coast of the
Atlantic. It was separated from the Medi-
terranean by Mauretania, Numidia, and
the province Africa 3 but ‘Gaetuli ' is com-
monly used for the Africans, and here
‘Gaetula aequora’ is put looscly for the
African waters of the Mcditerranean. Mons
Calpe is the present Rock of Gibraltar.
Juvenal says this multitude of ships will
not only cross the Carpathian and Libyan
sea8‚ but pass the pillars of Hercules (of
which Calpe was one and Abyla on the
African coast was the other) and hear the
sun hissing as he sets iu the western
waters. Horace uses ‘transilio' in this

way : “ Nou tangenda rates transiliunt.
vada '’ (C. i. 3. 24).
