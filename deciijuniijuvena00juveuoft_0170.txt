D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nupta Senatori comitata est Hippia ludium
Ad Pharon et Nilum famosaque moenia Lagi,
Prodigia et mores urbis damnante Canopo.

Immemor illa domus ct conjugis atque sororis

Nil patriae indulsit, plorantesque improba natos,
thue magis stupeas, ludos Paridemque reliquit.
Sed quanquam in magnis opibus plumaque paterna
Et segmentatis dormisset parvula cunis,

Contempsit pelagus ε famam contempserat olim,

Cujus apud molles minima est jactura cathedras
Tyrrhenos igitur fluctus lateque sonantem

not certain. They are also called Galli,
because they wore arms like those of the
Gauls. See S. viii. 200. What Juvenal
says is, “ Go and marry, that on your fine
bed your wife may lie in of a child got by
Euryalus the gladiator, and expressing his
features.” The MSS. have ‘et’ or ‘aut'
after Euryalum, except P„ which has ‘Au-
ryaluln xnyrinilionem.' ‘ Exprimere' is
taken from the meulding of wax.

82. Nupta Senatori] This senator is
A. Fabricius Veiento, mentioned above, iii.
185, iv. 113, and in this satire, v. 113. His
wife, Hippia, is mentioned again in x. 220.
The gladiator (ludius) with whom she
eloped into Egypt was named, as we see
below, Sergius. Ludium, followed close
by ‘ad‚’ forms a dissyllable (see v. 10, n.),
or the middle syllable forms one with the
following, as ‘ semianimum ' in iv. 37.
Ρ. and other MSS. have ‘ludum.’

83. Ad Pharon et Nilum] Pharos is
the island opposite to Alexandria which,
being joined with the mainland by a mole
(Heptastadium), formed the two liarbours
of that town. The mole has since grown
into terra firma (on which the present city
stands), and the island has thereby become
part of the continent, by the accumulation
of soil about it. Ruperti thinks ‘ famosa'
is the same as ‘inclyta,' a sense it seldom
bears, and quite out of place here. The
infamous walls of Lagus are those of Alex-
andria, which was the capital of 'the Ptole-
mies, of whom the son of Lagus Ptole-
maeus Soter, was the first (B.0. 323—285).

84. damnante Canopo] Canobus or Ca-
nopus, a sea-port at that mouth of the
Nile which bears its name, about fifteen
miles from Alexandria, was notorious for
profligacy. But Juvenal says Canopus it-
self would cry shame on such monstrous
wickedness. He says elsewhere (xv. 44) :

horrida sane
Aegyptus: sed luxuria quantum ipse no-
Baielialra famoso non cedit turba Canop0.”

 

Horace speaks of the Egyptian queen as
attended, “contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum” (C. i. 37. 9), and laments
that a Roman soldier “ spadonibus servire
rugosis potest '³ (Epod. ix. 13). They were
a profligate race no doubt. ‘Prodigia et
mores’ is oue subject, as ‘per famam et
populum ' (S. i. 72).

87. ludos Paridemque reliquia] This is
the climax of her infatuationx to neglect
her home, her husband, her sister, her
country, and her children was much, but
to run away from the games was more. This
matter has been referred to before on S. iii.
223. Paris was a native of Egypt, a pan-
tomimus in Domitian's time of great ce-
lebrity‚ and in high favour with the emperor
till the empress Domitia fell in love with
him. When Domitian learned this, he
divorced his wife and put Paris to death.
He is mentioned below, vii. 87. Martial
wrote his epitaph, in which he gives him
the highest praise :

“ Quisquis Flaminiam teris, viator,
Noli nobile praeterire marmor.
Urbis deliciae, salesque Nili,
Ars et gratia, lusus et voluptas,
Romani decus et dolor theatri,
Atque omnes Veneres, Cupidinesque,
Hoc sunt condita quo Paris sepulcro.’'

(xi. 13.)

88. plumaque paterna] Pluma means a
feather bed or pillow. As to ‘ segmenta,’
see on S. ii. 124.

91. minima est jactura cathedras] He
says she who had been brought up so deli-
cately from her infancy despised the dangers
