Seriolae veterem metuens deradere limum

Ingemit, ‘Hoc bene sit !' tunicatum cum sale mordens 30
Caepe et, farratam pueris plaudentibus ollam,

Pannosam faecem morientis sorbet aceti ?'’

At si unctus cesses et figas in cute solem,

Est prope te ignotus cubito qui tangat, et acre

Despuat in mores, penemque arcanaque lumbi

Runcantem populo marcentes pandere vulvas:

“ Tu cum maxillis balanatum gausape pectas,
Inguinibus quare detonsus gurgulio extat P
Quinque palaestritae licet haec plantaria vellant,

Elixasque nates labefactent forcipe adunca,

40

Non tamen ista filix ullo mansuescit aratro.'’
Caedimus inque vicem praebemus crura sagittis.

at the ‘compita’ and ou the occasion ate
and drank very poor fare. We may there-
fore dismiss the Compitalia, as Casaubon
does. At the principal cross-roads there
were small chapels dedicated to the Lares
CompitaleS, and there the Scholiast says
it was the custom of farmers to hang
up their yokes when broken, a remark due,
it may be supposed, to this passage, and
not worth much. As observed on Horace,
Epp. i. 1. 4:

“ Veianius armis

Herculis ad postem fixis latet abditus

ssgr0,”

it was usual for persons giving up any
particular calling to dedicate their tools,
&c., to some god. This the commentators
refer to. But here a repeated act is im-
plied in ‘quandoque,’ and it cannot there-
fore be referred to the man's retirement
from fal-ming. We must, I think, remain
ignorant of the occasions on which the
111111101- dedicated his yoke, admitting that
a dedication to the Lares Compitales is
meant. It appears that on such occasions,
whatever they were, the household had a
feast, which according to the speaker
went against the grain with Vectidius,
‘ Quandoque' for ‘ quandocunque ’ is twice
used by Horace, C. iv. 1. 17, “Et quan-
doque potentior,’' &c., and 2. 34, ‘⁴ Cae·
'sarem quandoque trahet feroces,¹’ &c-
See Forcellini.

29. Seriolae veterem] ‘ Seria’ was one
of the different sorte of jars in which wine
was kept, and ‘ seriola’ was a small one of
the same sort. This man is said with all
his riches to 110 unwilling to take off the dirt
from his old jar to draw the wine, and

 

prays that no harm may come of such
extravagance. ⁸ Hoc bene sit‚’ ‘quod bene
sit,' were ordinary forms of prayer, espe-
cially when there was any thing doubtful
about the matter iu hand. ‘Tunicatum
caepe' is a raw onion with the shell 011.
See Juv. xiv. 153. “Tunicam mihi malo
lupini,'' &cu ‘ Farratam ollam ’ is a jar of
porridge, ‘puls.’ See Juv. xi. 109, where
‘farrata' is used absolutely for ‘pultes'
See also his description of the young
rustics’ supper, “grandes fumabant pul-
tibus ollae’' (xiv. 171). The slaves clapped
their hands when they saw this mess, It
was an improvement on their ordinary
meals: but what could they have been?
for ‘far' was the daily allowance of slaves
in general. He calls the wine ‘ the ragged
dregs of dying vinegar?

Casaubou, Passow, aud most editors,
have ‘farrata olla,' and Heinrich says this
is equivalent to ‘plaudentibus ad ollam'
or ‘de olla? But I do not think this is
Latin. All Orelli's MSS„ some of Achain-
tre's, and several others, have the accu-
sative, which Jahn has adopted. The
only way in which the ablative can be
understood is by making it absolute and
using ‘farrata’ strictly as a passive par-
ticiple, ‘ pueris’ being the dative, “ While
a pot is filled with ‘far' for the slaves
who clap their hands.’'

33. Ac si unctus cesses] ‘ But if you be
not a thristy liver like Vectidius, but self-

indulgent, like Alcibiades (see v. 18), then ,

pcople will find something worse to say of
you.’ What they say the reader will be
glad to pass over.

42. Caedimus inque vicem] Horace
has something like this (Epp. ii. 2. 97),
