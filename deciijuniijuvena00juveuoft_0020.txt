great crowd& and with great succes& several times : so that 110 was led i
to insert in his first writings thosc verses which he had written first ε ,i

‘ Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio : tu Camerinos
Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos 2?

The player was at that time 0110 of the favourites at court, and many of i
his supporters were daily promoted. Juvenal, therefore, fell under
suspicion as one who had covcrtly censui-cd the times3 and forthwith
under colour of military promotion, though hc was eighty years of age,
he was removed from the city, and sent to be praefectus of a cohort
which was stationed in the farthest part of Egypt. That sort of
punishment was determined upon as being suited to a light and jocular
offence. Within a very short time he died of vexation and disgust.'’

The chief points stated in the foregoing life are, that Juvenal was the
son of a rich freedman either by birth or by adoption (for this I suppose
thc writer means) 3 that he was a practised rhetorician3 that 110 began
to write satire after middle life, that his first attempt was an epigram
upon Paris the pantomimus³; that he was encouraged by the success of
this production to write Satires on a larger scale, which at first he
concealed‚ but afterwards read them to large audiences with great
applause ; that whereas he was rash enough to introduce in one of his
poems the original epigram (which, as Ι suppose the writer means to
imply, so became more public, and probably for the first time reached
the ears of the person it was aimed at), Paris by his influence at
court obtained his banishment‚ under the honourable form of a military
command, to the farthest part of Egypt ; that he was then eighty-years
of age ⁴, and that he shortly died of vexa-tion.

Another of these notices states that Juvenal was born at Aquinum,
in the reign of Claudins; that he returned from exile, survived the
reign of Trajan, and, finally died of old age in a fit of coughing. ’

Ι11 a third we are told that when he returned to Rome, finding his
friend Martial was dead, he died of grief in his eighty-second year.

A fourth says it was Domitian who exiled him ; that he never re-
turned, but that after correcting and adding to his Satires in Egypt, he
died there of old age in the reign of Antoninus Pius.

From a fifth we learn that he was advanced to the equestrian rank
through his own merit3 that the place of his honourable exile was
Scotland‚ and that the motive was that he might be killed in battle3

³ Thbiighothsgrz were two players of this name, one a favourite of Nero, the other of

Domitian, there can be no doubt the writer means Domitian’s man.
⁴ As Paris was put to death Λα). 83, this would make Juvenal to have been born
about the year one of the Christian era (vi. 87, note).
