was applied to the keeper of the acra-
rium, a head-gardencr (see below, v. 228),
a busser, and a superintendent of the city
pipes or aqneducts (villicus a plumbo).
Here it means the agent of the owner. ln
iv. 77 it is put for the ‘ praefectus urbis.’
¹ Itabeutibus’ means ‘ the falling walls!
The construction of the received text is
unusual. If it is right, then it must be
taken as one of those conditional sentences
in which ‘si’ is not expressed, and the
sense must be, ‘ for if the ‘¹ villicus '' only
props up the houses, and patches the
rents, he bids the inhabitants sleep se-
cure.’ Heinrich takes only one clause,
‘veteris—hiatum‚’ so ; but it is better to
take both if either. Ι know no instance
in which such a clause is introduced in the
middle osa sentence. Ruperti, Jahn [and
Ribbeck] adopt what seems to me no more
than a substitution of the copyists sor
‘ contexit‚' ‘ cum texit,’ which appears
in P. and a few other MSS. The Aldine
Editions, Pullmann’s, and one or two others
of that day, have ‘ si ’ for ‘ sic ς’ and if that
had now any authority from MSS. 1 should
have adopted it. 1 believe it to be the
right word. ‘ Sic ' reads awkwardly.

198. jam frivola transfert] ‘Frivola '
Forcellini explains as ‘pauper supellex,'
‘ his small wares or furniture.' Juvenal calls
the man Ucalegon, having in mind Aeneas'
description of the buming of Troy :

 

“ jam Deiphobi dedit ampla ruinam
Vtzlrcgpto superante domus ς jam proximus

Ucalegon .” (Aen. ii. 310.)

‘Jam’ is only introduced to make the scene
more present. He says, ‘ Here is Ucale-
gon crying for water, carrying off his fur-
niture3 the flames are mounting; your
third story is smoking and you are asleep;
for though so much bustle is going on be-
low he gets warning last who lives at the
top of the house :' so that (he means) even

latuiu’ is that which is laid down with
boards, ‘ tabulae,’ and so is used for a story
of a house. Three stories were only found
iu lodging-houses; and the ‘tertia tabu-
latu ’ were the ‘ coenacula ' referred to
above (v. 166, n.). ‘ Trepidare,' which
means running to and fro, contains the
root ‘ trep-’ which appears in τρέπω. See
Hor. C. ii. 11. 4, n.

202. ubi reddunt ova] It is hardly cre-
diblc that Ruperti should have supposed
that Juvenal is here playing upon the word
ὑπερῷον, ‘an upper chamber,³ as if it were
derived from ὠὸν, an egg. He might as
well say that πατρῷον, μητρῷον, were com-
pounded of eggs.

203. Lectus erat Codro] He puts the
case as if it was true. It does not follow
that it was so, or that Codrus is the man
mentioned as the author of the Theseid
(i. 2). The name is given as Codrus here
and in v. 208, in one M S. (Vatican), and
by correction in P. (see i. 2, n.) One of
the Scholiasts says Procula was a dwarf,
and so most of the translators take it.

“Codrus had but one bed3 so short to
Thizitoliis short wife's short legs hung
dangling out.'' (Dryden.)

“ Shorter then's dwarf-wife Codrus had a
Itkreril' six little jug-s on’s cupboard’s
head.” (Stapylton.)

From den's translation, it might be
interred that ‘lectus ' was a slceping bed.
But for that, it would hardly be necessary
to tell the reader that Juvenal means a
‘lectus tricliniaris? Holyday, Dryden,
and Gifford translate ‘abacus' ‘his cup-
hoard’s head' too. But ‘abacus' was
a side-table (sce Hor. S. ii. 2. 4, n.)
on which rich people made a show of
their plate. This man was poor, and had
only half -a-dozen little ear-theuwarc or glass

here too the poor man is worst off. ‘Tabu- jugs (Hor Α. P. 21 n.) to adom his side-
