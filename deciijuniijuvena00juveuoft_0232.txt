D. JUNH JUVENALIS

Chrysogonus quanti doceat vel Pollio quanti
Lautorum pueros, artem scindens Theodori.
Balnea sexcentis et pluris porticus in qua

Gestetur dominus quoties pluit.
Exspectet spargatque luto jumenta recenti?

Hic potiuS, namque hic mundae nitet ungula mulae.
Parte alia longis Numidarum fulta columnis

Sui-gat et algentem rapiat coenatio solem.
Quanticunque domus, veniet qui fercula docte

Componat, veniet qui pulmentaria condat.

gratuitous distribution was called ‘ frumen-
tatio? In the time of Augustus it was given
montlssy, and was a thing expected (Suet.
vit. Aug. 40) It was an easy way of
secui-ing the lower sort of people. The
quantity was not much, and the value
of the ‘tessera‚' if a man sold it, as
he might, was small. Ruperti takes
‘vilis’ with ‘frumenti.' It belongs to
‘ tessera?

176. Chrysogonus quanli] Chrysogonus
and Pollio were music masters. They were
mentioued 111 the last satire (v. 74 and v.
387). Theodorus was a rhetorician. Ru-
perti’s note is a ι1111111)Ιο of explanations
after his fashion. He gives the true
meaning, and then says “quidam putant ''
something else 3 and finishes with “sed
verum forte h. 1. 5011511111 cepit Ach. cujus
nota est :⁹³ and Achaintre's note, which he
says is “ forte vera,'’ gives an obscene turn
to the sense, quite foreign to Juvenal's
meaning and to Ruperti's own view of it.
¹ Scindens’ is here but nowhere else used
in the sense of cutting up, as we sometimes
say. ‘ Proscindere ’ is used in that sense.
(See For-cell.) He tells them to go and
see what sums of money these music mas-
ters charge the boys of the rich, while
they laugh at Theodorus' trade. Jahn
has changed the MSS. reading ‘ scindens'
into ‘scindes' [which Ribbeck also has]‚
and Mr. Mayor explains thus: “Make but
a trial of the gains of music masters, and

monis artem.''

178. Balnea sexcentis] These rich
teat-hers build themselves baths for an
enormous sum, 600‚000 sestertii (about
5000l. sterling), and covered drives for still
more (see iv. 5, n.). Here they drive in wet
weather. Are they to wait till it is fine, aud

then get their horses splashed all over with
mud? Heinrich thinks v. 18115 a piece
of late patchwork [and Ribbeck omits it].
It does not increase the strength of the
satire. The verse before says enough.

182. Parte alia lonqis] His baths here,
his drives there, his dining-room elsewhere
with tall pillars of yellow marble from
Numidia. See note on Hor. C. ii. 18. 3:
“Non trabes Hymettiae Premunt colum-
nas ultima recisas Africa.'’ It is so
constructed as to catch the winter’s
sun. But whatever the house costs, the
establishment will be in proportion. The
person referred to in v. 184 is the
‘ structor' mentioned S. v. 120, where see
note. ‘ Pulmentaria' are savoury dishes,
or sauces (see note on Horace, Epp. i. 18.
48), and the reading which Lachmann has
invented and Jahn adopted, ‘condiat‚' 15
quite out of place. ‘Condat’ is here to
make up. The reading of most MSS. is
‘condit,' and some have ‘componit' to
correspond. But the subjunctive is wanted
[Ribbeck has ‘ condit’]. There will be a
man to arrange the courses and make up
the savoury messes.

186. Quintiliano] See vi. ¹75, 280.
Two sestertia would be about seventeen
guineaS‚ a small sum for the whole course,
and that to the first rhetorician of the
age: but he says it is a large sum com-
pared with what is usual. Quintilian
was rich, it seems, among poor men, and '
poor among the rich. When his daughter
was going to be married, Pliny the Younger
sent him a present of 50‚000 sestertii
(between 400l. and 500l.) as a small
contribution towards her outfit. He says
(Epp. vi. 32), “te porro animo beatis-
simum modicum facultatibus scio, itaque
partem oneris tui mihi vindico‚” and that
he would have sent more, but that he
could only hope to induce the decLaimer to
