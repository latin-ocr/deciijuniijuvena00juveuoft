A. PERSII FLACCI

Contemnere: sonat vitium percussa, maligne
Respondet viridi non cocta fidelia limo.
Udum et molle lutum es, nunc, nune properandus et acri

Fingendus sine fine rota.

Sed rure paterno
Est tibi far modicum, purum et sine labe salinum,

25

(Quid metuas P) cultrixque foci secura patella :

Hoc satis.

An deceat pulmonem rumpere ventis,

Stemmate quod Tusco ramum millesime ducis,
Censorem fatuum vel quod trabeate salutas?

Ad populum phaleras, ego te intus et in ente novi.

24. Sed rure paterno] He supposes the
youth to say that he is a gentleman, and
need not trouble himself about learning.
He does not mean to say that he is rich,
but he has got a sufficient estate and a
good pedigree. ‘ Far modicum' is a fair
amount of arable land. He was one of
those of whom Horace says (C. ii. 16. 13):

“ Vivitur parvo bene cui paternum
Splendet in mensa tenui salinum.’'

See note on Hor. S. i. 3. 14, “ Concha salis
puri.'’ The salt—cellar was an heirloom
in all good families, and the man boasts
that his has come down without a blot.
‘ Quid metuas,' in a parenthesis, is still part
of the poet’s irony, as would seem evident ;
but Casaubon says, “ et hic versus sub
adolescentis persona pronuntiatur. Planior
lectio sit ‘ Quid metuam ’ sed aliter scripti
libri.’' ‘ Patella ' is variously explained.
It seems to mean, as Forcellini, Casaubon,
and others explain it, a small flat dish in
which were placed those parts of the food
that were offered to the Lares, a cereinony
that preceded every principal meal. So
Ovid says (Fast. ii. 633) :

“ Et libate dapes ut, grati pignus honoris,
Nutriat incinctos missa patella Lares.’'

The ‘patella' is called ‘cultrix foci,'
because it was kept near the fire, or
because its contents were thrown into
it. ¹ Seeura’ is free from care, like
Horace's “securum olus ’' (S. ii. 7. 30).
It means that there was plenty to eat.
A good many MSS. repeat ‘est' after
‘patella’ Ι am surprised that Heinrich
follows them. There is good authority for
its omission.

27. IIoc satim] The contempt of these
words is better shown without a (P).

‘Pulmonem rumpere ventis’ is to puff
himself up. ‘Stemma' is explained in
the note on Juvenal, S. viii. 1, to be the
table of a man's pedigree. This man’s
origin is like that of Maecenas, from an
old Etrurian stock. ‘ Ramum’ means
one of those “lineae discurrentes ad
imagines pictas,'' lines traced here and
there over the ‘tabula capax’ (as Ju-
venal calls it, viii. 6), and joining the
different membcrs of the family 3 “multae
stemmatum flexurae,” as Seneca says.
(See note above referred to.) This man
makes the thousandth branch on his
‘stemma’ ‘Millesime' is put 111 the
vocative to agree with the person ad-
dressed, rather than with ‘ramum,' with
which it properly agrees, as above, S. i.
123, “audaci quicumque afflate Cratino‚”
and 111 J uv. vi. 27 7, “quae scripta et quas
lecture tabellas? where see notes. As to
‘trabea' see Juv. viii. 2593 x. 35. The
man is supposed to be especially respectful
to a censor in his family tree, to whom the
poet is not so respectful.

30. Ad populum phalerae] “Carry
your ‘phalerae' to the people‚ they may
adinire them ; I know you inside and
out.” ‘Phalerae' were decorations ivon
by his military ancestors. (Juv. xvi. 60,
n.) ‘Discincti’ is ‘loose,' as Horace,
“Discinctus aut perdam nepos '³ (Epod.
i. 34). Persius calls his profligate Natta.
Horace has a niggard of that name (S. i.
6. 124). But it is used there and here as
representing a man of good family. Ju-
venal (viii. 95) has a governor Natta.
L. Murena, whom Cicero defended, had
a stepson, L. Pinarius Natta, of high dis-
tinction. See Pro Murena, c. 35, Long’s
note.
