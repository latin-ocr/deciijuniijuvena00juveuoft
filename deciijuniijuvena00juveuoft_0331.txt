many pictures of this sort, for the first ex-
pedient in danger was to lighten the ship,
asin St. Paul's voyage. Jahn [and Rib-
beck] have ‘ discriminis audi Et,' ἄιε. ; and
also‘ejusdem pars dira.' The other edi-
tors have a stop at ‘ ejusdem) As it is, Ι
think there is something wrong in the

“ then the
hold was full of water, and when the waves
were tossing up first this side and then that
of the ship, a crazy trec, and the skill of
the old pilot could not help her, he began
to settle with the winds by tossing over the
cargo.'’ The words ‘ arboris incertae ' have
given a great deal of trouble, and various
conjectural alterations have been suggested.
Jahn has adopted ‘arbori ' from Lachmann.
Heinrich proposes ‘ marmoris incerti.5 I
think the common reading may stand, ‘ ar-
boris’ being used in apposition with ‘ pup-
pis? He is abusing the ship, which he calls
‘dolatum lignum’ below, as we might call it
a. log. 1 know no other way of explaining
the text. Cramer, who like some others
takes ‘arboris' for the mast, would read
‘incerto,' and explains it ‘ from the crazy
state of the mast,' quoting such places as
Tac. Ann. iii. 54: ‘⁶ incerta maris.'’ But
this is not to the point. ‘Incerto ' is the
reading however of several MSS. [and
of Ribbeck} ‘ J actus ’ is explained on
iii. 125 : “ nusquam minor est jactura
clientis.” ‘ Decidere ’ is the legal term
for coming to ter-ms with an opponent.

See among other places Cic. in Verr. ii. 1.
48, Long’s note. The fablc that follows

about the beaver is as old as Aesop, and
was believed by the ancientS. It is often
alluded to. ‘Adeo intelligit ' is ‘ he so fully
understands ' (S. xi. 131). Heinrich thinks
this verse an interpolation : if so, ‘ cupiens '
belongs to Catullus. But I think it gc-
nume.

39. teneris quoque Maecenatibus] See
S. i. 66, n.: “ Multum referens de Maece-
nate supino.” This name it appears was
long a proverb. He threw overboard his
purple clothes and others made of fine
Spanish wool, from sheep which he says
were coloured by the quality of the rich
grass, the fine water of the Baetis, with its
hidden virtues, and the air of the country
where they were bred, which was the mo-
dern Andalusia, called Baetica from the
river Baetis (the Guadalquivir), by which
and its tributaries it was watered. This
valley has from the earliest times been the
richest in Spain, and was famous for its
breed os sheep. Martial addressing a. toga
sent him by a friend, asks (viii. 28) :

“An Tartessiacus stabuli nutritor Iberi
Baetis in Hesperia te quoque lavit ove ?'’

He often mentions them elsewhere. Virgil's
conceit about the golden age is that the
wool will bc dyed by the grass that feeds
the sheep (Ecl. 4. 42, sqq.) :

“Nec varios discet mentiri lana colores ς
Ipse sed in pratis aries jam suave rubenti
Murice, jam croceo mutabit vellera luto 3
Sponte sua sandix pascentes vestiet ag-

nos.''
