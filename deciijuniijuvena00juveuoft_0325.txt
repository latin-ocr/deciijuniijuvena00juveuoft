Sed nunc dilatis averte negotia curis

Et gratam requiem dona tibi, quando licebit

Humida suspectis referens multicia rugis
Vexatasque comas et vultum auremque calentem.

Greeks. The latter were made of ivory
(above, v. 131, n.) or wood, and corre-
sponded to the Greek κῦβοι. ‘Alea’ was
used generally for all games of chance. See
S. i. 88, n.: “alea quando Hos animos.’'

his dear friend M. Sebastiani in condemning

ever all this may 1)0.” Τ1115 15 a way of
coming to the chief ostensible purpose.
He says it is a holiday, and he must put
away every anxious thought: they will
not say 3 word about usurcrs 1101· of the
suspicions conduct of his wife who goes
out at dawn and comes back late at night,
creating grave suspicion by her gown
being wet and tumbled, and her face
flushed, and hair disordered, and ears red.
When a man 0311 write thus to his friend,
whether in joke or earnaet, society must
be in a bad way. ‘Tacito' means he is
not to come with suspicions and anger
which 110 keeps 10 himself, As to ‘mul-
ticia’ see S. ii. 66, n. ‘Rugae’ is used
by Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 8) as opposed to
‘sinus‚' and both together express the
plaiting of drapery or a woman's dress,
‘sinus’ being the depressione between

the ‘rugae.’ Τ110 climax of all griefs
Juvenal makes the ingratitude of friends.

193. Interea Megalesiacae] On this
subject see note on S. ii. 111: “Hic
turpis Cybeles ;’' and vi. 69: “atque a
plebiis longe Megalesia.” He calls the
gamos those of the Megalesian napkin,
because a napkin was dropped by the
praetor who presided as a. signal for the
beginning of each race or game. Before
‘colunt' ‘cives’ must be understood.
Some take ‘spectacula' for ‘spectatores‚’
as the subject. It is so used 111 S. viii.
205, but not here. The Megalesian games
were not celebrated in the Circus before
the time of the empire. They consisted
in the earlier times 'of theatrical repre-
sentations, and were presided over by the
curule aedile. Under the empire this
duty was performed by one of the prae-
tors, who, it appears from this place,
went in processioa aud presided iu state
as at the Ludi Circenses (500 S. x. 36. n.).
The praetor is called ‘ praeda caballorum,'
Gronovius (Obs. iv. 24) supposeS, because
he had to spend so much money in pro-
viding horses for the gaines. The praetor
is at once in the position of triumpher
and prisoner, such as those who triumphed
led iu their procession. He is one “qui
bona donavit praesepibus ’' (i. 59), though
in 3 different way. Most MSS. have
‘praedm’ but there is no meaning in
that. Ruperti thinks Gronovius’ idea far-
