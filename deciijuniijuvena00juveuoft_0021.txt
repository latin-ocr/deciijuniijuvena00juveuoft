LIFF, OF JUVENA L. xv

that the emperor in a ‹lcspatch addressed to hini with the nrinv, wrote
these words, “et te Philomela promovit'' (alluding to his own epigram ),
and that, learning from this the anger os the emperor, he died of a
broken beart.

The sixth mcmoir makes Trajan the emperor, Paris being still the
hero of the epigram, and agrees with the fifth about Seotland.

A seventh agrees substantially with the first, except that the emperor
is said to have been Nero.

These seven arc published at the end of Jahn's edition.

It seems clear that not one of these notices is original. They have
come, and that not at first hand probably, from two or three common
stocks, which have been confounded according to the. fancy of the
writer; and whatever amount of truth there may have been in the
originals has been perverted and confused in the later editions, which
show very little evidence of accurate information.

The only authority for J uvenal’s birthplace contained in his poems is
in Sat. iii. 319, where his friend says, “ quoties te Roma tuo refici pro-
perantem reddet Aquino.'' But this only shows that Juvenal was in
the habit of frequenting that town. Persius (S. vi. 7) speaks of the sea
on the Ligurian coast as ‘ meum mare,’ because he was staying there at
the time, but no one now infers from this that he was born on that
coast ⁶. Where Juvenal was born therefore is uncertain ὅ, and the
time of his birth is equally so.

That he wrote as late as the reign of Trajan, who succeeded Nerva
ΑΛ). 98, is certain from the allusion in the first Satire (v. 47), and the
eighth (v. 120) to the crimes and banishment of Marius Priscus, whose
exile took place Aa). 100.

Another proof is that, in Sat. xii. 75, he refers to the inner basin of
the Portus Augusti, constructed by Trajan. [If Juvenal wrote this
Satire, the conclusion from the text is true ; and if he did not, the passage
still proves that this Satire was written after Trajan's port was
constructed.]

In Sat. vi. 502, there is an allusion to the way ladies wore their hair,
which seems to show that this Satire was written in the reign of Trajan,
or early in that of Hadrian (see note).

In v. 407 of the same Satire, Lipsius traces a reference to the reduc-
tion of Armenia to the condition of a Roman province, by the same
emperor, in ΑΛ), 106. This argument however has not much force.

⁵ See Life of Persius.

⁸ There is no reason to suppose the grammarians had more authority for calling him
Aquinas than we have. In Pithoeus’ MS. it is said, “ J uvenalem aliqui Gallum propter
corporis magnitudinem, aliqui Aquinatem dicunt?
