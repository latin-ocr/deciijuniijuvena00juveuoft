147. et saepe emunyeris ;] The MSS. all
have ‘et.' N. Heinsius (ad Claudianum, in
Stil. ii. 327) and Burmann (ad Petron. i. p.
279) propose ‘ut,’ “I mu tired of your
blowing your nose so often.'' The text is,
“ I am tired of you, and, besides, you blow
your nose so often,'' which is bettes, the
blowing of the nose is only an ast er thought.
He must make an excuse, and the most
trifling is enough.

149. Interea calet et regnat] Mean-
while, as long as her beauty lasts, she’s a
hot imperious tyrant.

150. pastores et ovem Canusinam] The
wool of Apulia was the best in Italy. That
of Canusium (Canosa, on the Aufidus,
where Horace got and travellers still get
bad bread, S. i. 5. 91) was famous. Pliny
(H. N. viii. 48) says, “Circa Tarentum
Canusiumque summam nobilitatem habent
(oves).'’ And Martial speaks of a fine
dressed slave as ‘ Canusinatus Syrus ' (ix.
23.‘9); and sending a cloak to a friend, he
says (xiv. 127),

“ Haec tibi turbato Canusina simillima
mulso
Munus erit : gaude: non cito fiet anus.''

The natural colour was dark, as Pliny says,
and that is what Martial means. This
woman, as long as she had her beauty and
her own way, would be content with none
but the finest cloths and the best wine.
Falernian elms are put because the vine
was commonly trained to the elm. The
Falernian wine was not in Juvenal's day
as highly valued as it had been in Ho-
race’s. The Setine and Alban were pre-

which is perhaps better.] She will have
all the slaves bought, whole workhouses
full, and any thing she has not got and

slaves were kept in chains at various em-
liloyniexits, such as grinding corn, cutting
and breaking stoncs, and other country
work, and taken as they were wanted to
work in the fields. There were one or
more ‘ ergastula ’ attached to most estates,
and slaves were sent to them for misbeha-
viour or through the caprice of their mas—
ters. See below, S. viii. 18ος xi. 80; xiv.
24, n. ς and the note (and quotations there
given) on Hor. S. ii. 7. 118, “Accedes
opera agro nona Sabino ;'’ where the Scho-
liast says, “Quasi octo servos Horatius
miserit in ergastula agri Sabini.'’ In the
above chapter Lipsius has a long and in-
teresting dissertation on this subject. It
was only usual to put fifteen slaves into
one ‘ergastulum,’ as Lipsius shows from
Apuleius : “ Quindecim liberi homines po-
pulns est: totidem servi familia, totidem
vineti ergastulum.'’ Suetonius (Vit. Aug.
c. 32) says that in the time of Augustus
hands of armed men used to seize travellers
and hurry them off to these ‘ergastula.'
“ Rapti per agros viatores sine discrimine
liberique servique ergastulis possessorum
supprimebantur ;'' this was one of the
abuses that had grown up in the civil wars
which Augustus put down, ‘ ergastula re-
cognovit.’ There is another passage to
the same effect in the life of Tiberius
(Suetonius, Vit. Tib. c. 8). “Curam ad-
ministravit—repurgandorum tota Italia er-
gastulorum quorum demini in invidiam ve-
nerant, quasi exceptos supprImerent non
solum viatores sed et quos sacramenti
metus (fear of conscription) ad hujusmodi
latebras compulisset.” When the slave
insurrectiou broke out in Italy, Rc. 73,
under Spartacus, the rebels forced the
ergastula, and were joined by the wretched
men who had been shut up in them. The
private ‘ ergastula ' were abolished by Ha-
drian not many years after Juvenal wrote,
but revived and continued to exist to the
latest times of the Einpire. See Long's
note on Cic. pro Cluentio, c. 7.

152. et habet vicinus] Jahn [and Rib-
beck] have ‘ sed‚' from P. and three other
MSS. But it is not wanted. There are
many instances in which ‘et’ and ‘que ’
