D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Avolat et spreti repetit vestigia lecti.
Ornatas paulo ante fores, pendentia linquit
Vela domus et adhuc virides in limine ramos.
Sic crescit numerus 3 sic fiunt octo mariti

Quinque per autumnos: titulo res digna sepulcri.

230

Desperanda tibi salva concordia socru.
Illa docet spoliis nudi gaudere mariti 5
Illa docet missis a corruptore tabellis
Nil rude 1100 simplex rescribere3 decipit illa

Custodes aut aere domat: tunc corpore sano

235

Advocat Archigenen onerosaque pallia jactat.
Abditus interea latet et secretus adulter,
Impatiensque morae pavet et praeputia ducit.
Scilicet exspectas ut tradat mater honestos

226. repetit vestigia lecti] This Lubinus
has rightly explained, “ Per eadem vestigia
eandemque viam per quam maritum dese-
ruerat ad maritum 1·evertitur.’' She re-
traces her steps to the bed she had spurned.
But the expression is unusual. Her caprice
is such that the moment she has married
a husband she leaves him, while the fiowers
and boughs and tapestry are still hanging
about the doors (see above, v. 51, n.), and
after all she comes back to the first.

229. Sic crescit numerus ;] The fre-
quency of divorces under the Empire has
been mentioned above (v. 146). Seneca
asks, “Numquid jam ulla repudio erubescit,
postquam illustres quaedam et nobiles fe-
minae non consulum numero sed maritorum
3111105 51105 computant, et exeunt matri-
monii causa, nubunt repudii ?'' (De Bene-
ficiis, iii. 16.) Juvenal says the woman
ought to have the number of her husbands
engraved on 1101· tomb, which Ruperti says
wasusual. This is not very likely, though
Mar tial says of a woman (ix. 16) :

“Inscripsit tumulo septem celebrata vi-
Serf’fsssssse Chloe: quid pote simpli-
01115. ’

there the joke is that it being meant that
this notorious lady (celebrata) had built
this tomb containing her seven husbands,
she is said ‘ fecisse,’ which might mean that
she had done it, or caused their death.
[‘ Fecit ⁵ or ‘ Fecerunt ' is a common word,
sometimes at the end of a Roman monu-
mental inscription, the name of him or of
them who erected the monument (fecit,

fecerunt) being usually placed at the be-
ginning of the inscription. See Fabretti,
Inscript.]

As a specimen of the interpolations of the
middle ages, it may be mentioned that one
late MS. has after verse 230 another ε “ Si
fierent comites citius quam nuberet uxor.''
The little point os which Achaintre would
remove by ehanging ‘ si ' into ‘ nec‚' which
he says is not bad and very satirical. ‘ Si
fierent’ is a wish. But nobody supposes
the verse to be genuine.

231. Desperanda tihi] He says a hus-
band has no chance as long as his wife’s
mother is alive. She teaches her daughter
to rob her husband, she corrects her love-
letters, bribes the servants who ,are set to
watch her, and teaches her to pretend sever
and send for the doctor as an excuse to
avoid her husband, while a lover is all the
while hidden in the rootn.

236. Advoeat Archigenen] Archigenes
was a celebrated physician of this period, a.
Greek, born in Apamea in Syria. Juvenal
mentions him as the representative of his
profession here, and in two other places
(xiii. 98 ς xiv. 252). The subject of ‘ad-
vocat ³ is not the wife but the mother, who
is said ‘ pallia jactare,' to heap a quantity
of bedclothes on her daughter, pretending
she is very ill. Ruperti makes the mother
the subject. Heinrich the daughter. Τ110
explanation of the Scholiast and of those
who follow him, that a paramour is called

in under the pretence of a doctor, is against
the context.

237. latet et secretus] One MS. of no
particular character has ‘ securus.' All the
