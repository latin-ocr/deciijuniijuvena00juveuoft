SATIRA lv.

Quos operit glacies Maeotica ruptaque tandem
Solibus effundit torpentis ad ostia Ponti,
Desidia tardos et longo frigore pingues

Destinat hoc monstrum cymbae linique magister

Pontifici summo,

Aut emere auderet, quum plena et litora multo

Delatore forent ’.Ρ

Inquisitores agerent cum remig-e nudo,

Non dubitaturi fugitivum dicere piscem

Depastumque diu vivaria Caesaris; inde
Elapsum veterem ad dominum debere reverti.

and explains it as “pars retis laxa quae

goes on to say the fish that was thus caught
(‘haeserat,’ i. e. sinubus) was not smaller
than those which, after being frozen up iu
the Palus Maeotis (Sea ofAzov) all the win-

tides, first at Sinope and then at Byzan-

tium. Tacitus (Anu. xii. 63) puts this
down as one of the chief sources of that
city's wealth3 and Pliny (N. H. ix. 15)
refers to the same at some length. The

43. torpentis ad ,ostia Penta] The Scho-
liast's copy had *ωτι-0111153 011 which au·
thority Julm adopts that word. [Ribbeck
also has ‘ torrentis.'] The Scholiast adds
this note: “Perflueutis‚ currentis; illic
nam rheuma quoddam trahit mare.”

what title he would have preferred. Grau-
gaeus sees a propricty in ‘pontifici sunnuo‚’
because of the pontifieal dinners, which
were proverbial.

48. Delatore] There were informers all
along the coast, who poked into the very
weeds (⁶1nu‹1-rak01·s,’ Giss'ord calls them) for
something to 1011 about, and they would

cognomen 11 as ‘Sura‚' is mentioned bx Sue-
tonius (Domit. c. 13) as one who had been
removed from the senate; and the Scholiast
says that it was Vespasian who did it, and
that 110 became. 11 Stoic in consequence:
also that he got into favour with Domitian,
and pursued the trade of an informer very
actively. Armillatus the Scholiast men-

text shows.
