LIFE OF JUVENAL. xix

would put his birth, at tho earliest, in the third year of Nero, ΑΛ). 56,
and I am inclined to think that this is not. tiu· froin thc date. [Ribbeck
has come to the same conclusion, ‚Iuvenalis Sat. Praefatio] 'sliat he
was familiar with the iniquities of Nero «loos not certainly prove that
he lived in his reign, and according to the above suppositioni he was not
more thau twelve when Nero died, perhaps less. 01· Domitian hc writes
with a contempt and loathing which seem to be the fruit of a personal
acquaintance with his times, and a inemory full of disdain. That he
was of full age in Domitian's reign is certain, since he had fomned an
intimate friendship with Martial before the seventh book of his Epigrams
was published. T hat book was written Aa). 93, and contains two
epigrams, one alluding, and the other addressed, to Juvenal, in terms of
affectionate familiarity. This alone would be sufficient proof that J uvenal
was not exiled by Domitian, at any rate till after the above year, which
was ten years after the death of Paris, and not three years before
Domitiau's. In Martial's twelfth book there is an epigram (18) addressed
to Juvenal at Rome, Martial being at his native place, Bibilis in Spain.
This epigram was written between the years ΑΛ). 100 and 104, not long
after the accession of Trajan, and it supposes Juvenal to be wandering
restlessly about the town and tiring himself with attendance on great
people. 1f‚· therefore, any banishment took place in Domitian’s time,
the cause could not have been that assigned by the Grammarians, and
it must have been of short duration.

Adopting then such data as appear to have any probability in them,
the following may be laid down as a sketch of Juvenal’s life, without
pretending to accnracy, for which there are no materials.

His name was Decius Junius Juvenalis.

He was born possibly at Aquinum, in Latium, about the beginning of
Nero‘s reign, that is soon after A.D. 54, of respectable parents, his
father being a rich libertinus, and he himself therefore ingenuus, Ile
received the usual edueation of a Roman boy and youth, as he says (S.
i. 15):

“ Et nos ergo manum femiae subduximus, ct nos
Consilium dedimus Sullae privatus ut altum
Dormiret.’'

He took the ‘toga virilis’ about the beginning of Vespasian's reign,
A.1). 70, and having, as he says above, learnt rhetoric in the schools, 'he
continued to practise it as a man, not professionally‚ bnt for his own
amusement, through the reign of Vespasian and the greater part of
Domitian’s‚ that is, till the year Aa). 94, in which year or the next he
by some means offended Domitian, and was sent by him into Egypt
with a military command, such as civilians often received during the
EmpIre. In ΑΛ). 96 Domitian was killed and Nerva succeeded him.
