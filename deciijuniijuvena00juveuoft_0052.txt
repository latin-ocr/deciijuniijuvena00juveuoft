2 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

very marble is split with their noisc. 1 too have been to school 3 1 too have learnt to
declaim5 and if paper must be wasted, why should not Ι write too Ρ

V. 19. My reason for following in IIorace’s steps is this-when eunuehs are marrying
wives, and women are exhibiting iu the arena, when 11 barber is challenging with his
wealth all the nobility, and slaves arc clad in purple and ass'eeting their summer rings‚
it is impossible to abstain from satire. who can restrain himself when fat Matho
comes by in his litter, and the great informer after him, the terror of all little in-
formers ; when you are thrust from your rights by wretches who get your inhcritance
by satisfyiug 1111 old womun's lewdness Ρ Is it not enough to make one's blood boil
to see the robber treading on pcople's heels with his crowd of sycophantS‚ while his
ward is left to prostitution ? and Marius going off into exile to enjoy himself wilh
the spoils of his province Ρ What does he care for infamy if 110 keeps his plunder?
Are these not fit themes for the muse of Venusia Ρ that have I to do with the
old hackneyed topies when wretches are found to wink at their wives' intrigues‚ and
take the property of the adulterer which the law will not give to the woman ς when
a spendthrift expects to be promoted to high places for the skill with which he
handles the reins while the great 1111111 lounges with his 1111111011 behind ? Does not
one feel inclined to take out one's tablets in the very street when the forger eomes
lounging along in his open litter, and the great lady meets him who has drugged her
husband's wine and has taught her young neighbours shamelessly to do the same Ρ You
mustbe a bold niisereant if you want to be somebody. Honesty is praised and left to
starve. To crime meu owe all their fine gardens, and houses, and furniture. Who
ean sleep for the incest and adultery that is going 011 Ρ If nature refuses, indignation
draws the pen, though it be but such as mine 01· Cluvienus’.

V. 80. All the passions of 111011 from the deluge to this day are the motley subjects of my
book. then was the harvest of vice more abundant? when did avariee so fill its
bags Ρ then had the die such spirit as now when men play not for the contenis
of their purse but of their ehest :³ Look at the hotness of the encounter ! Ahundred
sestertia lost and the poor shivering slave without a tunie3 is not this something more
than madness? Which of our ancestors ever built such villas, 01· dined by himself
off seven com-ses? Now-a-(lays the poor client has to seramble for a paltry dole
grudgingly and cautiously given, and from this he is elbowed by some great pauper who
must have his share first 5 or else some well-to-do freedman eries, “ I came first, and
must be first served 3 1 11111 rich too, and riches are better than rank.'’ And of course
the claim must be allowed3 the rich slave before the poor magistrate, for though
money has not yet had a temple and altars, her majesty is above all others sacred. But
if our high officers are not above reckoning upon the sportula, what will their
followers do who get all they have from this source Ρ Crowds oflitters come up for t'ne
dole, and all kind of fraud goes on.

V. 127. The first event of this (lay is this sportula : then they sally forth to the forum,
with its statues of heroes, among whom some paltry Arabarch has got himself set up.
In the asternoon they come home ς and at the perch the hungry clients take leave of
their patron and their long-cherished hope of a dinner, and retire to buy their bit
of cabbage, while the great man sits down to the fat of the land and the sea, and eats up
a whole fortune off a single table. Who can endure this beastly selfishness? What a
belly that sits down to a whole boar by itself ! But the penalty follows quiek when
,you go down to bathe with your meat crude upon your stomach—sudden death and
intestacy‚ the gossip of every (linum-table, and the delight of your angry friends.

V. 147. Our sons 01111 add nothing to our vices, which have climbed to the highest point3
so set your 511115, my Muse, and bear down upon the enemy. “ But where is your
taient for such great themes ‘r‘ where are you to get your liberty of speech Ρ Mucius
may have pai-doned his satirist, but mark down a Tigellinus and you will share the
