rude masks, then all classes of spectators
were dressed alike, and the magistrates ap-
peared, like the rest, in a plain white tunic.
Such a theatre Ovid describes as belonging
to the primitive times, long before theatres
were known in any but the Greek towns:

“ Tunc neque marmoreo pendebant vela
theatro

Nec fuerant liquido pulpita rubra croco.

Illic quas tulerant nemorum Palatia frondes

Simpliciter positae 3 scena sine arte fuit.

In gradibus sedit populus de cespite factis,

Qualibet hirsutas fronde tegente co-
mas.'’ (A. A. i. 103, sqq.)

174. tandemque redit ad pulpita] ‘Tan-
dem' means after a long interval. It hap-
pened rarely 3 that is, when the annual feast
came round the same old well-known play
came with it. ‘Pulpitum’ (λογεῖον) was
the front part of the stage, where the act-ors
spoke. ‘Exodia' were merry interludes,
introduced between the ‘Atellanae' See
below, vi. 71: “Urbicus exodio risum movet
Atellanae.’' And Suetonius (Tib.45) speaks
of ‘Atellanicum exodium.³ Livy (vii. 2)
speaks of ‘exodia inserta fabellis‚' referring
to the ‘Atellanae 3' meaning, as is probable,
that after the performance of one of these
plays(as to which see vi. 71,n.) an ‘exodium '
was performed before the next came on (see
Dict. Ant.). The name is derived from
ἐξ ὁδοῦ, ‘out of the way‚’ because they took
different ground from the playS. It is
doubtful whether, as acted in these rustic
theatreS, the ‘exodium' was strictly of the
nature here described. It may have been
acted without the ‘ Atellanae?

175. personae pallentis hiatum] The
masks used in these ‘exodia' were of a
grotesque kind, such as those used by the
Greeks in the satyrio drama, of which a
specimen is preserved in the British Mu-
seum. These masks had the mouth wide
open, representing broad Iaughter or grin-
ning. Speeimens will be found in every
collection of ancient gems. The maske

were painted to suit the character. 'Porcel-
lini refers this passage to the ‘mamimus-‚³
a terrible-looking puppet with a man’s head
and movable jaws with great teeth‚ which
it gnashed at the people. But the mask
was terrible enough for this place.

177. similemque videbis] The MSS. and
editions are divided between the singular
and plural. I prefer the singular.

178. Orchestram et populum :] The form
of a Roman theatrc was much like the
Greek. The scats for the spectators formed
a semicircle‚ and rose by steps from the
floor; the semicircular portion of which
between the seats and the stage was called
the orchestra. Here the chorus performed
their part in the Greek theatres; in the
Roman theatre that space was occupied
with seats for the magistrates and foreign
ambassadors. ‘ Clari velamen honoris,’ the
dress of a noble magistrate, is meant in a
jocular way; for if the aediles at Rome
were reduced so low (see v. 162, n.), those
of the country towns were small enough.
But they were great in their own little
sphere. He says that a white tunic is dress
enough for the great aediles ; and just be-
fore he had said the orchestra and the peo-
ple were dressed alike. Yet Gifford quar-
rels with Dryden for saying that the magis-
trate and “ the country bumpkin'’ both
wore a white tunic, which he says is di-
rectly contrary not only to the intent but
to the words of his author. Dryden is not
always accurate in details but he seldom
inistakes the general meaning.

180. Hie ultra vires habitus nitor ,·]
Horace advises his young friend Lollius
that among other characters detested by
the rich is one “ gloria quem supra vires et
vestit et ungit‚'’ who dresses above his sta-
tion and means (Epp. i. 18. 22). ‘ Habitus’
belongs to the later Latinity, as Heinrich
observes. It corresponds to the Freneh
‘ habit?

181. aliena sumitur arca] This means
men buy dresses they cannot afford by means
