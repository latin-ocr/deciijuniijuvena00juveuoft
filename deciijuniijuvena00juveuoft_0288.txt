87. Sed videant servi,] He says our
slaves must see us do it, that none of them
may be able to say we did not, and give in-
formation under which we shall be dragged
with a rope about our neeks to the praetor.
As to ‘injus rapere‚’ ‘trahere‚' ‘ vocare‚' see
notes on Hor. S. i. 9. 74, 76. In the reign
of Tiberius and afterwards the informa-
tion of slaves against their masters, which
was illegal, was freely received and obtained
by tortura. ἐβασανίζοντο δὲ οὐχὶ οἰκέται
μόνον κατὰ τῶν ἰδίων δεσποτῶν ἀλλὰ καὶ
ἐλεύθεροι καὶ πολῖται (Dion Cass, 57.
19). Nerva put a stop to the practice and
checked informers generally (ib. 68. 1).
The MSS. vary between '‘ astricta ' and
‘obstricta’ ‘ Obstrietus ' is used by Plau-
tus in the same connexion (Amphitr. iii. 2.
72) : ‘¹ Quum ego Amphitruonem collo hinc
obstricto traham.'' Heinrich takes ‘ astricta,'
quoting Tac. Ann. iv. ¹70: “ quantum ob-
ducta veste et adstrictis faucibus niti pote-
rat clamitans.'' The case is not the same.
It was the common way of taking a resist-
ing eulprit before the magistrate to put a
rope round his neck.

88. Hi sermones] What precedes, not
what follows as Britannicus says. What
follows is addressed to the reader, who is
asked if he would like to have all the power
and honour that Sejanus had, to give away
the high curule offices to one, military
eommands to another, and to be the guar-
dian of a tyraut shut up in his solitude with
a pack of astrologers. Moderate honours
any one may wish for, but what of those the
greatness of which is the measure of their
daug-ers? The curule officerS, or those en—
titled to the use of the ‘ sella eurulis,' were
the consuls, censors, praetorS, and curule
aediles. ‘ Summas ' does not mean the con-
sulship iu particular, as Ruperti says: it
applies to all. As to ‘ exercitibus praepo·
nere' see note on S. vii. 88 : ‘⁶ Ille et mili-
tiae multis largitus honorem.'’ Sejanus is
called Tiberius’ tutor, whose business it was

to manage the affairs of his ward (pu-
pillus). Many MSS. and old editors have
‘ sellas ' for ‘ summas‚' and Achaintre2has
it. ‘ Summas' is certainly right, and the
other only a gloss. There is a reading
‘ haberi tantundem‚’ which N. Heinsius
(on Ovid, Trist. i. 8. 44) approves, and
Ruperti as usual says ‘non male.' But, as
Heinrich says, it is not Latin.

93. anyusta Caprearum] P. and some
other MSS„ and the old editions, followed
by Jahn [and Ribbeck] have ‘augusta,'
which Heinrich says is an error of the
copyists. No doubt it is. Capreae is au
island forming a continuation of the pro-
montory of Surrentum and three miles dis·
tant from it. It is about eleven miles iu
circumferenee and precipitous on almost all
sides. One point of it rises 1600 feet above
the sea (see Dict. Geog.). Augustus retired
to this place sometimes, and Tiberius made
it his retreat that he might carry on his de-
baucheries uninterrupted and be free from
danger. The climate Tacitus describes as
very pleasant in summer and winter, and
the prospect over the bay of Naples beauti-
ful (Ann. iv. 67). ‘ Sedentem ’ corresponds
to Tacitus' word, “ Tiberius duodecim vil·
larum nominibus et molibus insederat (Ca-
preis).'’ Here hc abandoned business to
such a degree that he left the provinces
without governors, and to the mercy of
enemies, and neglected to appoint officers
to the army, Suetonius says. “ The horri-
ble practices he resorted to for the purpose
of inflaming and gratifying his lusts, were
such that it is impossible to tell or listen
to them, much more to believe them (vix
ut referri audirive, nedum credi fas sit) ''
(Suet. Tib. c. 44).

94. Cum yreye Chaldaeo ?] Tiberius to-
wards the end of his life was much given
to the astrologers, a pestilent race of im-
postors whom he had before punished and
forbidden the city (vi. 553). Suetonius
says of him, “ circa deos ac religiones neg-v
