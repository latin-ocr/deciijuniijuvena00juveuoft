Martinl has this epigram on one Gellius

(ix. 47) 2

“Gellius aedificat semper: modo limina
Niiiigmf’oribus claves aptat emitque
Nnndebaass’ nunc illas mutat reficitque
fenestras ς
Duru tamen aedificet quidlibet ille fa-
Omnilsfiummos ut dicere possit amico
Unum illud verbum Gellius, Aedifico.''

This is like Horace’s description of caprice z
“Dii-uit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotun-
dis ’³ (Epp. i. 1. 100). In short there were
as many who ruined or hampered their
estates by this tempting folly in Rome as
in this country.

87. Litore Caietae‚] Caieta (Gaeta) was
on the promontory that bounds the gulf of
the same name at the southern extremity
of Latium. It was four miles from For-
miae which now bears the name (Mola di
Gaeta). At Formiae Cicero had a villa,
and between those two places the shore
was covered with houses. There are re-
mains of a palace supposed to have been
that of Antoninus Pius at Gaeta. As to
‘ Tiburis arce ’ and ‘ Praeneste ' see S. iii.

89. Graec-is longeque petitis] The Greek
marbles used by the Romans were from
Hymettus and Pentelicus in Attica, from
Taenarus in Laconia, from Carystus in
Euboea, and from the island of Paros. The
other foreign marbles were chiefly African,
from Syene and from Numidia ; there was
stone also from Synnada in Phrygia.

90. Fortunae atque Herculis aedem,]
There was a very ancient temple of Fortuna
at Praeneste, which Ovid alludes to as
‘⁶ Praenestinae moenia sacra' deae '' (Fast.

vi. 62). It was here that the Praenestinae
Sortes, a famous oracle down to a very late
period, were delivered. The temple was
much beautified by Sulla who, Pliny tells
us (H. N. xxxvi. 25), laid there the first mo-
saic pavement known in Italy. It was ex-
tant in liis time, and a pavement (the Bar-
berini at Rome) has been found there of
very tinished workmanship, which is sup-
posed by some to be Sulla’s, but by others of
later date, the reign of Hadrian, that is not
far from the time when this satire was
written. (Cramer’s Italy, ii. 71.) We
learn from Cicero (de Div. ii. 41) that For-
tuna was represented in this temple suck-
ling the infant Jupiter, and was most
piously worshipped by mothers. One of
the Scholiasts refers to this temple as a
thing of former times. It probably did
not escape the barbarians.

The eathedral of Tivoli is built on the
foundations of the temple of Hercules, who
was worshipped above other gods at Tibur.
For this reason it is often called ‘ Hercu-
leum.’

The enormous buildings erected by Ha-
drian at the foot of the hills of Tibur could
hardly have been built when Juvenal wrote
these verses, or they would probably have
been referred to, for in magnificence they
surpassed any thing in Italy. Their ruins
are the admiration of travellerS.

91. Ut spado vincebat] Posides is men-
tioned by Suetonius (c. 28) as a freedman
of Claudius the emperor, favoured and
afterwards suspected· by him. In the em-
peror's triumph for his conquest of Britain,
he distinguished Posides by the gift of a
‘ hasta pura,’ a spear without a head, which
was a common mark of favour for military
services. Pliny (H. N. xxxi. 2) speaks of
warm baths at Baiae, “ quae Posidianae
vocantur, nomine accepto a Claudii Cae·
saris libert0.’' Where he built his magni-
ficent house does not appear. lt may have
been near his baths. ‘ Capitolia nostra ’ is
here opposed to the temples at Praeneste
and Tibur ; but large temples of Jupiter in
other towns besides the great temple in
Rome were sometimes called Capitolium.
Tiberius, for instance, dedicated a Capito-
lium at Capua (Suetou. Tib. c. 40). The
plural is used (as in x. 65) because of the
