Constabit patri quam filius.
Quintilianus habet saltus ‘f”

Felix et sapiens et nobilis et generosus

Et si perfrixit, cantat bene.

Si volet haec eadem, fies de Consule rhetor.

accept any thing by the smallness of his
offering, “nisi sola a mediocritate munusculi
impetrare posse confiderem ne recusares.”
The man to whom this could be said must
be a rich man, though Pliny was much
richer. By ‘ saltus ’ are meant pasture
landa in the forests on the hills (Cic. Orat.
pro Quintio, c. 6, Long’s note). That Quin-
tilian had many of these may be an exagge-
ration. Pliny the younger was Quintilian’s
pupil, and so were many of the leading men
in politics and literature. He also taught
the two grand-nephews of Domitian (Inst.
1. iv. prooem.)‚ who invested him with the
titleof consul, though he never bore the office.
This is what Juvenal means below, v. 197:
‘⁴ Si Fortuna volet, fies de rhetore Consul.'’
Though he respected Quintilian (see above,
l. e.) 118 rather sneers at him here as a
lucky man, ‘Fortunae filius: an example
‘ novorum fatorum‚' of strange destinies,
and when a man is lucky he is every thing
that is fair and great, like the Stoics’ sage,
“ Si dives qui sapiens est Et sutor bonus
et solus formosus et est rex'’ (Hor. S. i. 3.
124). Quintilian, it appears, received a pen-
sion of 100‚000 sesterces (between 800l.
and 900l.) out of the emperor's treasury.
Suetonius says that Vespasian was the first
who gave an allowance to rhetoricians, and
that the above was the amount: ‘⁶ Primus
e fisco Latinis Graecisque rhetoribus annua
centena constituit ’³ (Vesp. c. 18).

192. lunam subtexit alutae ;] ‘Alata’
111 a ahoe, and ‘ luna ’ was some sort of
ornament of crescent shape sewn on to it to
distinguish the wcarer as a senator. See
note on Hor. S. i. 6. 27: “ nigris medium
impediit crus Pellibus.''

194. Et εἰ perfrixit, cantat bena] And
though he has a cold he recites well.

Though he is hoarse pcople will say his voice
is very fine. ‘Jaculator’ is explained on
vi. 449. Ruperti says if the man is hoarse
he will be commended, “forte ob vocem
muliebrem quae asperior facta auribus gra-
tior est,’' “ perhaps because 118 has a
womau's voice, which becomes rougher

and so 111018 pleasing to the ear ’' by means
of his cold !

197. Si Fortuna volet,] So he speaks
elsewhere of men whom

“ —-—- ex humili magna ad fastigia rerum
Extollit quoties voluit Fortuna joeari.’'

(iii. 39.)

199. Ventidius quid enim? quid Tul-
lius ἶ] 1Υ11111 were Ventidius and Tullius Ρ
were they any thing but the ereatures of
their star and the wonderful power of a
secret destiny? were they any thing but
what their star and some hidden destiny
made them? P. Ventidius Bassus was a.
native of Picenum, and in the Soeial War,
according to one story, being at the time a.
child in arms, he was carried captive with
his mother to Rome, and appeared in the
triumphal procession of Cn. Pompeius Stra-
bo, 13.c. 89. When he grew up he gained
his livelihood by letting out mules and
carriages. He became acquainted with C.
Julius Caesar, who took him into Gaul
and employed him for the remainder of his
carcer in important offices. He rose to be
tribunus plebis, then praetor, then ponti-
fex, and lastly consul, Rc. 43. The people
were indignant at his rise, and A. Gellius,
who gives the above particulars of his life
(Noct. Att. xv. 4), has preserved the fol-
lowing lines, which were stuck up about
the streets :
