Si vocat officium, turba cedente vehetur

Dives et ingenti curret super ora Liburno,

240

Atque obiter leget aut scribet vel dormiet intus,
Namque facit somnum clausa lectica fenestra.
Ante tamen veniet ε 1101)15 properantibus obstat
Unda prior, magno populus premit agmine lumbos

Qui sequitur 3

ferit hic cubito, ferit assere duro

245

Alter, at hie tignum capiti incutit, illc metretam.
Pinguia crura luto, planta mox undique magna
Calcor, et in digito clavus mihi militis haeret.
Nonne vides quanto celebretur sportula fumo?

Centum convivae, sequitur sua. quemque culina.

239. Si meat ‘ffef'm²› ] ‘Officium' is
here used for the man' s attendance on the
great or rich. It appears f10m this pl 100
111(111 75, vi. 477, that the‘ lecticarii' were
commonly troni Liburnia, on the 0’ {st coast
of the H-1d1 1‘1tic and that they w ere 3 tall
athletic set. Jahn, from a misconception ot
the S(holiast’ s note, which Cramer s obser-
v ations might hav 0 conected quotes hnn' 111
support of‘ liburna,' as if they were -a sort
of‘ lectica’ named from the Liburni, for
which ther'e 15 110 authority. One MS. it
appears has‘ liburna‚’ but itis a mistake.
Cramer quotes from Papius' Lexicon “ Li-
burni .· populi accolae Hadriatici maris,
prompti ad movendum,” which he corrects,
no doubt properly, into ‘ad currendum?
‘ Liburno’ is the dative ease, and the con-
struction is not ‘ vehetur (a) Liburno,’ as
Mr. Mayor supposes, but ‘super ora Li-
burno.' It was usual for slaves called ‘ ante-
ambulones' to run before the ‘lectica' to
clear the road 3 they called continually
“ Date locum domino meo‚'' and elbowed
the crowd. Martial sends his freedman to
his friend Candidus, and says he will do to
carry his ‘lectica ’ or to run before it: “ 111
turbam incideris, cunctos umbone repellet”
(iii. 46. 5). The rich, during the empire,
had horsemen (Numidae) and runners (‘ cur-
sores') to go before their carriages (see
Becker's Gallus, Exc. on the Slave Family).
The scene herc described may be seen in
any part of the East every day. As to the
‘ lectica,' see note on i. 64. The ‘ fenestra'
was no more than the opening of the cur-
taius.

212. Namquefaeit somnum]
facere' occurs again below (282) :
num rixa facit.'’

243. Ante {amen veniet :]
he takes the thing so easily,

‘ Somnum
“ Som-

Yet, though
he will get

there before poor people who are bent on
the same errand. The wave before and the
crowd behind are only the throngs ofpeople
in the streets, who are jostled by the rich
man and jostle the poor in their turn. Ru-
perti calls them the crowd in attendance on
the great man's ‘ lectica' but he is mis-
taken. ‘Assere,' therefore, is not the pole
of the litter, as hc says, but any pole that is
being carried along the street. ‘ Metreta,’
which was the name of an Attio vessel con-
taining about nine gallonS, was a jar for oil
or wine, a little larger than 311 ’ amphora. '
Horace' s description of the streets of Rome
in his day will occur to those who are fami-
liar with it (Epp. ii. 2. 72):

‘Festinat calidus mulis gerulisque re-
demptor,

Torquet nunc lapidem, nunc ingens ma-
china tignum,

Tristia robustis luctantur funera plaustris,

Hac rabiosa. fugit canis, hac lutulenta ruit
sus.”

See the note there and on Epp. 1. 6. 51,
“Coget trans pondera dextram Porrige1·e.”

248. clavus mihi militis haeret] The
common soldiers and inferior officers wore
heavy shoes, ‘ caligae‚’ studded with hob-
113115, which explains the expression in xvi.

· “ offendere tot caligam, tot Millia cla-
iorum. '² See below, v. 321.

249. quanto celebretur sportula fumeis]
‘How the crowded sportula smokesss ‘Cele-
br xre’ is ‘to crowd? It contains the
same root (creb- ) 35 ’0101)οΥ3 (See Long
on Cic. 111 V errem, ii. 2. 66.) In respect to
the‘ spmtulass see note on i. 95. From
this scene it appears that the viands 11 ere
carried away in the afternoon, as stated in
1. 127. They are called ‘ convivae ’ ironi-
cally; they ought to be the great man's
