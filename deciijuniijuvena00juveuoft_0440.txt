390 A. PERSII FLACCI

V. 24. Think you to pluck his beard because his lightning spares you and your
house P What: is the price you pay sor the god’s ears Ρ Nothing but greasy
entrails? See the old superstitious grandinother or aunt takes up the baby from
its cradle, with spittle charius the Evil Eye away, then prays her hopeful may be
rich some day, a son-in-law for kings‚ the girls all mad for him, and roses growing
wheresoe'er 110 treads. Grant not their prayers‚ Ο Jove, though they come all in
white to offer them.

V. 41. You ask for health and strength ; well, be it so 3 but your gross seeding will
not let the gods be kind.

V. 44. You think to make 3 fortune by your sacrifices, and pray Mercurius to increase
your flocks. How 0311 110 while you waste so many in the flames? Yet the man
goes on hoping, thinking to win by entrails and meal-cakes—‘now are my lands—
now are my flocks increasing-—now—now,’ till the last coin is left to sigh forlorn at
the bottom of the chest.

V. 52. If I should bring you presents chased in gold, how you would sweat with joy!
Therefore you gild 1110 statues of the gods and those who send good dreams above
the rest.

V. 59. Gold has driven out 1110 old-fashioned earthenware. Ye grovelling spirits! why
bring our tastes into the temples‚ 311(1 judge the gods by this vile flesh of curs? ’Tis
this adulterates plain olive oil with casia, dyes the white wool with purple, and scrapes
the pearl from out its 511011, and beats the gold from its native stoue. The flesh is
wrong, bnt yet it gets enjoyment from its wrong : but what’s 1110 1150 01“ gold in sacred
things Ρ ΝΟ more than maidens’ dolls offered to Venus. Let us bring that which
riehes cannot offer, just and religious heartS, holy and honest, and then Ι care not if
1 offer grain.

HUNC, 1113011110, diem numera meliore lapillo,
Qui tibi labentes apponit candidus annos5
Funde merum Genio. Non tu prece poscis emaci

1. Hune, Macrine, diem] One Scholiast
calls Macrinus by the gentilician name

in his references to Horace, quotes for
‘apponit’ C. ii. 5. 13, “Currit enim ferox

Plotius. Another says he was a learned
man and a pupil of Servilius, whose in-
struction Persius also received according
to the writer of his life. No more is
known of Macrinus than this. As to
‘meliore lapillo' the Scholiast quotes
Horace (C. i. 36. 10, 311(1 11010), “ Cressa
ne careat pulcra dies nota.’' This use of
‘ candidus ' to express that which is 011001·-
1“111 311(1 fair is sufficiently common. (See
Forcellini.) The Greeks used λευκὸς in
the same way. On their birthdays the
Romans sacrificed to their Genius. It
was on the eve of his birthday that Horace
wrote to Lamia,

eras Genium mero
Curabis et porco bimestri
Cum famulis operum solutis.'’

(0. iii. 17. 14.)

As to the Roman Genius. see note on Hor.
Epp. i. 7. 94. The Scholiast, who is large

 

Aetas, et illi quos tibi dempserit Apponet
annos.'' Persius means that each suc-

ceeding birthday adds a year to his friend's Α

life.

3. Non ta prece poscis emaci] ‘Emaci’
is explained by v. 29 below, “qua tu mer-
cede Deorum Emeris auriculas.²' He says
his friend does not ask with mercenary
prayer for that which he must take the
gods aside to trust them with. ‘ Seductis
divis ³ does not require explanation. The
ideas of the ancients in respect to secret
prayer are explained on Horace, Epp. i. 16.
59. That passage Persius no doubt had
in mind. Horace’s ‘ Labra movet metuens
audiri ' is repeated in ‘ murmurque humil-
esque susurros‚' ‘sub lingua immurmurat?
‘ Bona pars 'js an expression Horace uses
repeatedly. ‘Acerra’ is a box of frank-
ineense (λιβάνωτις). Τ110 derivation is

uncertain (Hor. C. iii. 8. 2, “Quid velint -.
flores et acerra thuris '’). The MSS. vary '
