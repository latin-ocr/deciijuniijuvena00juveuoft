190 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 163. “ But we all did the same when we were young.'’ Yes; but we’ve left it off.
Such faults should be cut ofl' with our first heard. Childreu may be exeused ς but he
is old enough for the warS. Send him to foreign parte, O Caesar, but seek your legate
in the eating-house : you’ll find him there with cut-throats, 5011015, 1111ον05, runaway
slaves and executioners and drunken priests and undertakers, all pot-follows together.
What would you do with a slave such as this? Of course you'd send him to the fields.
But you excuse yoursclv'OS‚ ye Trojau-born. Brutus may do what would disgrace a
cobbler.

V. 183. Bad though this be, yet worse remains behind. His money spent, Damasippus
goes upon the stage, and Lentulus too exerts himself and acts Laureolus not badly,
deserving‚ as 1 think, a real cross. The people are to blame to sit and see patrician
bufl'ooneries. What price they 5011 their lives at matters not. No tyrant forces
them, and yet they gladly sell themselves to the Praetor for his shows. And even if
the choice were that or death, which should they choose? Does any one fear death
so much that he should act with Thymele and Corinthus P But noble mimes are not
astonishing while a musieian is our emperor. After all this, what shall we have but
shows? This too (loth shame the town 3 Gracchus with face uncovered casts his
net, and failing flies the arena round in sight os all the theatre. We know him by
his tunic and his cap. More shame it is than any wound for him who's set to fight
a priest.

V. 211. Were but the people free, who but would choose a Seneca before a Nero?
The death of many parricides was due to him. His crime was like Orestes’, but it
differed in the cause. One bid by gods avenged his father's murder, but he slew
not his sister or his wife: 110 poisoned no relations, never acted, never wrote a
Trojan War. What greater crime had Galba, Vindex, and Verginius to punish?
What crime so great did Nero in all his tyranny? These are the practices of a
noble prince, who loved to sing in foreign theatres and earn the parsley crown from
Greeks. Hang up your dresses and your masks and harp before the statues of your
ancestors.

V. 230. Catilina and Cethegus were high-born, and yet they would have fired the city,
like savageS, fit to be punished with the shirt of pitch. But our consul was awake3
a new man and ignoble guarded the town and all the neighbourhood, and got more
fame in peace than all Octavius won at Actium or Philippi. Rome was then free,
and called our Cicero his eountry's Father. His townsman too followed the plough
for hire, and bore the stiek in the ranks. But he stood single-handed, and withstood
the Cimbri and delivered Rome, and when the fight was over he was crowned
before his eolleague. The Decii were plebeians, yet were their lives offering
enough for all the host3 they were worth more than all the men they saved. A
slave's 5011 wore the crown of Romulus, and was our last good king. The consul’s
sons would have betrayed the city, a slave betrayed their purpose: he worthy to be
wept by matrons, they deserved to die, the first condemned by righteous laws.

V. 269. You’d better be Thersites’ son aud like Achilles, than like Thersites and
Achilles’ son. But go as far back as you will, you still come to the ‘asylum‚ and
whosoe'er was founder of your line a shepherd must have been or something
worse.
