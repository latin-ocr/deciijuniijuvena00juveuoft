SATIRA XIII. 201

force of the most weighty sentiments is broken hy an ostentation of nrt, unseasonnble
learning, and frigid dechunntiou, particularly in those parts which speuk ofthe multitude
of criminals every duy produces (v. 23, sqq.), the multitude of gods (v. 110, sqq), the pro-
digies to which honesty is likcncd (v. 62, sqq), nnd the doctrine of the philosophers
(V. 120, sqq.). The render will judge for himself whether there is any thing frigid in
these passages, or more ιιι-11601111 than every composition of the kind must be. 110 says
v. 120. sqq. is an unplcnsnnt repetition of v. 19, sqq„ and v. 126, sqq. of v. 23, sqq.; that
the order of the argument is interrupted, as sor instance hy the story of Glaucus
(v. 199—008), which is denicd in my note; and hy the soliloquy, which occurred to
the writer after he had described the sliamelessness of a perjurer, but which his critic
thinks he should have reserved for a later place, mistaking the course of the argument
altogether, though it may be admitted that there is no “ostentation of nrt '' in the
arrangement of the poem, which as it professes to be a letter to a friend, and not
‘¹ frigid ‹le‹·lmnation.” is not unnatural. He also charges the satire with repetition, and
it may be allowed that there is a summai-y of the argument in the first few lines which
is asterwards amplified in its several parts. I suppose Juvenal thought it would be as
well to state his doctrine and enlurge upon it afterwards. Others will think so too.
He has delivered a discourse which the world have never ceased to admire, and of which,
111 spite of the blemishes he thinks he has found, Ruperti says it is “ Satira egregia ct
plena salis sententiarumque gravissimarum.'’

From v. 17 it is commonlyinferred that the poem was written in Hadrian’s reign, about
,1.11. 119.

ARG UMENT.

Bad acts displcase the doerS. conscience convicts them though the praetor's urn 110
false. All your friends feel with y0u; yon are not so poor that you should sink with
such a loss ; besides the case is common, one out of fortunezs heap. Put off excessive
grief, the sorrow of a man should not blaze up too high, the pain should not be greater
than the wound. A trifle, a mere serap of ill you scaree can bear, and all your entrails
burn because a friend will not give up a deposit, and you a man of sixty ! Has not
expericnce taught you Ρ Wisdom is great, mistress of fortune: those we count happy
too whom life has taught to bear the yoke of life.

V. 23. No day so holy but it puts forth thieves and liars. The good are rare, not
more than gates of Thebes or mouths of Nile. 11Ῑο live in the ninth age, an age so
bad no metal is so base that it should give its name. And yet we call upon the faith
of gods and men as loudly as the elients of Faesidius when he pleads.

V. 33. Say, art thou in thy second ehildhood that thou knowest not the charms of other
people’s money, or how they laugh at your simplicity, expecting any man should
not forswear himself or think that fanes and altars have their gods P The natives in
the goldeh age thought so, before the skies were filled so full of gods and hell so full of
victims. Then was dishonesty a prodigy. ’Twas a great crime if youth rose not to
age, yea children to their seniors by sour years. But now if friends should not deny
a trust but pay it back entire, it is more wonderful than all the prodigies that ever
were.

V. 71. Complain that you've been impiously cheated of ten sestertia! What if I tell
of one who's lost two hundred, and another more than 110 can cram into his chest Ρ

Δ ”ris easy to despise the witness of the godS, if human there be none. See with what
voice aud face the man denies it. He swears by all the gods and goddesses, their
bows, spears, tridente, all the armoury of heaven, yea, he will boil his son and eat him
pickled, if he be a. father.
