SATIRA IV.

Pigebat Numidas Albana nudus arena,
Quis enim jam non intelligat artes

Venator.

Patricius? Quis priscum illud miratur acumen,
Brute, tuum? Facile est barbato imponere regi.
Nec melior vultu quamvis ignobilis ibat

Rubrius, offensae veteris reus atque tacendae,

Et tamen improbior satiram scribente cinaedo.
Montani quoque venter adest, abdomine tardus,
Et matutino sudans Crispinus amomo
Quantum vix redolent duo funcra ,- saevior illo

bears are mentioned by Herodotus (ii. 67;
iv. 191), Strabo (xvii. p. 828), Virgil (Aen.
V. 37), Martial (i. 105); and Pliny (H. N.
viii. 36) says, “Annalibus notatum est M.
Pisone M. Messalla Coss. ad xiv. Kal.
Octobres Domitium Aenobarbum Aedilem
curulem ursosNumidicos eentum et totidem
venatores Aethiopas in Circo dedisse.” On
which Pliny adds, that he does not under-
stand why Numidiam bears should be spo-
ken of, as Africa does not produce bears.
Lipsius (Electorum, ii. 4) has a chapter in
defenoe of Pliny, who he says must have
known where the bears came from that
were imported in great numbers into Rome.
Lipsius supposes all manner of beasts were
called ¹ ursi? and that Juvenal means lions,
which Servius supposes may be Virgil’s
meaning. As to ‘Albana arena,' see note
on v. 94.

101. artes Patricius ἓ] The various arts
the Patriciaus had recourse to to save them-
selves. Glabrio’s was that of degra‹ling
himself into a ‘venator‚' which Juvenal
compares with the crastiness of L. J unius
Brutus, who, Livy says, allowed himself
to be supposed a fool, that he might the
better watch for his opportunity of deliver-
ing his country (i. 561. This triek, J uve-
nal says, might pass with Tarquinius Su-
perbus, a king of the old days when they
wore beai-tls, but was not likely to impose
upon modern tyrants. ‘Barbato regi' is
like Horace's ‘intonsi Catonis? (C. ii. 15.
11, and note.)

105. Rubrium] Some take this person
for Rubrius Gallus, who was sent by Nero
against Galba and deserted him (Dion
Cass. 63. 27), and suppose that this was
his ‘ancient offence,' and that Nero is the
satire-writer mentioned in the next line,
because he wrote a poem on one Clodius
Pollio (“ Clodium Pollionem praetorium vi-
rum in quem est poema Neronis quod in-
scribitur Luscio,'·' Suetonius, vit. Domit. i.),
and another ou Afranius Quintianus (Tac.

Anu. xv. 49). Heinrich is ofthis opinion.
The Scholiast says (according to a probable
emendation of his text) that Rubrius se-
duced Titus' daughter, and he was afraid
her uncle would punish him sor his crime.
Gesner takes ‘ improbior satiram‚’ dxc. for a
proverb ,· if so it was probably taken from
Nero. By ‘nec melior vultu quamvis ig-
nobilis’ he means that Rubrius did not
look happier than Acilius, though he was
not ‘nobilis,’ and so far less exposed to the
tyrant’s malice. ‘ 1mprobior,' Heinrich
says, means ‘more abusive.' It implies
also that he had no shame. Juvenal means
that though he was under the stigma of a
crime that could not be spoken os, he was
as forward in abusing others as the man
who living filthily himself wrote satires on
his neighbours. ‘Improbus' has a great
variety of meanings. See Hor.C. iii.24.62‚n.

107. Illontani quoque venter] This is
like ‘Crispi senectus,’ above, v. 81. Curtius
Montanus, a senator, is repeatcdly men-
tioned by Tacitus. He was exiled by Nero
on a charge of libelliug him. He may be
the man hcre spoken of and below, v. 131
and xi. 32. As to Crispinus, see v. 1 of
this Satire. He perfumed himself in the
morning, a vulgar thing to do, and smelt
as strong as two funerals. A corpse was
commonly smeared with ointment‚ as Per-
sius describes one carried out “alto Com-
positus lecto crassisque lutatus amomis'’ (S.
iii. 101). Burning censers also were car-
ried in the procession, and perfumes of all
sorts and flowers were thrown upon the
funeral pile. Statius, describing a fune-
ral, says :—

“—— omne illic. stipatum examine longo
Ver Arabum Cilicumque fluit, floresque
hiddi-›iiiiique arsura seges, praereptaque
Thtspgphlgsslaesffiniqm simul Phariique li-

quores, ἃς. (Silv. v. 1. 210.)
