to the common stock of poetry, all of which
is 1111 offering to the Muses, 111111 the poets

C. iii. 1. 3, “ Musarum sacerdosfl ‘Carmen'
may mean his volume, in which sense it is
understood by many in Horace, Epod. xiv.
7, “olim promissum carmcn,'' or more pro-
bably his poeti-y in general. So Heinrich
takes it. But 500 Introduction.

8. Quis expedivi! psillaco suum χαῖρε,]
He asks who taught the pari-ot or the
magpie to speak Ρ And he ausu-ers it. was
hunger, and this he means to imply is the
reason why so many parrots 111111 magpies
take to poetry. So Horace says of himself
¹‘ paupertas impulit audax Ut versus face-
rem ” (Epp. ii. 2. 51). It seems their way
of teaching the bird to speak was to starve
it. ‘Expedire' is here to make easy, as
‘impedire’ is to make difficult. So it is
equivalent to ‘docere' in the next line.
‘ Suum χαῖρε’ means that the word was a
common oue for parrots, who are frequently
taught to say ‘ how d’ye do ’ with us, or
‘ how are you P’ The Roman women were
very fond of parrots, which were brought
from India. Ovid wrote a very pretty
elegy on the death of Corinna’s parrot
(Amor. ii. 6). He says (23, sq.) :

“Non fuit in terris vocum simulantior 11105,
Reddebas blaeso tam bene verba sono.'’

Jahn says “ Psittacus suum, i.e. peregri-
num χαῖρε sonabat, ut solebant tunc
Romani Graecis formulis uti, pica indigena
vernaculo sermone loquitur.'' An Indiam
bird could not be said to speak Greek as
his own language3 and I see no such oppo-
sitiou between the foreign and vernacular
asJahn supposes. After this verse in some
of the old editions there is found another
which is also in a few Mss„ “Cor-vos
quis olim concavum salutare‚'’ which Ca-
saubon calls “barbarum et ridiculum ver-
sum.” Lubinus wastes a good deal of
comment upon it.

11. artifex sequi vocem] This is the
same Greek construction as in S. i. 70,
‘⁸ 1100 ponere lucum artificeS,” and i. 59,

‘⁴ auriculas imitari mobilis albas.’' The
construction is extremely common in the
odes ofHoraee. I have collected a number
of instances on C. i. 1. 18, “indocilis pau-
periem pati.’'

12. Quod si dolosi Spes refidserit num-
mi,] He does not stop to explain what he
111011115, but goes on, 115 if he had said “want
drives men to write verseS‚’' but if a ray of
hope beams forth that they are going to
get money by them, straightway you
would think om· “crow poets aud poetic
pies” (as Holyday translates it) were
pouring Pegasus’ nectar from their tongue.
He means they write for money, and it'
they suddenly see a chance of getting it,
they becmne excited, and begin spoutiug
away as if their stuff was Muses’ nectar.
The money is called ‘dolosus’ I suppose
because it cheats them into believing them-
selves somebody, or it may be taken as a
general ep1thet. There is a. note ou ‘can-
tare ’ on Juv. S. i. 3. As to Pegaseius 500
note on v. 4. The word is Ionic in its
formation. The reading of most MSS.
and of Casaubon is ‘Pegaseium melos,’
which 110 defends though it is against the
metre. ‘Nectar' is the reading of the
Scholiast, who says “in aliis est melos.’'
Barthius (Adv.xxiv. 17) shows that Pindar
and Theocritus speak of the Muses’ nectar,
which proves nothing. But some MSS„
and two of the best, have ‘nectar,’ and
there is no doubt Ι think of ‘melos ’ being
a gloss, the original of which was probably
‘meh' ‘Cantare nectar ' is not ‘mere
jargon' as Giti'ord says, but is as intelli-
gible as ‘speaking honey‚’ or many like
expressions which use has made tawdry,
and which suit the ancient languages bet-
ter than our own. The MSS. are in favour
of the form ‘poetridas,’ and the form is
analogous to αὐλητρίς, the feminine of αὐ-
λητής. Casaubon though he allows this
form adopts ‘poetrias,’ which is the ordi-
nary Greek word, ποιητρία. ‘Poetidas’ is
another reading, of which and ‘ poetridas’
Burmann (on ovid, Heroid. xv. 183) says
they are “ignota veteribus vocabula neque
