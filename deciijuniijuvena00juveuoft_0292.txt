Quem pater ardentis massae fuligine lippus

D. J UNII J UVENALIS

130

A carbone et forcipibus gladiosque parante

Incude et luteo Vulcano ad rhetora misit.
Bellorum exuviae, truncis affixa tropacis

Lorica et fracta de casside buccula pendens

Et curtum temone jug-um victaeque triremis

135

Aplustre et summo tristis captivus in arcu
Humanis majora bonis creduntur: ad hoc sc
Romanus Graiusque ac barbarus induperator
Erexit ι causas discriminis atque laboris

Inde habuit.
Virtutis.

Tanto major famae sitis est quam
Quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam,

140

Praemia si tollas? Patriam tamen obruit olim
Gloria paucorum et laudis titulique cupido

What Juvenal says here therefore is a mere
flourish and nonsense. He was the owner
of a sword or knife manufactory, which
Juvenal has made the most of. Plutarch
(Dem. c. 4) says Demosthenes had no edu-
cation in boyhood ς and that hc was much
neglected and his patrimony robbed and
squaudered by his guardians is well known.
Demosthenes speaks however of havinggone
to the schools suited to his condition and
learnt what was proper (de Corona 312, 315).

133. truncis affixa tropaeis] His next
case is the vanity of military glory. The
practice of erecting trophies after victories
was very ancient in Greece, and adopted by
the Romans late in the republican times.
They were composed of arms taken from
the enemy and piled up usually on the trunk
of a tree or some low wooden frame (see
Dict. Ant.). ‘ Bucculae ’ are the cheeks of
a helmet which were buttoned under the
chin. ‘Cassis' is properly a helmet of
metal, ‘ galea’ of leather. Some ‘ galeae ’
had vizors which covered the face, as we
have seen in viii. 203. Engravings of the
different kinds are given from genis 111
Dict. Ant„ ‘ Galea.'

135. Et curtum temone jugum] A war
chariot shorn of its pole. ‘ Curtum ’ is not
used elsewhere with a noun after it, but it
is properly a participle. ‘ Aplustre ' is the
curved ornament which most ancient ships
carried on their stern, commonly of a fan
shape. and not unlike the feathers of a Red
Indian chief. Sometimes it was wreathed
with flowers‚ sometimes it carried a flag
or a lantern. The name is taken from the
Greek ἄφλαστον, which is the same thing.
See Dict. Aut.. and also respecting trium-
phal arches at Rome. The five now re-

maining are all of the imperial times. ‘ Hu-
manis majora' corresponds to the Greek
μείζω ἡ κατ’ ἄνθρωπον. AS to the form
‘ induperator’ see note on S. iv. 29. ‘Erex-
it’ and ‘ habuit' have the force of the aorist.

141. virtutem amplectitur ipsam‚] ‘ Vir-
tus ’ is military virtue, ‘ Fortitudo: in
which character she was frequently repre-
sented on medals, sometimes with Honos
or Gloria by her side (see note on Horace,
Carm. See. 57). Mr. Mayor, aster Madvig,
translates this, “ Who does embrace virtue
for its own sake, or would embrace it at
all, if you should take away its rewards ?”
The italies, I imagine, are meant to repre-
sent some grammatical peculiarity ε but the
sentence is not peculiar, but very simple:
“ When you take away the rewards of vir-
tue, who thinks of embracing her without
them ?” Her only charin is gone, and she
has no beauty that men should wish to
embrace her. Ovid says (Ex Ponto ii. 3.

11, sqq.) ε

“N ee facile invenias multis e millibus unum
Virtutem pretium qui putet esse sui.

Ipse decor recti, facti 51 praemia. desint,

Nzn movet, et gratis poenitet esse pro·
um.

(Some read ‘ recte facti.') The idea is the
same here as in Juvenal, Virtue represented
as a beautiful woman whose eharms men
cannot see when she is ‘ simplex munditiis,’
not gilded.

142. Patriam {amen obruit olim] “ Yet
while men will sacrifice nothing to virtue,
to glory they have again and again '’
(Mayor). Juvenal says nothing about sacri-
ficing to virtue or to glory. He says men
will not embrace virtue if you take away
