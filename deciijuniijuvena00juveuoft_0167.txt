“Corripuere sacram effigiem, manibusque
cruentis

Virgineas ausi divae contingere vittas.”

The festival of Ceres (Cerealia) was cele-
brated chiefly by matrons of good character
clothed in white, and Juvenal only means
that there are few who were worthy to
act on those occasions, and few who were
not so impure that their own fathers would
shrink from kissing them.

51. Necte coronam] “ Weu, go if you
will ς bind the garland to your door-postS‚
and hang bunches of flowers before your
gates (as they were wont to do at weddings).
Of course Hiberina (his betrothed) will be
satisfied with one husband. thy, you will
more readily extort this from her, that she
should be satisfled with one eye.’' “Mc
libertina neque uno Contenta Phryne macc-
rat.'' (Hor. Epod. xiv. 15.)

52. tende corymbo-su] A good many
MSS. repeat ‘necte’ But the later editors
have properly rejected the second. ‘ Tende '
has better authority.

55. Magna tamen fama est] “ But there
is a certain lady living on her own estate
who has a mighty reputation (for virtue).
Let her go and live at Gabii or Fidenae as
she does in the country, and then we may
give her some credit.'' Ruperti thinks we
should read ‘ cujusque in ε’ this would
alter the sense and weaken the passage,
which is strengtbened by supposing a parti-
cular instance. Gabii has been mentioned
above on iii. 192. It is associated with
Fidenae (a Sabine town about five miles
from Rome) in S. x. 100. They were
small towns, but no better than their neigh-
1101118, Juvenal thinks, in their morale.

57. et ayello cedo paterna] “And I
grant you, on her own estate‚—and yet who
will take upon himself to say that nothing
has gone on in the hills and the caves P Are
Jove and Mars so old ?'' The meaning is
obvious.

60. Porticibusne tibi monstratur] He
asks if in all the public places where women
resort he can find one worthy of his desires.
The number of colonnades in Rome was
great, and they increased during the
empire. (See Hor. S. i. 4. 134, 11. and Epp.
i. 6. 26, n.) They were the resort of men,
but modest women were not found there.
Ovid (A. A. i. 67, sqq.) mentions several
porticoes abounding in beautiful women of
all sorts, those of Pompeius, Octavia, Livia,
Apollo Palatinus, and others attached to
temples, where assignations were made as
much as any where. According to Ovid,
the theatres were the greatest resort for bad
women, as at one time they were amongst
ourselves. But things are altered now I
believe. He says (v. 89):

“ Sed tu praecipue curvis venare theatris.
Haec loca sunt voto fertiliora tuo.”

{hey swarmed to the theatres like ants or
ees:

“ Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut
ipsae.

Ille locus casti damna pudoris habet.''

‘Cunei ’ are the beuches, or properly the
compartments of scats which, by the ar·
rangement of passages, were so formed as to
resemble a blunt wedge. Τ110 Greeks for
the same reason called them κερκίδες. (See
Smith's Dict. Ant.‚ ‘Theatrum.’)
