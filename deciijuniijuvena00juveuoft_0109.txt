SATIRA ΙΙῘ. 59

Quantum quisque sua nummorum servat iu area

Tantum habet et fidei.

Jures licet et Samothracum
Et nostrorum aras contemnere fulmina pauper

145

Creditur atque deos, dis ignoscentibus ipsis.
Quid, quod materiam praebet causasque jocorum
Omnibus hic idem, si foeda et scissa lacerna,

Si toga sordidula est et rupta calceus alter

Pelle patet ε vel si consuto vulnere erassum

150

Atque reeens linum ostendit non una cicatrix.
Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se

Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.

“ Exeat‚’' inquit,

“ Si pudor est, et de pulvino surgat equestri

Cujus res legi non suflicit, et sedeant hie

155

Lenonum pueri quoeunque in fornice nati ‚
Hic plaudat nitidi praeconis filius inter
Pinnirapi cultos juvenes juvenesque lanistae.”

143. Quantum quisque sua] So the world
says, according to Horace, “ tanti quan-
tum habeas sis '' (S. i. 1. 62, where see
note .

14)4. Jures licet et Samothracum] The
most secret mysteries known to the ancients
were connected with the worship of the
Cabiri, deities of whose naturelittleis known
(see Dict. Myth.). They were worshipped
in more than one island of the Aegean, but
in none so solemnly as in Samofflmee, which
retainsits ancient name, and liesin the north
of that sea. He says though a poor man
swore by the altars of these awful divinities
and those of his country to boot, he would
not be believed, for it would be supposed he
was reckless of the vengeance of the gods,
and that they only smiled at a poor man's
perjury and pardoned it—a very bitter way
of speaking. As to swearing by the altar,
which was common, see note on Hor. Epp.
ii. 1. 16: “Jurandasque tuum per nomen
ponimus aras.’'

147. Quid, quod] See above, v. 86, n.
As to ‘ lacerna,' see S. i. 27, n. ‘ Sordidulus'
is a diminutive that is not found elsewhere.
‘ Calceus’ was a walking shoe, and all these
remarks bear on the appearance of the poor
man out of doors, where he is obliged to
show his poverty among well-dressed up-
stans who sneer at him. Horace speaks of
poverty as ‘magnum opprobrium’ (C. iii.
24. 42), and its mortifications will continue
while the world lasts. Compare xi. 2 :

“ quid enim majore caehinno
Excipitur vulgi quam pauper Apicius ?''

“ Pack hence, and from the cover’d benches

ryden.

This person was called ‘designator’ (Plau-
tus, Poen. Prol. 18, sqq„ quoted on Horace,
Epp. i. 7. 6). The five following lines
must be given to this functionary‚ whom
they do not fit very well; but that does
not much matter.

154. de pulvino surgat equestri] That is,
let him leave the scats of the equites, the
fourteen front rows of the theatro, which
had eushions and were reserved for that
order by a law (A.U.c. 687) proposed by
the tribune L. Roscius Otho. Any one
who had the equestrian census of 400‚000
sesterces might take his place there. Hor.
Epod. iv. 15, n. ε

“ Sedilibusque magnus in primis eques
Othone contempto sedet.''

Here might come then the pander or the
fat auetioneer, or the gladiator and the
trainer. ‘ Praeeones ’ were criers of various
sorts. See note on Hor. S. i. 6. 86: “Si
praeco parvas aut ut fuit ipse coactor Mer-
cedes sequerer.’' The ‘ pinnirnpus ’ was one
of the many sorts of gladiators. He may
be supposed to have been so called because
it was his business to snatch a feather from
the head of his adversary, and this we are
