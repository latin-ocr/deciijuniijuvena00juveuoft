D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Cui totam tremuli frontem Caesonia pulli

Infudit.

Quae non faciet quod Principis uxor?

Ardebant cuncta et fracta compage ruebant,
Non aliter quam si fecisset Juno maritum

Insanum.

Minus ergo nocens crit Agrippinae

Boletus, siquidem unius praecordia pressit

Ille senis tremulumque eaput descendere jussit

In eaelum et longa manantia labra saliva.

Haec poscit ferrum atque ignes, haec potio torquet,

Haec lacerat mixtos Equitum eum sanguine Patres.

Tanti partus equae, tanti una venefica constat!

Nemo vetet, jam jam privignum occidere fas est.

sufferings from this cause, especially through
horrid dreams and want of sleep, were
very severe, and, whatever 1115 madness
proceeded from, the contrast between the
first four months of his reign and his
savage conduct for three years afterwards
can only be aceounted for by insanity, as
Juvenal says below, v. 618, sqq. (Jose-
phus, Ant. Jud. xix. 2, ξ 4.) Caesonia was
murdered by the conspirators who killed
her husband, 24 January, A.D. 41.

616. 0αέ totam tremuli frontem] “For
whom Caesonia mixed the entire forehead
of a shivering foal.³’ See above, v. 133:
‘⁶ Hippomanes carmenque loquar.'' ‘ Hip-
pomanes’ was the name given by the
Greeks to a small black excreseence which
they said appeared on the forehead of
every foal at its birth, and which the dam
tears off with its teeth and swallows, but
if she fails to do so, and any one gets it
off before 1161, and she smells it, she is driven
mad. See Aristotle: καὶ ζητοῦσι τοῦτο
μάλιστα πάντων αἱ περὶ τὰς φαρμακείας.
(Hist. Α11. vi. 18. 223 viii. 24. 11.) Pliny
says nearly in the same words (H. N. viii.
42), “Et sane equis amoris innasci vene-
ficium, hippomanes apellatum, in fronte,
caricae magnitudine, colore nigr03 quod
statim edito partu devorat feta, aut pax·-
tum ad ubera non admittit. Si quis prae-
reptum habeat, olfactu in rabiem id genus
agitur.'' Among the things offered to
the infernal deities before Dido’s sels-
(1( 51111611011 was “nascentis equi de fronte
revulsus Et matri praereptus amor.” (Virg.
Aen. iv. 515.) Vix-gil says that the name
‘ hippomanes' is properly given to a diffe-
rent thing (Georg. iii. 280, sqq.) :

“Hie demum, hippomanes quod vero no-
mine dicunt
Pastores, lentum destillat ab inguine vi-
rus :

Hippomanes, quod saepe malae legere
novercae,

Miscueruntque herbas et non innoxia
verba.'’

620. Illinus erqo nocens] As to the
‘boletus' Agrippina gave to Claudius, see
S. v. 146. Juvenal says her crime was
less than that of Caesonia, for she sent
an emperor mad and set the world on fire,
while the other only sent an old dotard to
heaven with his heels uppermost, that is,
sent him the other way, as the Scholiast
says. Claudius was upwards of seventy-
three when he died. Suetonius describes
him much as Juvenal does, “ Risus indecens,
ira turpior, spumante 116111, humentibus
naribus, praeterea linguae titubantia, ca-
putque cum semper tum in quantulocun-
que actu vel maxime tremulum '' (e. 30).

624. Haeo poseitferrum] “ Τ1115 potion
(of Caesonia's) calls for fire and sword‚ and
toi-tures and tears to pieees patriciam, and
mingles their blood with the blood of
Equites. And that is the eost of a mare's
foal and one charmer ! ’³

627. Oderunt natos depelliee3] “Wives
hate their husbands' bastards; and sup-
pose no one finds fault with that or forbids
it, then straight they count it right to kill
a stepson.'’

629. T'os e90‚p21pilli,] He goes on to
cantion boys who have property against
their own mothers. ‘ Pupillus ³ was a boy
