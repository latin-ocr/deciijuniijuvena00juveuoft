SATI RA XIV.

“Tunicam mihi malo lupini

Si tantum culti solus possederis agri

the reading of P„ which has also ‘lupina '
(meant for ‘lupinae,' the reading of some
MSS. and editions).

161. Mox etiam-fractis aetate]

“ ‘O fortunati mercatores !' gravis annis

Miles ait multo jam fractus membra la-
bore.” (Hor. S. i. 1. 4.)

To soldiers who had servcd their time and
were diseharged (emeriti) a bounty was
given either in money or land. When it
was in land the quantity commonly given
was two ‘jugera' to each man, that is, about
an acre and a quarter. This was believed
to have been the original allotment of land
to citizens by Romulus, and it was retained
in the formation of colonies to a late period.
(See Livy, vi. 36. Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. ii.
p. 48, Engl. Trans.) As to ‘ Molossos ' see
note on S. xii. 108. Pyrrhus he calls ‘ im-
manis' by way of amplifying. His name
never was to the Romans what Hannibal's
became. ‘Tandem—multis—vix’ are all
thrown in to strengthen the case.

165. Nullis visa] Heinrich thinks it
should be ‘ nulli,' which would sound
better. The MSS. have the plural.

166. Curtafidee patriae.] “A breach of
saith on the part of their thankless coun-
try ’' (Mayor). It means rather a scant,
shabby discharge of their promise : like
⁶ curta supellex‚’ ⁶ curto centusse ' in Pei·-
sius (iv. 52 ; v. 191). So Cicero opposcs

“curta sententia '' to “ perfecta atque
plena ’' (de Fin. iv. 14). It makes no ma-
terial difference if we render ‘ curta’ as a
participle, which in fact it is; “nor did
their country appear ungratcful or their
promise curtailed‚'' that is, of its full ae-
complishment. ‘ Gleba’ is used for a farm
commonly 111 1110 law writers. ‘ Saturabat'
is a strong word. They were rewarded to
their hearts' content.

168. unus VernMa, ires domini;] The
slave played with the man’s som, who are
called ‘ domini,' as appears to have been
common. Plautus says of the slave who
carried off his master's son, “ Domo quem
profugiens dominum abstulerat vendidit '’
(Capt. Prol. v. 18). Their grown-up bro-
thers come home from ditching or plough-
ing, and get a late supper after the others
have done (altera coena) of porridge 511101(-
ing hot in great earthen potS. Juvenal
shows great power in these picturcs of rude
life. Pictures they are and very complete.
As to ‘ puls ' see xi. 58. ‘ Horto ' is em-
phatic. What was enough for their entire
subsistence we do not consider enough for
a pleasure gardcn. “ Bene dixit plus nunc
possideri in horto quam tunc in agro ''
(Schol.). Horace complains of the waste
of useful land upon pleasure grounds and
flower gardens, “ Jam pauca aratro jugera
regiae Moles relinquent '’ (C. ii. 15).
