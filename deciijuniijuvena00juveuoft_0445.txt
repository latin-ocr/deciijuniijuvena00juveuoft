SATIRA ΙΙ.

:395

O curvae in terras animae et caelestium inanes!
Quid juvat hoc, templis nostros immittere moreS,
Et bona Dis ex hae scelerata ducere pulpa ⁸?

Haec sibi corrupto casiam dissolvit olivo,

Haec Calabrum coxit vitiato murice vellus,

s· 5

Haec baccam conchae rasisse, et stringere venas
Ferventis massae crudo dc pulvere jussit.

Peccat. ct haec, peccat ς vitio tamen utitur.

At vos

Dicite, Pontifices, in sacro quid facit aurum?

Nempe hoc qnod Veneri donatae a virgine pupae.

Quin damus id superis de magna quod dare lance

“ Et quis tunc hominum contemptor numi-
nis ? aut quis
Simpuvium ridere Numae nigrumque
catinum
Et Vaticano fragiles de monte patellas
Ausus erat ?’'

He has also (S. xi. 109), “ Ponebant igitur
Tusco farrata catino.'' The Vesta] worship
was maintained in the old form with the
rude vessels of earthenware. ‘ Impulit '
means, ‘ has pushed asidc,' or something of
that sort.

63. Et bona Dis esc hae] He asks‚
‘ What satisfaction is this (why should we
do it Ρ), to introduce our habits into the
temples, and to derive our notioris of what
is acceptable to the gods from this profli-
gate flesh of ours?' For ‘hoc ’ (v. 62)
most MSS. and the older editors have
‘hos’ to agree with ‘mores.' But with
‘ex hac pulpa' in the next line, ‘hos
mores' would be weak, and ‘hoc’ goes
naturally with ‘juvat‚' as in i. 112. Hor.
S. i. 1. 77 z

“ Formidare malos fures, incendia, servos,
Ne te compilent fugientes, hoc juvat Ρ ”

‘Pulpa’ is the lean part of the flesh ;
‘caro’ includes all but the bones. Our
use of the words ‘ carnaL' ‘ flesh‚’ &c., as
expraesing the corruptions of man, is de-
rived from the Hebrew, through which, and
not through the Greek or Latin language,
the word passed into the New Testament.
“ My Spirit shall not always strive with
man, for that he also is ssesh,'' was the
language that gave warning of the delugc.
(Gen. vi. 3.) ‘Pulpa' may have come
aster Persius to be more common in this
sense. Three centuries afterwards Auso-
nius wrote (Epp. iv. 93),

“ Nec fas est mihi regio magistro
Plebeiam numeros docere pulpam ;”

but this is not exactly the same. ¹ Pulpa '
here means vicious desii-08, the φρόνημα
σαρκὸς of theology.

64. Haec sibi corrupto]
(pulpa) which adulterates for its own in-
dulgence (sibi) the olive oil with oil of
casia, which was added to give it a spic-y
flavour ς as virgil 5:158, Georg. ii. 465:

It is this

“Alba neque Assyrio fucatur lana venen0‚
Nec casia liquidi corrumpitur usus olivi.”

It is this (he goes on) which dyes the fine
wool of Calabria (principnlly from the pas-
tures of Tarentum, “dulce pellitis ovibus
Galaesi Flumen,'' Hor. Carni. ii. 6.10) with
purple ς it is this teaches us to serape the
pearl from its shell, and to tear the veins
of molten ore from the native earth (the
qnartz in which it is embedded). The ore
he means is that of gold. We have no
word corresponding to ‘ stringere ' here. It
is commonly used of that which is grasped
by the hand. The praeterperfccts ‘dissol-
vit‚’ ‘ coxit‚’ ‘jussit ' have the meaning of
the aorist.

68. Peccat et haee, peccat ;] ‘ The flesh
too errs, it errs3 but yet makes profit of its
fault.’ But he goes on to ask, what is the
good of gold in sacred things and places ,⁹
about as much as dolls offered by girls to
Venus—a common practice after chssdhood,
as gladiators hung up in temples their arms,
and workmen their tools and so forth, when
they had no further need of them. Most
MsS. have ‘sanem’ which Jahn adopts.
I think with the other MSS. and editors
that ‘ sacro ' is the right word to express
a sacred ceremony or place, and both are
involved here, as the context shows.
