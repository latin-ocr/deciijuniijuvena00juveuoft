Nutrit et inventa per devia rura lacerta ;

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

75

Illi eadem sumptis quaerunt animalia pinnis,
Vultur jumento et canibus crucibusque relictis
Ad fetus properat partemque cadaveris affert.
Hic est ergo cibus magni quoque vulturis et se

Pascentis, propria quum jam facit arbore nidos.

Sed leporem aut capream famulae J ovis et generosae
In saltu venantur aves ς 111118 praeda cubili

Ponitur : inde autem, quum se matura levabit
Progenies stimulante fame, festinat ad illam

Quam primum praedam rupto gustaverat ovo.

were held in such esteem for destroying
snakes that it was a capital offence to kill
them. One MS. 1135 ‘ nidos ² for ‘ pullos,’
on which Ruperti (V. L.) has 0118 of 1115
notes: he thinks Schrader is right in sup-
posing that ‘ pullos' has crept 111 from a
gloss, and yet (says he) you may suspect
that ‘ nidos ¹ was interpolated by a learned
hand from v. 143: “ ipse loquaci Gaudebit
nido.'’

77. crucibusque relictis] Lipsius (de
Cruce, ii. 13) quotes Horace (Epp. i. 16.
48); “Non hominem occidi. Nonpasces
111 cruce corvos 3³³ and Prudentius (Hymn.
xi. περὶ στεφάνου) z ‘⁴ Crux illum tollat in
auras Viventesque oculos offerat alitibus :''
and from the Acts of the Max-tyrs this sen-
tence 011 three Christians : “ Claudius, Aste-
rius, Neon, cruci affigantur et corpora eo-
rum avibus laceranda relinquantur.'’ Apu-
leius (de Asino l. vi. fin.) speaks of “pati-
buli cruciatum cum canes et vultures 111-
tima protrahunt viscera.” Poor wretches
dying by inches were probably watched for
days by these ravenous birds, who never
attack a body while the life is in it.

79. Hie est eryo cibus] ‘Ergo' is ‘for
this reason,' because the vulture is so fed
when young, when it grows to full size it
seeks the same food; but the eagles seek
prey in the woods, and their young 01185
learn to do the same. The first three
stanzas of Hor. C. iv. 4. 1, “ Qualem minis-
trum fulminis alitem—Egit amor dapis at-
que puguae,’' will occur to the reader.
‘ Ponitur’ is used in some sort as it is com-
monly used for serving up food or putting·
it before the guests (see xi. 109, n.). ‘ Se
matura levabit' is like Horace’s “Olim
juventas et patrius vigor Nido laborum pro-
pulit inscium '' (1. 8.), Grangaeus reminds

us that vultures do not build their nests in
trees but in rocks. Gifford too observes
that “the eagle is scarcely more delicate in
the choice of his food than the vulture‚'’
and that it is a vulgar prejudice to suppose
he will not touch carrion. ‘ Et ’ eouples
‘ generosae aves ’ with ‘ famulae J ovis!
Only the eagle is meant. P. has preserved
the true reading ‘ hinc ' (82) against that of
most MSS. and old editions, ‘ tunc.’

83. quum se matura levabit] P. has
‘levaret,' a few ‘ levarit,' which Jahn has
taken, with Pithoeus and Ruperti. Her·
mann deserts them for ‘ levabit‚’ comparing
vi. 660, “ 51 praegustabit Atrides.” [Rib-
beck has ‘ levavit.'] The future is used
with ‘ si ’ or ‘ cum ' when a future event is
spoken of on which another event depends.
See note on Horace, Epp. i. 7. 10: “ Quod 51
bruma nives Albanis illinet agris, Ad mare
descendet vates tuus.'’

86. Aede-'ficator erat Cetronius,] ‘Aedi-
ficator' is used for one who is too much
given to building, as Horace uses ‘amator ³
for one who is given to lust : “ Invidus, ira· ι
cundus, iners, vinosus, amator '³ (Epp. i. 1.
38). F orcellini gives examples from Cor-
nelius Nepos (vit. Attici, c. 13), “ nemo
illo fuit minus emax, minus aedificator,”
and Columella (i. 4), “eleganter aedificet
agricola, nec sit tamen aedificator.” The
Scholiast's note is “cupidus fabricae,'’ 3
word only niet with 111 the late writers for
a building. The Romans suffered from the
passion for building. See above i. 94,
“ Quis totidem erexit villas 3²³ x. 225,
“ Percurram citius quot villas possideat
nunc Quo tondente,’' ἄιε. Horace often
alludes to this, as in C. ii. 18. 20, sq.; iii. 1.
33, sqq.; 24. 3, sq. Epp. i. 1. 83, where he
is speaking of the rich man’s caprices:
