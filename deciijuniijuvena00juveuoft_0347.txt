SATIRA XIII.

Nec puer Ili-acu& formosa nec Herculis uxor
Ad cyathos, et jam siccato nectare tergens

Brachia Vulcanus Liparaea nigra taberna.

Prandebat sibi quisque deus, nec turba deorum
Talis ut est hodie, contentaque sidera paucis
Numinibus miserum urgebant Atlanta minori

sented as the son of Tros, or of Ilus
the son of Tros Either way Troas was
his native country, and he was carried
off, according to the common account,
from the Trojan Ida (Hor. C. iii. 20:
“aquosa Raptus ab Ida ’‘). He is said to
have succeeded Hebe as cup-bearer of the
gods. She was a daughter of Jupiter and
Juno, and became the wife of Hercules.
‘Ad cyathos' is the ordinary way of ex-
praesing this office. See note on Hor. C.
i. 292 ‘⁸ Puer quis ex aula capillis Ad cya-
thum statuetur unctis.”

44. etjam siccato nectare] Bentley on
Horace, Epod. xvi. 6 and 8, changes ‘ qne’
into ‘ve’ in a like case with this where
‘nec’ goes before. He does not allow
that ‘et' can follow ‘nec' and carry on
the negation, on which account Ruperti
would here have ‘aut ’ or ‘nee’ for ‘et.'
But Heinrich quotes Ovid, Met. x. 92:
“Nec tiliae molles nec fagus et innuba
laurus;'’ and below, S. xv. 121: “Qua
nec terribiles Cimbri nec Britones unquam
Sauromataeque truces ;’' where however
some MSS. read ‘ ve‚’ and Ruperti adopts
it. But there is no variation in the MSS.
in v. 185 of this satire, “dulcique senex
vicinus Hymetto.” In the places of Ho-
race which Bentley corrects the MSS. are
unanimous, and there is no reason to adopt
his rule. Juvenal groups Hebe and Vul-
can together, and they make a picturasque
contrast. He comes in reeking from his
work. She is at her task on Olympus,
and hands him a cup to refresh him, which
he first drains and then wipes off the
sweat from his black arms. All this Ju-
venal says was after the simple days of
Saturnus. I do not see any great diffi-
culty about the words which Ruperti
says are “explicatu difficillima,’' and
Heinecke (Animadv. 103) can beat nothing
out of them to satisfy him; “Ipse nihil
quod satisfaciat extundere potui.'’ But
he justly ridiculos Ruperti’s ‘tendens,'
which he proposes for ‘tergenS,’ supposing
Vulcan to hold out the cup to some other
god, because Homer makes him act as
cup-bearer on one occasion (Il.i. 597). It

Nondum aliquis sortitus triste profundi

was not very civil of him, Heinecko
thinks, to empty the cup first. But Ru-
perti gets rid of this objection by chaugiug
‘ siccato' into ‘libata’ Heinrich, who
takes the sense as I do, thinks Juvenal
had in mind Homer’s line, σπόγγῳ δ’
ἀμφὶ πρόσωπα καὶ ἄμφω χεῖρ’ ἀπομόργνυ
(ΙΙ. xviii. 414). He was cleaning himself
when Thetis visited him iu his shop, as to
which see S. i. 8, n.: “Aeoliis vicinum
rupibus antrum Vulcani.'' The Scholiast
here is unintelligible. Cramer agrees with
Heinrich.

46. Prandebat sibi quisque deus‚] ‘Each
god dined by himself! He says ‘ prande-
bat-³ because the ‘ prandium ’ (which we
call luncheon) was a plain meal. Gifford
says “his satire is directly levelled at the
frequent apotheoses of the Caesars.” There
is no allusion to them. Juvenal is clearly
ridiculing the polytheism of the poets and
the gigantic system of vice sanctioned by
divine example.

47. Talis uc est hodie‚]
valent to ‘ tanta?
less common where only quantity and not
quality is expressed. Quality may be in-
ferred here, but is not expressed or meant
by ‘ talis! ‘ Talis ut est ' shows the con-
nexion between ‘ ut' and the relative ‘qui‚’
from which ‘qualis‚' the natural com-
panion of ‘talis‚' is derived. The older
form of ‘ ut ’ is ‘ cut ' or ‘ quut!

48. miserum urgebant Atlanta] The
Atlas of the ancients was confined to that
part of the great mountain range of North
Africa which bounded Mauretania on the
south. The poet's idea of the skies rest·
ing upon Atlas is stated in prose by the
geographer Pomponius Mela (de Situ
Orbis iii. 10), who says of it “caelum et
sidera non tangere modo vertice scd susti·
nere quoque dietus est.” See Vix-gil (Aen.
iv. 482), “Axem humero torquet stellis
ardentibus aptum,''quoted by the Scholiast-

49. triste profundi Imperium] Before
‘ aliquis' must be supplied ‘exstiterat' or
‘ erat.’ ¹ Profundi ' is the sea, if we would
avoid tautology. So the Scholiast takes
it. Mr. Mayor says it is the infernal
