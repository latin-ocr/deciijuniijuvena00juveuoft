142. majorque videtur] This is what
Horace says ι

“ Quid quod usque proximos
Revellis agri terminos et ultra
Limites clientium

Salis avarus ?'’ (C. ii. 18. 23.)

O si angulus 1110

Proximus accedat qui nunc denormat agel-

He says if he wants a field and the owner
will not let him have it at any price, he will
send his lean hungry cattle on to his ground
with the young corn just springing, and
they will soon clear it of every blade: and
he adds it is hardly possible to say how
many fields have changed hands by such
mischief. It seems scarcely credible‚ but
Juvenal writes as if 110 knew what he was
saying. The common reading is ‘mittun-
tur.' Jahn, Hermann, [and Ribbeck]
from 1³5 have the future. The common
practice is better expressed by the present.

149. In ventres erbetum] Again P. pre-
serves the true reading. The common word
is ‘habeant.’

150. Dicere via: possis] Heinrich thinks
these two verses heavy, and probably a later
addition to the text. It would be hard to
say why any body should have taken the
trouble to add them, or how they should
have occurred to any one but the author.
After ‘ talia ' we must understand ‘ damna,’
or something like it. The ‘injuria ' is
a wrong like that just mentioned.

152. Sed qui Sermones !] “ But what talk
there will be ! what a foul blast will rumour
blow !” “ What harm can she do me Ρ ”
says the other ς “ Ι (10 not value at a bean·

shell the praise of the whole neighbour-
hood if 1 am to be owner of no more than
a miserable little farm.” (That is, if they
will only praise me on those terms.) “ Of
course then (is the rejoinder) you will gain
exemption from the sufferings ofhumanity‚
and have your life prolonged and happier
than you have ever known it, while you
have got as much land under cultivation as
the Romans had in the time of Tatius the
Sabine king ;'' that is, at the time when,
according to the received story, Tatius and
the Sabines were inhabiting the Capitoline
and Quirinal hills, and Romulus the Pala-
tine, and the two peoples joined and be-
came one under their respective kings. The
extent of land possessed by the Romans at
that time, which represents the earliest
period of their history, must have been very
small. The ‘ ager Romanus' at a period
much later did not extend above five miles
from the Pomoerium (the enclosure of the
city) towards the sea, and the Romans had
then no territory on the other side of the
Tiber. J uvenal’s conception probably is
that of the Romans and Sabines living on
the hills they had respectively occupied,
and possessing no more than the land im-
mediately at the foot of them. The Roman
historians are confused upon this point, and
it is one on which very little can be said to
any purpose. The Scholiast says, “Si tan-
tum possides solus quantum Populus Rom.
possedit, Campum Martium.’'

— quam foedae buccina] P. has ‘foede,’
which Jahn [and Ribbeck] have adopted
but Hermann has not. The adverb is out
of place, and it is plainly an error of the
copyist. In the next line the common
reading is ‘quid nocet hoc? ‘Haec’ is
