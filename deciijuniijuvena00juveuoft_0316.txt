D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Hospes ct ipse tamen contingens sanguine caelum,
Alter aquis, alter flammis ad sidera missus.
Fereula nunc audi nullis ornata macellis.

De Tiburtino veniet pinguissimus agro

Haedulus et toto grege mollior, inscius herbae,
Necdum ausus virgas humilis mordere salicti,

Qui plus lactis habet quam sanguinis 3 et montani
Asparagi, posito quos legit villica fuso.

Grandia praeterea tortoque calentia foeno

Ova adsunt ipsis cum matribus et servatae
Parte anni quales fuerant in vitibus uvae:
Signinum Syriumque pirum, de corbibus isdem

carried up to Olympus in a cloud. Tibullus
says of Aeneas :

“Illic sanctus eris cum te veneranda Nu-
111101
Unda deum caelo miserit ingligetemssi
ii. 5. 43.

Heinrich thinks v. 63 spurious. It is
quoted by Servius on Aen. iv. 619.

64. Fereula nunc audi] As to ‘ fercula‚’
courses‚ see i. 94. The different markets‚
‘macella‚’ the fish, vegetable, meat, and
others, were all united long before Juve-
nal's time into one (see above, v. 10). He
says 110 15 1101 going to furnish his eourses
from any of the markets. ‘Ornata' 1105
been objected to; but Horace uses it in
the same way. See next note.

65. De Tiburtino veniet] It appears
from this that Juvenal had an estate near
Tibur. The description which follows is
after the manner of Virgil's Eelogues, and
reminds us of Ofella's entertaimnent of his
guests (Hor. S. ii. 2. 120) :

“·—-——bene erat non piscibus urbe
petitis

Sed pullo atque haedo3 tum pensilis uva

secundas
Et nux ornabat mensas cum duplice

fieu.''

Under the name ‘asparagi’ are included
several herbs besides the one we know
by that name, which is only one of a
tribe called by naturalists ‘asphodeleaef
To the same belong the onion, gai-lie, and
others. This is why the word is usually
in 1110 plural. (S. v. 82.) ‘Villica’ is
the wife of his ‘ villicus,' or head gardener.
See S. iii. 228: “culti villicus horti.''
The eggs were wrapped up warm in the
hay in which they were laid. Grapes

were preserved in various ways with more
or less freshness. Columella describes a
way of hermetically sealing them when
they were just gathered off the tree (xii.
44), and Pliny (H. N. xv. 17) says they
were dipped in ash-water and wrapped in
leaves or in saw-dust 01· shavings: or they
were hung up to dry, from which they
were called ‘pensiles' (see Hor. l. 0.).
Sometimes they were smoked: see note
011 Ηο1. S. ii. 4. 71 :

“ ——Venucula convenit ollis ε
Rectius Albanam fumo duraveris uvam-’³

These would be dry as raisins. Those pre-
served in jars (ollae) would be such 115
Juvenal describes.

73. Siynz'num Syriumque pirmm] Among
numberless other sorts of pears Pliny (H.
N. xv.15) reckons the Syrian, which he says
is the same as the Falernian, only blaek
and next to the (Ji-ustumian, which he places
first of all. Virgil couples these two sorts
(Georg. ii. 83): “Crustumiis Syriisque piris,
gravibusque volemis.'’ It was so juicy
that they called it ‘lactea.' The Signian
1101115, from Signia, were of a reddish
colour, and so were sometimes called ‘tes-
taceas The apples of Picenum were cele-
brated many years before Juvenal wrote.
Horace mentions them twice, and says
they were superior to those from Tibur.
But Juvenal promises that his shall be equal
10 Picenian (Hor. S. ii. 3. 272, and Sat. ii.
4. ¹70: ‘⁶ Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia
succo ³³). Picenum was also celebrated for

its pears, and not less forits olives. See
Martial v. 7 S (quoted below 011 162) :

“ Succurrent tibi nobiles olivae
Piceni modo quas tulere rami.’'

Juvenal says his apples smell as fresh as
