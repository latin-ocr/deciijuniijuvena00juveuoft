nation and would dress more handsomely than common, in haste to meet lwr lover in
the gau-dens orat lsis’ shrine, poor Psecas has to dress her hair, with her own torn,
her tunic too in rngs. her meast exposed. ¹⁴ This cnrl's too high !'' the lash avenges

Another manages the other side: and then the old woman is called in who once was
elever at the crisping pin, but now is sent to mind the spinning. They give their
judgments each in turn, as if her fame or life were now at stako. Such care fon-looks !
so many stories high she builds her head, Andromache before but short behind. What
mn a woman do whom nature made a pygmy ,⁹

V. 508. Her husband all the while she thinks no more of than a neighbour‚ and is no
more, except as she hates his friends and slaves and spends his money. Look at that
huge eunuch priest, how he comes into her room, with solemn talk frightens and
bids her buy off autumn’s ills with a hundred eggs, and give her clothes to him, that
all her fears and dnngers may go with them. She’ll stand in the eold Tiber, crawl along
the Campus if Io bids her. She’ll go to Egypt and fetch holy water to sprinkle Isis'
shrine, thinking she hears the goddess’ self command her (the gods to talk by night
with such as these !). The highest reverence is paid to him who runs about the town
with Anubis’ head, and laughs at the crowds that· beat their breasts. He asks his
grace for each offending dame, and the snake shakes its head. Moved by his tears
and groans Osiris pardons, bribed with a goose and biscuit.

V. 542. Then goes the J ewish hag, the priestess of the grove, the messenger of heaven,
and gets her fec. For a mere trifle Jews will sell yon dreams.

V. 548. 'rhe haruspex from the East promises wealth and lovers, first searching entrails,
hearts of doves, or dogs, or chiekens, sometimes even boys, and then he turns
informer. ⁴

V. 553. Chaldaeans are more trusted still. thate’er the astrologers may say must be
divine. The first of these is he who, banished ost, was fatal with his hireling books to
Galba. His exile was his strength 3 the astrologor’s believed only if he has worked iu
chains, been long in prison, or has been transported and just saved his life. These
your wife consults about her mother's death, but first about your own, and when her
sisters shall be buried, and her uncle3 or if her lover shall survive herself: what
greater boon can gods bestow P

V. 569. But she is not so bad who knows not of herself the influence of the stars, and
timos, and seasons. But shun that woman in whose hand you see thumbed almanacks,
who wants no man's advice, but gives advice herself. She’ll not ‘go abroad with her
husband if the book says no; consults it ere she drives to the first milestone, anoints
her eyes by the horoscope, takes no food when sick but at the 110111· preseribed. Or if
she's poor she goes to the Circus. The rich keep their augur, or they fee the public

0110 ; the humble strumpet goes to the pillars, and there asks if she shall wed the slop-
seller and jilt the victualler.

V. 592. But these bear children, aye, and nurse them too: children are never born on
gilded 110115, but cut off in the womb. Be glad thou wretch and give the draught
thyself, so shalt thou not be father to an Aethiop, nor have an heir whom thou would'st
shun to meet in the early morning.

V. 602. Then the supposititious brats, thejoys and vows of a fond father cheated at the
wells, and priests and nobles got from that foul quarter 1 Fortnne stands there and
smiles, and folds the babies in her bosom, then laughing gives them to great houses and

prepares a private farce for herself: these are the men she loves, and rears as her own
foster children.

V. 610. Here’s a man selling potions to drive husbands prematurely into dotage; which
