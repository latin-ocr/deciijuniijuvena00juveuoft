D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ut spectet ludos conducit Ogulnia vestem,
Conducit comites, sellam, cervical, amicas,
Nutricem, et flavamcui det mandata puellam.

Haec tamen argenti superest quodcunque paterni

355

Levibus athletis ac vasa novissima donat.

Multis res angusta domi est :

sed nulla pudorem

Paupertatis habet, nec se metitur ad illum

Quem dedit haec posuitque modum.
Prospiciunt aliquando viri, frigusque famemque

Tamen utile quid sit
360

Formica tandem quidam expavere magistra.
Prodiga non sentit pereuntem femina censum,
At velut exhausta redivivus pullulet arca
Nummus et e pleno tollatur semper acervo,

Non unquam reputant quanti sibi gaudia constent.

365

Sunt quas eunuchi imbelles ac mollia semper
Oscula delectent et desperatio barbae,

Et quod abortivo non est opus.

Illa voluptas

Summa tamen, quod jam calida matura- juventa

Inguina traduntur medicis, jam pectine nigro.

370

Ergo spectatos ac jussos crescere primum
Testiculos, postquam coeperunt esse bilibres,
Tonsoris damno tantum rapit Heliodorus.
Conspicuus longe cunctisque notabilis intrat

Balnea, nec dubie custodem vitis et horti
Provocat a domina factus spado.

other, the girl who tramps along the pave-
ment or the fine lady in her chair.
‘Atrum silicem ² is the lava pavement. Li-
burnian slaves are spoken of as hearers in
S. iii. 240: “ingenti curret super ora Li-
burno.’' Here we have SyrianS, who may
be any Easterns, for the name is general.
352. Ut spectet ludos] He now comes
to the extravagance of women indulging

’ themselves with fashionable amusements

in a style beyond their means and eon-
dition. The woman he speaks of hires
every thing, even to her dress, to make a
figure in at the play. The extravagant
dressing of the men has been spoken of
before, S. iii. 180: “Hic ultra vires habitus
nitor? As to ‘ sella,’ see i. 64, 11. ‘Cer-
vical’ is a pillow to support the head.
VVomen of fashi'on seldom went out with-
out a train of female slaves and dependants
like their husbands. Hence the ternis
‘deducere,’ ‘reducere' See Hor. S. i. 9.

Dormiat ille

59, 11. See Casaubon 011 Theophrastus,
Char. xxii. The Ogulnii were a plebeian
gens, who became ‘nobiles’ through the
brothers Q. and Cn„ who as tribunes of the
plebs carried a law affecting the number
aud election of pontiffs and augurs in the
year A.U.c. 454, and afterwards became
Curule Aediles. (Livy, x. 6, sqq.) ‘Vasa
novissima ’ is like Pollio's ‘novissimus an-
nulus' (xi. 42), the last he had.

361. Formica tandem] This is the old
fable of the ant laying up stores for the
winter. He says sometimes after long ex-
perience and at the last hour (tandem) the
husbands try to lay by a little against a
rainy day, as we say. But the wives never
consider how much their pleasures are to
eost, and seem to think money grows like
trees, and is better for lopping. Heinrich
thinks v. 362 should come after 364.

363. Ac velut] [P., Jahn, and Ribbeck
have ‘ac velut.’]
