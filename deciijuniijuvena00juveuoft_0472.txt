Marcus dixit, ita est : assigna, Marce, tabellas.

any slave that is set free gets supplied with
corn at the public expense.' When a slave
was given his liberty, he took his master's
praenomen and gentile name. (J uv. S. v,
127, 11.) Ηο became a citizen, and was
made a member of some tribe. Here the
slave is supposed to belong to a person with
the praenomen Publius, and to be enrolled
in the Tribus Velina, which and the
Quirina were the last that were added
to the number of tribes. (Hor. Epp. i.
6. 52, n., “Hic multum in Fabia valet,
ille Velina.”) During the time of the Re-
public libertini were only admitted to the
four city tribes, of which the Velina was not
one, being named from the territory of the
Velinus in the Sabine country. This re-
striction seems to have been removed under
the Empire. (See Long’s article Manu·
missio, Dict. Ant.) ⁶ Emeruit' is a mili-
tary term for a soldier who has served his
time. ‘Velina' is the ablative case, and
it means ‘ Publius cx Velina.' See Long’s
note 011 Cicero, In Verrem Act. i. c. 8, “ Q.
Verrem Romilia.'' that is said about the
‘ far’ is explained on Juv. vii. 174. “ Sum-
mula ne pereat qua vilis tessera veuit Fru-
menti.’' ‘ Scabiosum ’ is ‘ niusty.'

75. Heu steriles z¹e2·i,] Hepities those as
ignorant of the truth, who think that with
one twist a man can be made a citizen.
This refers 10 1110 11101110(1 of manumission
by the Vindicta, which is explained in the
article referred to in the last note. The
slave was brought before the Praetor,
whose lictor laid a rod (festuca) on his
head, and declared him a free man, ‘ex
jure Quiritium.' The master held the slave
till the other part of the ceremony was
fiuishecL and then he turned him once round,
and, after declaring that he gave him 1113
freedmn, 110 removed liis hand, ‘emisit e
manu,' from which the term ‘manumissio '
is taken. See note 011 Horace, S. ii. 7. 76,
“ quem ter vindicta quaterque Imposita
haud unquam misera formidine privet ?’'

76. hie Dama est, non tressis agas-Q]

‘ This is 110 other than Dama, a groom not ·
worth three ases, a blcar-eyed profligate, .

who would lie in the matter of a poor seed
of corn.' ⁴ Dama ³ was a common name
for slaves It is a corruption of Demetrius.
‘ Vappa ' is explained by the Scholiast on

Horace, S. i. 1, 104, where see note. He ι

derives it ‘¹ a vino corrupto et evanido quod

saporem perdidit? ‘ Farrago' is explained ⁸.

on Juvenal, S. i. 86. This groom eheated

his master by robbing 1113 horse of his food z ·'

the common story. [Jahn has ‘vappa
1ippus‚' and the following note: “ Vappa
vocabatur mustum, quod iterum sponte

fervebat, qua calamitate deperit sapor .
(Plin. xiv. 20. 25), 01 0111111110 vinum vilis- ;

3111111111, quale servum decebat, qui immo-
dico ejus usu lippus fact-us est, ut vinum
nimium oculis noeet.’']

79. Illareus Dama] See foregoing notes.
While the freedman took his master's
praenomen and gentile name, he kept
his own name instead of taking the cog-
nomen of his late owner.

‘Exin' ‘ turns ι

out‚' is used as in Horace (A. P. 22), “cur- “

rente rota cur urceus exit ?” and below, v.
130. The groom now becomes a great

man : on his seeurity 110 man can refuse to ,

lend money3 with such a Judex no one
need fear the failure of justice. Marcus
has said, and so it must be: Marcus is
called iu to witness testaments. These are
all marks of a free man. As to ‘ spondere ’
see Dict. Ant„ Art. ObligationeS. The
witnesses to a will had not only to sign their
name but to affix their scal. ‘Tabellas’
seems to mean a will here, and is the usual
word. Jahn treats it as any legal docu-
ment. Cornutus had been manumitted
himself. See Introduction.

82. hoc nobis pilea donant l] See note
on S. iii. 106, “ Hesterni capite induto sub-
iere Quirites.'' This verse Heinrich gives
to the next speaker. It is better taken as
the poet’s sarcasm.
