D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Calceus et grandes magna ad subsellia surae,

Legibus antiquis castrorum et more Camilli

Servato, miles ne vallum litiget extra

Et procul a signis.

Justissima Centurionum

Cognitio est igitur de milite ; nec mihi deerit
Ultio si justae defertur causa querelae.

Tota cohors tamen est inimica, omnesque manipli

Vindicta gravior quam injuria.

Judicia, Cic. Orat. vol. i. p. 46.) Up to a just.'

certain time during the empire ‘injuriae ’
could only be prosecutcd criminally under
the Lex Cornelia de Injuriis, one of the
leges named after the dictator Sulla.
whether the power of procecding by a civil
action, which is implicd in the text, existed
iu J uvenal’s time, is uncertain. If it could
be shown that it did not, this would decide
the question as to the authenticity of the
satire, as Heinrich says (p. 543).

It is usual to describe the ccnturions as
great stoutmen. Horace speaks of “pueri
magnis e centurionibus orti '³ (S. i. 6. 73).
See also Persius, S. iii. 77, V. 139. ‘ Caput
intactum buxo‚' ‘nares pilosae‚’ ‘grandes
alae ' arc spoken of as the strongest recom-
mendation to this office in S. xiv. 194. He
speaks here of great benches to match the
great legs. All is in the rough way.

15. more Camilli] The days of the old
discipline when M. Furius Camillus was
dictator and besieged Veii (Rc. 393). Ru-
perti says he issued an ordcr that 110 soldier
should be prosecuted beyond the camp, but
he does not give his authority.

17. Justissima centurionem] Ruperti
says these are the words of the poct to
himself or of Gallus to the poet, and that·
‘20 sqq. are the words of the soldiers to the
injurcd person, or rather of the poet doing
away with the objection. lt is not s03
nor is there irony, as Gifford and others
say, in the language. Juvenal says the
ccnturions give just judgment against a
soldier, and if a man goes before them with
a good complaint he will get satisfaction.
But he will find the. whole camp set against
him, and 1115 satisfaction will be worse for
him than his wrong. ‘ Igitur' serves to
keep the sentences together. ⁶ Well then
the centurion will give just judgment.’
When he says ‘nec mihi deerit' he puts
himself in the position osan injured civi-
]ian‚ as belom v. 28, “11011 sollicitemus
amicos? ‘ Querelae ’ is the genitive of

Dignum erit ergo

quality, ‘ a cause in which the complaint is
‘Deferre‚’ with or without ‘nomen,'
means to inform against. ‘ Deferre causam'
15 not a legal phrase. ‘Tota cohors’ is
put generally for ‘tota castra' (2). (See
xiv. 197, n.) ⁴ Consensu magno ' is an
ordinary phrase for perfect unanimity.

21. efficiunt curabilis ut sit] ‘ Curabilis'
is the reading of P. and a few MSS„ of the
Scholiast and many old editions, among
others the Editio Princeps Nearly all thc-
MSS. have ‘curabitis' and ‘officiunt‚' after
which is a full stop. ‘ Efficiunt ’ and ‘cu-
rabilis’ are the right words, though the
latter is not found elsewhere. It means
that which wants curing. P. alone of all
the MSS. has ‘et ' after ‘vindictas Hein-
rich omits it with the other MSS„ and I
have no doubt he is right, and that the
absence of ‘ et ³ led the copyists to change
‘ curabilis ³ into ‘ curabitis.' The way of
speaking, ‘gravior curabilis: is Greek: the
usual Latin would be ‘gravius' A like
construction is found in Horace (C. iii. 20.
7), “tibi praeda cedat Major an illi.”
Heinrich's way of taking ‘curabilis ' with
‘ injuria' appears to me very harsh and
unnecessary. The lengtheuing of the short
vowel before the two consonants is common
enough. ‘ Vindicta ’ (which here seems
only to mean satisfaction) and ‘injuria' are
both legal tcrms. The first was the name
given 10 certain actions for compensation
or restitution of rights or satisfaction for
violence, insult, dc, for ‘ injuria' isa wide
term. (See Dict. Ant„ Long’s arts. ‘Vin-
dicta ’ and ‘ Injuria.') [Jahn and Ribbeck
have ‘ et ἕνης-1019]

22. Dignum erit ergo] “It isa proceed-
ing then worthy of the ranting Vagellius
with his stupid hardihood, as long as you
have got two sound legs to provoke so
many shoes, such thousands of hobnails.'’
This is explained above on v. 14. tho
Vagellius was is not known. He was ready
for any job in his line it would seem, and
had no want of boldness of a certain sort.
