Vexit et ad Circum jussas prostare puellas.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ite quibus grata est picta lupa barbara mitra !
Rusticus ille tuus sumit trechedipna, Quirine,
Et ceromatico fert niceteria 00110.

Hic alta Sicyone, ast hic Amydone relicta,

Hie Andro, ille Samo, hic Trallibus aut Alabandis,

Esquilias dictumque petunt a vimine collem,

66. pieta lupa barbara mitra !] ‘Pictus,'
like ποικίλος, means ‘emb1·oidered.' The
women in Eastern Asia do not wear any
thing on their head but a veil to draw over
their face. The ‘ lnitra,' a sort of light
turban, belonged to the women of Syria
and Asia Minor. “ Mitra proprie Lydorum
fuit ’³ is Servius’ note on Aen. ix. 616:
“ Et tunicae manicas et habent redimicula
mitrae: O vere Phrygiae neque enim Phry-
ges-'³ The effeminate Romans took to wear-
ing it. It is always associated with them
or with harlots. Why these persons should
be called by a name which means a she-
wolf is obvious. According to Livy the
story of Romulus and Remus being nursed
by a wolf is founded on their having suckcd
the breasts of a ‘ meretrix.’ Ι agree with
Heinrich, who says ‘ite' means ‘go thither‚’
i. e. to the Circus. Ruperti says ‘in nia-
lam rem.'

67. Rusticus ille inus] See last Satire,
127, n. Here he apostrophizes Romulus as
there he spoke to Mars, though according
to Servius, there quoted, Mars was called
Quirinus when he was in a quiet mood. Of
‘ trechedipna' the Scholiast says they were
Greek shoes (caligulae) worn by parasites
running to dinner. The derivation from
τρέχειν and δεῖπνον 10 obvious enough3
and whatever the things were, the con-
text shows they were Greek. That they
were shoes may be infer-red from the name.
Also a parasite was called τρεχέδειπνος.
Beyond this nothing can be said with cer-
tainty about ‘ trechedipna,’ which is found
nowhere else. ‘ Rusticus' does not here
mean a rustic literally, but the descendants
of rustics 3 and Henninius' supposition,
therefore, that Juvenal is indignant that
even the rustics of Italy should be shod
like (1100110, despising their native shoes, is
not to be regarded, as the next verse might
have told him.

68. Et ceromatico fert niceteria colla]
‘Ceroma’ (κήρωμα) was a preparation of
clay, oil, and wax, with which the Greek
wrestlers were anointed. ‘ Niceteria ' (νικη-
τήρια) 11010 means the prizes of victory
for wrestling, a practice only introduced at

Rome under the empire. The early Ro-
mans despised the Greek gymnastie excr-
cises, and Nero was the first to build 11
public gymnasium or training-school for
wrestlers, &c. Juvenal mentions this as
one of the discreditable Greek innovations.
He uses Greek words designedly.

69. Hie alta Sicyone‚] ‘ These Greeks
come from all parts‚' hc means. One from
Sicyon, which he calls ‘ alta! That part of
Sicyonia which lay on the coast (of the Si-
nus Corinthiacus) was level, and the city of
Sicyon, its capital, was originally on the
plain, about a mile and a half from the shore.
But this was destroyed by Demetrius Po-
liorcetes, and a new town was built by him,
which, according to Strabo (viii. p. 382),
stood on a fortified emiuence. Sicyon was
celebrated for its refinements. Amydon is
introduced as being at the other end of
Greece, 011 the banks of the Axius in Mace-
donia. Homer mentions it in his Cata-
logue, Il. ii. 849. Others, he says, are
islanders, some from Andros, and others
from Samos, the name of which represented
all that was refined and luxurious in the
earlier history of the Asiatic Greeks, but
which was itself much decayed at this
time. Tralles and Alabanda were fiourish-
ing towns on the main land 3 the former in
Lydia, on the right bank of the Maeander ς
the other in Caria, on the river Marsyas.

71. Esquilias dictumque] He chooses to
represent the city by an important part of
it, including the third and fifth Regions,
which comprised the Esquiline and Vimi-

nal hius, and some of the best houses in ·

Rome. Mons Viminalis was supposed to
have been so called from an osier plantation
that grew on the top of it. He says, these
slaves are brought to Rome, to be intro-
duced into great houses, and become so
necessary to them as to be themselves the
heart and virtual masters of those houses.
This he follows up by a description of their
character, quick talents, reckless effrontery,
and great abundance of words, which, con-
sidering the licence the Romans gave their
upper slaves, would naturally lead to the
results he fears.
