Et qui per fraudes patrimonia conduplicare,

Dat libertatem et totas effundit habenas

230

Curricul03 quem si revoces subsistere nescit
Et te contempto rapitur metisque relictis.
Nemo satis credit tantum delinquere quantum
Permittas: adeo indulgent sibi latius ipsi.

Quum dicis juveni stultum qui donet amieo,

235

Qui paupertatem levet attollatque propinqui,

Et spoliare doces et circumscribere et omni

Crimine divitias acquirere, quarum amor in te
Quantus erat patriae Deciorum in pectore, quantum

Dilexit Thebas, si Graecia vera, Menoeceus,

In quorum sulcis legiones dentibus anguis

Cum clipeis nascuntur et horrida bella capessunt
Continuo, tanquam et tubicen surrexerit una ι-α
Ergo ignem cujus scintillas ipse dedisti

either therefore another line has been lost
or this is the work of an interpolator who
forgot to finish the mischief he had begun.
The Ianguage in v. 230, sqq. is taken as is
manifest from the chariot raceS, like that
of virgil quoted by the Scholiast (Georg.
i. fin.) :

“Ut quum carceribus sese effudere quad-
rigae,
Addunt in spatia, et frustra retinacula
tendens
Fertur equis auriga neque audit currus
habenas.”

231. quem si revoces] The antecedent to
‘ quem ’ is easily supplied by substituting
‘juveni' for ‘curricula’ The chariot re-
presents the son, who is the real subject of
the sentence. So immediately below (v.
241) for ‘quorum,' ‘Thebanos' must be
substituted for ¹ Thebas,' which is the same
thing, as ‘ civitas ' is equivaleut sometimes
to ‘ cives,' πόλις to πολῖται, and so forth.
The change of person in ‘revoces' only
makes the sentence more pointed. ‘ Nes-
cit' is used as Horace and others use ‘ nes-
cius :³ “Pelidae stomachum cedere nescii,'’
“ Pelides' wrath who will not yield '' (C. i.
6. 6). Other examples are quoted there.

234. adeo indulgent sibi latius ipsi]
‘Adeo ’ belongs to ‘ indulgent ς’ “ 50 deter-
mined are they to take a wider indul-
gence without asking your leave '³ (ipsi).
“ Adeo plus peccare cupiuut’' (Sehol.).
“ Usque adeo semper plus peccare gau—
dent '' (Lubinus). Mr. Mayor takes it

with ‘ latius? “ So much more unrestrained
liberty do they allow themselves? With
‘stultum' in the next verse we must supply
‘ esse eu1n.’

237. et circumscribere] See x. 2222
“quot circumscripserit Hirrus Pupillos.''
Before ‘quantus' ‘tantus' must be sup-
plied. See note on S. x. 13. As to the
Decii see viii. 254, n. Menoeceus the son
of Creon was said to have sacrificed him·
self when Thebes was besieged by the seven
chiefs. Teiresias the seer prophesied that
if he did so the Thebans would gain the

victory (EuripideS, Phoenissae, v. 913).
J ux enal likes a stroke at Greek history
(see x.174); he therefore goes out of his
way, and having spoken of Thebes he adds
the legend of Cadmus sowing the dragon' s
teeth from which the Thebans sprung, and
says the soldiers whom this sowing pro-
duced fell to fighting straightway as if a
trumpeter had been born with them. From
the earliest times to the present the
trumpet in some shape has been used for
battle signals, in all nations civilized and
uncivilized. Ruperti thinks these verses
are “parum opportuni,” and betray too
much engerness on the poet’s part to ex-
hibit his art and learning. Such learning
certainly must have astonished all Rome.
As to ι-’(]110111111 (241) see note on 231.
The reading of a few MSS„ ‘ssquamm is
an attempta· to iinprove the text.

244. Ergo iynem] A sentence is begu
at ‘ Quum dicis juveni ' (235), and the end
of it is lost sight of. But the subject is
