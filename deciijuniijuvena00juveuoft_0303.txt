Praeterea castum ingenium vultumque modesto

Sanguine ferventem tribuat natura benigna

Larga manu : (quid enim puero conferre potest pl us
Custode et eura natura potentior omni ?)

Non lieet esse viros, nam prodiga corruptoris

Improbitas ipsos audet temptare parentes.

Tanta in muneribus iidueia !

Deformem saeva castravit in aree tyrannus5

on Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 25, “rigidis aequata
Sabinis;'' and C. iii. 6. 37 z

“ Sed rusticorum mascula militum
Proles, Sabellis docta ligonibus
Vei-sare glebas, et severae

Matris ad arbitrium recisos
Portare fustes.”

‘Horrida' is equivalent to ‘rigida,’ ἐπει-ιι]
in these extracts. Livy has “disciplina
tetrica ac tristis veterum Sabinorum, quo
genere nullum quondam incorruptius fuit¹'
i. 18).

( 300. modesto Sanguine ferventem]
“ Hot with modest blood ’' is a good way
of expressing a blush. He says nature is
stronger than any guardian or any watch-
fulness, and she can give no greater safe-
guard to a boy than a chaste disposition
and a modest face. But a handsome boy
is not allowed to grow up a man (which is
explained in v. 307), for his parents will
sell him. The reading of the best MSS.
in 304 is ‘vii-os? Ruperti from some of
inferior rank has ‘vix-is? Jahn has adopted
from his own conjecture ‘ viro ' [and Rib-
beck accepts it].

306. Nullus ephebum]
rowed from the Greek, is a youth just
aster he has taken the ‘ toga virilis ' (ado-
lescens): ‘praetextatus’ is a boy who has
not yet taken it. See notes on S. i. 78,
and ii. 164. ‘ Arce’ is the emperor’s
palace- ‘Rapuit' means ‘ ravished? ‘ Lo-
ripedem ' is explained on ii. 23. ‘ Strumo-
snm' is ‘ scrofulous.’

310. I nunc] This is a favour-ite way of

‘ Ephebus) bor-

Exigit autem

speaking with Juvenal. See vi. 306; x.
166; xii. 57. He says, “Go now and be
proud of your son's beauty, seeing that it
only involves him in the greater danger.'’
1 do not like the punctuation of Ruperti
and Heinrich: “I nunc et juvenis specie
laetare tui! quem Majora exspectant ‹lis-
erimina ,Ψ I agree with Jahn licre. ‘Adul-
ter publicus ' means a paramour at every
bad woman's command, provided she pays
him, as it appears below.

313. nec erit felicior astro Martia]
This is an uncommon construction, but the
meaning is his star will not prove luckier
than that of Mars, who was caught in
adultery with Venus by Vulcan, and en-
tangled in a fine chain net, and so exposed
to the laughter of the gods. Ovid tells
the story, and says it was “ in toto notis-
sima fabulo caelo’' (Met. iv. 189). See
also odyss. viii. 266.

314. Exigit autem . . . ille dolor] The
mischief people get into by meddling with
other rnen's wives is summed up by
Horace, S. i. 2. 41: “ Hic se praecipitem
tecto dedit ,· ille flagellis Ad mortem
caesus,” διο. He ends with saying, ‘¹ De-
prendi miserum est: Fabio vel judice
vincam.’' The punishment by the inser-
tion of a mullet is referred to by Catullus
(xv. 19). See Foreellini. Valerius Maxi-
mus (vi. 1. 13) gives a catalogue of exam-
ples beginning much in Juvenal’s words:
“Sed ut eos quoque qui in vindicanda
pudicitia dolore suo pro publiea lege usi
sunt strictim percurram: Sempronius Musca
C. Gallium deprehensum in adulterio flagellis
cecidit ; C. Memmius L. Octavium similiter
