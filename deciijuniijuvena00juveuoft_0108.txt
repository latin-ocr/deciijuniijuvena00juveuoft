58 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Filius: alter enim quantum in legione tribuni
Accipiunt donat Calvinae vel Catienae,
Ut semel atque iterum super illam palpitet : at tn,

Quum tibi vestiti facies scorti placet, haeres

Et dubitas alta Chionen deducere sella.

Quaestio : “ quot pascit servos? quot possidet agri
J ugera? quam multa magnaque paropside coenat ‘?'’

only a way of saying he was very rich and
could indulge himself as he pleased.

132. quantum in legione tribuni Ac-
cipiunt] It does not appear what the pay of
a tribune 1135, but we may conclude from
this passage that it was not a small sum
compared with prices in these times. In-
deed, the pay was so good that it passed
into a proverb, as Lipsius says (de Mil.
Rom. v. 16), quoting Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 3),
who speaking of costly candelabra from
Aegina says, “nec pudet tribunorum mili-
tarium salariis emere?

133. Calvinae vel Catienae‚] These repre-
sent women of birth. Such a one, related
to Augustus and sister of L. Silanus, is
mentioned by Tacitus (Ann. xii. 4).

135. restiiz'sacies scorti] She in pursuit
of her trade would appear in a toga, ear-
ried about in a chair (S. i. 65, n.), to invite
and be inspected by customers. Or else she
sat in a chair in her house, and those who
came in to admire must pay her well before
she would get down. To invite her from
her sella, whiehever it waS, would be the
same as to consent to her price. Seneca
(de Benef. i. 9) says a man was counted a
barbarian and hated by the women “si
quis conjugem in sella prostare vetuit et
vulgo admissis inspectoribus vehi undique
perspicuam.'’ Chione is a name that is
found repeatedly in Martial.

137. Da testem Romae] He goes on to say
honest poor 111011 are not believed at Rome
on their oath. By the host of the Idaean
divinity, Cybele, he means P. Cornelius
Scipio Nasica, who for his great merits was
chosen by the senate to escort the image
of that goddess, which was brought from
Pessinus to Rome Ass. 550 (see S. ii.
111, n.: Livy, xxix. 143 xxxv. 10). L.
Caecilius Metellus who triumphed during
the first Punic war, who was twice consul,
once magister equitum, dictator, and for

twenty-two years Pontifex Maximus, shortly
as ter he was proinoted to that office rescued
the palladium from the temple of Vesta
when that was 011 fire. He lost his sight on
that occasion (see vi. 265, “ Lepidi caecive
Metelli''). The Romans professed to have
in the temple of Vesta the original Trojan
palladium, brought from Troy by Aeneas.
The oldest tradition made it an image not
of Pallas Athene, but of another damsel of
that name (Pallas), whom the goddess slew.
But this was lost sight of, and the posses-
sion of the image was counted a sufficient
pledge of the help of Minerva and the
safety of Rome.

140. Protinus ad censum,] They direetly
look at the mau's income, not his character,
which is the last question they ask. “ Vir-
tus post nummos ’³ (Hor. Epp. i. 1. 54).

141. quot pascit servos ἲ] The slaves in
some households at this time, if the state-
ments 011 record are to be believed, were
couuted by thousands. There must have
been many masters who had slaves by hun-
dreds in their ‘familia urbana’ and ‘rustica'
together. (On this subject see Becker’s
Gallus, Exc. on the slave family.) Pliny
(H. N. xviii. 6) complains of the extent of

the lands held by single owners, and says it ·

is ruining the cultivation of Italy, and that
the same misehief was extending to the pro-
vinces: “ Verumque confitentibus latifundia
perdidere Italiam ; jam vero et provincias.”
He refers to Virgil's maxim, “Laudato in-
gentia rura, Exiguum colito '' (Georg. ii.
412). The word ‘latifundia ’ seems to have
been invented at this time to express these
large farms. It is not found earlier than
Pliny. Seneca makes great complaints upon
the same subject in a variety of places,
which are referred to by Mr. Mayor. (Senee.
Epp. 88, 89.) ‘ Possidet ' means the owner.

142. paropside] This is one of the many
names the Romans had for their dishes,
