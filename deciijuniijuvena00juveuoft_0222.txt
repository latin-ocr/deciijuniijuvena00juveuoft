Ille et militiae multis largitur honorem,
Semestri vatum digitos circumligat auro.

Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio : tu Camerinos

Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas?

The commentators differ about ‘ intactam?
It has the sanie sense as ‘integram.' It
stands for ‘ new‚’ as Heinrich says. Whe-
ther this means that other poets had not
handled the subject, as he and Bentley
understand it (Bentley, Horace, Epp. ii. 2.
80), or that the play had not yet been in
the aetors' hands, and was unpublished,
may bc doubtful. It is unlikely that this
subject should not have been handled by
any of the Latin poetS, who followed the
Greek tragedians, and I am inclined to
take ‘intactam' as fresh rather in com·
position 'than subject. Bentley quotes
Statius himself in favour of the other
meaning (Silv. iii. 1. 66, sq.) ε

“Assidue moresque viri pacemque novos-
que
Pieridum fiores intactaque carmina dis-
cenS.'’

Juvenal may possibly have taken Statius’
own word ironically, and without much
meaning. It is not easy to decide. Nei-
ther Statius' play nor any other on this
subject has come down to us. Agave is the
furious mother who tore her son Pentheus
to pieces at the revels of Dionysus, as re-
presented in Euripides' play, the Bacchae.
Paris seems to have bought the play out of
charity to the writer. Whether he meant
to exhibit it as the aediles exhibited plays
for the public entertainment at their own
expense, or whether it was a ‘canticum‚'
as the Romans called pieces written ex-
pressly for pantomimic performance, and
Paris intended to act it, Juvenal no doubt
means that he bought it because the poet
wanted the money. ¹ Esurit—nisi vendat‚'
‘he starves if he sells not,' is a familiar
idiom for ‘he would have starved if he
had not sold,' ‘esuriisset nisi vendidisset.'
Jahn has ‘ vendit,' for which he quotes
the authority of P. and three other MSS.
The rest have ‘ vendat,' which is right.
[Ribbeck has ‘ vendit.’]

88. Ille et militiae] He goes on to say,
that Paris used his influence with Domitian
to get advancement for the poets. Ruperti
says “ salse haec dieta.'' It appears to me
to be kindly said and kindly meant towards
Paris, whose conduct is contrasted with
that of the ‘proceres' The military offices

Juvenal says he got confer-red upon poeta
were those of ‘ praefecti' and ‘ tribuni mili-
tares? The number of these ‘tribuni ’ in
each ‘ legio' at the time when Horace held
the office in Brutus’ army was six. This
part of the satire will be sufficiently intelli-
gible with the help of the following re-
marks from Lipsius, De Militia Romana,
l. ii. dial. 9. He says (from Suetonius, c.
38) that Augustus allowed the sons of
senators from the time they assumed the
‘toga virilis ' to wear the broad ‘clavus ’
(or stripe on the tunic); and when they
first entered the army, he not only made
them tribunes, but praefects of the ‘alae ’
(allied troops). From this arose a dis-
tinction of tribunes, some being called
Laticlavii and others Angusticlavii ς those
being of the senatorial order, these of the
equestrian. Both classes were much sought,
and in order to gratify more applicants the
office was made half-yearly (semestri) as
Pliny says (Epp. iv. 4): “ Hunc ego rogo
semestri tribunatu splendidiorem et avun-
culo suo et sibi faciaS.” Lipsius quotes this
passage of Juvenal, who does well to say
‘ semestri auro‚' because the ‘ tribuni' wore
a gold ring ; and confirms his explanation
by the words of the writer of Juvenal’s
life attributed to Suetonius, who speaks of
“paucorum versuum satira non absurde
composita in Paridem pantomimum poet-
amque ejus semestribus militiolis tumen-
tem.’'

This passage is associated with the prin-
cipal event recorded of J uvenal’s life, and
the reader is referred to the memoir at the
beginning of the volume. ’

There is no conjunction between the
two parts of the sentence, and it is not
wanted. ‘ Ille et ' means he does more
for the poets than buy their plays ; he gets
them military honours, he puts gold rings
on their fingers: the one explains the
other. Heinrich would read (but it is not
in his text) ‘ semestris' to agree with
‘militiae,' and ‘ moestis’ instead of ‘multis‚'
comparing ‘moesta paupertas’ above (v.
60). [Ribbeck omits 88, 89.]

90. tu Camerinos Et Bareas] Came-
rinus was the name of a branch of the
patrician gens Sulpicia. It was much dis-
tinguishedin the time of the republic. One
of the Bareae has been mentioned before
