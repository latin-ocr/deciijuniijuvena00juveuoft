Sed vigilat Consul vexillaque vestra coercet.

Hic novus Arpinas, ignobilis et modo Romae

Praesidium attonitis et in omni gente laborat.

nones. ‘ Minores ' is used in this sense
before (S. i. 146). Before the formation of
1110 separate province Gallia Narbonensis,
it appears the Romans gave the inba-
bitants the name ‘Braccati’ (as they called
themselves ‘togati ³) from their wearing,
like nearly all other nations not Greek or
Roman, ‘braccae‚’ ‘breeehes‚’ which has
been mentioned before (ii. 169, n.). See
Pliny, H.N. iii. 4. The Senones were an an-
cient Gallie tribe on the Seine. (See Long’s
11010 011 Caesar, B. G. ii. 2, and Intr. p.
22, and art. ‘ Senones‚’ Diet. Geog.) They
were among the Gauls who invaded Italy
in the time of the Tarquins, according to
Livy (v. 33, 34), and they remained in
Umbria till the Romans destroyed them
all 13.st 283. Juvenal says the conspira-
tors were like descendants of these savages,
who only came to ravage and destroy-

been alluded to above (i. 155), where the
Scholiast says: “Nero maleficos homines
teda et papiro et cera supervestiehat et sic
ad ignem admoveri jubebat ut arderent.''
This is repeated in the Scholium here:
‘⁶ Vestis ex charta facta, pice illita in qua
ignibus poenae addicti ardere solent.” Se-
neca (Epp. xiv.) speaks of “ illam tunicam
alimentis ignium et illitam et intextam.”
The faniiliar name for this seems to have
been ‘ tunica molesta3⁵ Martial uses it (Χ.

(Arpino) was a town of Latium and a 1011-

that had curule 1101101115, and was therefore
‘ novus homo ' and ‘ ignobilis.³ After him
his family became ‘ nobilis.' He was con-
sul Rc. 63, and in that year the conspiracy
of Catilina was formed. Cicero often al-
ludes to his own connexion with the eques-
trian order.

¹ In omni gente laborat ' means ‘ 1ιο cares
for all peoplc.’ ‘Gentes,’ for the people
about Rome, is opposed to the inhabitants
of the city by Horace (C. i. 2. 5): “Ter-
ruit Urbem, Terruit gentesf’ (See below,
xv. 10.) [Ribbeck has ‘monte’ for ‘gen-
te.'

2110. {oya eontulit illi] ‘Toga' is equi-
valent to peace, as is common. ‘Nominis
et tituli' is a common way of speaking,
where a general term is put first and a
particular form of it follows. The title
was ‘pater patriae' (v. 243), respecting
which see note on Horace, C. i. 2. 50:
“Hie ames dici pater atque prineeps.''
Cicero was honoured hy Catulus and Cato
addressing him as ‘parens patriae?
‘And at that time,' Juvenal adds, ‘they
were free.³ He means that afterwards,
when they gave it to Augustus and to
other emperors after him, they were not
free. Ruperti says it means they were
freed from danger, which destroys one of
the chief points of the eontrast Juvenal is
drawing between Cicero and Octavius. By
Leucade 110 means the battle os Actium,
which place was about thirty miles north
of tbe island of Leucas or Leucadia. The
other battle referred to is Philippi, which
was in Thrace, but was included in the
province of Macedonia. ‘Thessaliae cam-
pis ’ therefore is an inaccuracy. The ori-
ginal name of Augustus was C. Octaviu83
but. 110 dropped 11115 at his great unele’s
death, and then be became C. Julius Caesar
Octavianus, to which the title of Augustus
was added Rc. 27. [In v. 241 Ribbeck has
‘ vix Leneade.’]

212. Octavius abstulit] The ‘non' which

‘ Modo ’ but the other day belongs to this clause must be supplied from

(as we say), 110 was only a municipal the preceding.
