Ite igitur, pueri, linguis animisque faventes,
Sertaque delubris et farra imponite cultris

Ac molles ornate focos glebamque virentem.

J am sequar ct, sacro quod praestat rite peracte,
Inde domum repetam, graciles ubi parva coronas
Accipiunt fragili simulacra nitentia cera.

Hic nostrum placabo J ovem Laribusque paternis

Tura dabo, atque omnes violae jactabo colores.

Cuncta nitent ; longos erexit janua ramos
Et matutinis operatur festa lucernis.

Nec suspecta tibi sint haec, Corvine ; Catullus,
Pro cujus reditu tot pono altaria, parvos

Tres habet heredes.

83. linyuz‘s animisque faventes,] To the
ordinary formula, ‘favete linguis,' ‘ani-
mis' was sometimes added, as in Ovid,
Fast. i. 71 :

“Prospera lux oritur, linguis animisque
favete3

Nunc dicenda bono sunt bona verba
die.”

It means to keep both tongue aud thoughts
in a reverential frame, as it is in Sopho-

cles, Oed. Col. 131 z

ἀφώνως, ἀλόγως, τὸ τᾶς

εὐφήμου στόμα φροντίδος

ἱέντες.
The knife as well as the burning flesh of
the victim was sprinkled with ‘mola
salsa’ (above 5, n.). The ‘molles foci'
are the turf altars (v. 2), of which there
were three.

86. et, sacro quod praestat] He says,
after performing the chief sacrifice, that
which has precedence‚ he will go home
and crown his Lares, which it seems to
have been usual to rub with wax and
polish. ‘Fragili' seems to be only what
is called an ‘epitheton ornans.' Some
take Horace’s ‘renidentes Lares’ (Epod.
ii. 66) in this way. The wax may have
brightened them up, but that is not all
Horace means. Horace describes his hum-
ble Phidyle as

“ PaI‘VOS coronantem marino

Rore deos fragilique myrto.”
(C. iii. 23. 15.)

89. Hic nostrumplacabo Jovem] The
Penates of a house included one or more
of the Dii Magni as well as the Lares,
the spirits of their good ancestors. Ju-

piter, J uno, Minerva, and Vesta, one or
all, were most commonly included. As
to the branches see ix. 85. ‘operari’
is commonly used for offering sacrifice,
or the performance of a religious duty.
Here he means his door is doing its duty
with its early morning lamps. On this
subject see note on Persius, v. 180. Ru-
perti says ‘operatur' means ‘operam
dat :¹ “h. e. servi occupati sunt in lu-
cernis ad januam suspendendis et matu-
tino jam tempore accendendis.'' ‘ Opera-
tur' is ‘operam dat,' but with a religious
meaning. Lipsius (Elect. i. 8) proposes
‘operiturss ‘is covered,' which is said to
be in one MS. of R. Stephens. I am sur-
prised ‘oneratur' has never been sug-
gested. I think it would be better than
‘operitur.' But ‘operatur' is the true
word, I have no doubt.

95. Libet exspectare] “1 shall be glad
to see who will expend a sick hen, just
closing its eyeS, on a friend so fruitless as
this.” Cocks or hens were offered to
Aesculapius in particular, but also to the
Lares and other gods (xiii. 233). Pliny
says of them, “ Extis etiam fibrisque haud
aliter quam opimae victimae Diis grati ”
(H. N. x. 21). He says not even a quail
would be sacrificed for the father of a
family. Of quails Pliny says they were
not caten because they were supposed to
seed on poisonous berries, and were held
in contempt because they were subject to
epilepsy. They and the sparrows (S. ix. ’
54, n.) were types of debauched passion,
and were never very well thought of. ‘ Ca-
dere ' is a common word in connexion with
sacrifices. Horace says (C. iii. 18. 5), “Si
tener pleno cadit haedus anno.”
