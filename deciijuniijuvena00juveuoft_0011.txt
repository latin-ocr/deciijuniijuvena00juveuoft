AS in the case of Horace, there has been collated a sufficient num-
ber of good MSS. of Juvenal to supply a satisfactory text without
resorting to conjecture 3 and 1 believe there is authority from MSS.
or scholia for all the readings I have adopted. That MS. to which
most weight is, perhaps deservedly, attached is commonly called
the Codex Budensis, having been originally in the royal library at
Buda, in Hungary. Where it is now, is unknown. It is referred
to in these notes as P„ from Pithoeus (Pithon), on whose collation,
towards the end of the sixteenth century, our knowledge of it
chiefly depends. It had before been used with less care by Valla,
whose edition was first published at Venice a century earlier (1486).

From this MS. copious scholia were published by these editors, γ
and they are referred to generally as ‘ the Scholiast³ in this and
other editions. But they are not all from t-he same hand. They
have been carefully edited by Heinrich and Schopen, and still
more so by Cramer (Hamburg, 1823), who found a MS. at St.
Gallen, in Switzerland, containing the same, or nearly the same
scholia as the MS. of Buda. Cramer assigns the St. Gallen MS.
to the eleventh century, and supposes it to have come from the
same source as the other.

The Codex Budensis is chiefly relied upon by two late editors,
Otto Jahn (Berlin, 1851) and C. F. Hermann (Leipzig, 1854),
who says (Preface, p. 19) that it alone represents the genuine text
of Juvenal, the others being derived from a text “ multiplici veteris
correctoris licentia deformatum.'' Ι look upon this as a rash
