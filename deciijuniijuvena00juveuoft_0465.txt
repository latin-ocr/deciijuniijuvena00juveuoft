lond? Murcus is Judex. who shnll he nsi-uid? Mun-cus has spoken, nnd it must hv
true! Marcus, l pmyyou sign und seul iny will ! This is pure liberty z tln· vnp os
freodom gives us this!

—so long. at least, as Ι keep within the law ?’ Now put asido that nngry look, und
I’ll relieve you of these old wives’ tales. The Praetor could not tvm-h you the
subtle offices of life, and how to use it. As soon shall low slaves play the han-p.
Raeason ἴοι-111115 that any should (10 that which they must spoil in doing ; the lau-s os
man and nature say the same. The ignorant must not iningle niodicines: a plough-
mnn taking to a ship were shamelcss. Say, have you learnt to walk uprightly Ρ 'l'o
know sound from unsound Ρ Το set their true marks upon things, whether to 110
pursued or shunned? And are you moderate in your wishes and your life? kind to
your friends? liberal, but not extravagant P 110 longing eye sor moneys not your
own Ρ WVhen you ean say, ‘ all this is miness be free and wise in Praetor's mnne und
Jove's. But if within you're only what you were, then I retract, you're nought in
reason’s eye ς only put forth your finger and you err 3 folly and right can never dwell
together ς the ditcher cannot dance Bathyllus' Satyr. You free, the servant of so
many masters! Suppose you’re safe from the lash, have γοα 110 lord within to
punish you Ρ

V. 132. See, Avarice wakes you up from sleep and bids you go and trade, bargain, and
lie: fool! never mind though Jove should overhear you. Then off you s'tart till
Self-indulgence bids you pause ε ‘ Madman, where go you Ρ You to eross the scas,
to sit upon n. coil of rope, eat off a bench, and drink red wine of Veii ‘r’ And all to
double the fair interest you're getting on your capital. Indulge γο111501ἲς the
moment that we live is on1·s; you'll soon be turned to dust; for time is flying, death
will soon be here? See your dilemma. Now γοα must serve this master and now
that. And though you once resist you cannot say you're free. The dog may break
his chain, but drags a good part after him.

V. 161. Chaerestratus declares he’ll mend his ways, and wait no longer at a harlot’s
door. ‘Well done, young master‚’ Davus eries. ‘ But do you think she'll be
nnhappy, Davus ?' O foolish boy, she'll beat you with her shoe. Fume not, you talk
fierce now, but when she calls you back you'll go in a moment. It would not be so
had you left her whole and sound.

V. 174. Aye, whole and sound, here is the thing we want ; not in the lictor's rod. Is
that man free, led by ambition open-mouthed, flinging his largess to the people Ρ

V. 179. When the Jews’ feast comes round you mutter prayers and tremble at their
sabbatha. Or a black ghost, or broken egg, or Cybele's great priests, or Isis’
priestess, threatens you with plagues unless you eat a head of garlic thrice in the
morning.

V. 189. Now tell all this to the captains‚ and they’ll laugh and swear these Greeks are
barely worth one as a-piece.
