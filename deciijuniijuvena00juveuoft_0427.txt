rixantis millia turbae.'’ ‘ Fermentmn ’ is
any thing which sermeuts within. Here it
is the poct’s nasty thoughts. See. note on
Juv. iii. 187. The man is made uncon·
sciously to describe the corruption ot* his
own mind by his illnstration. lt was com—
mon to see the wild fig springing from
tombs as mentioned on Juvenal x. 145:
“ Sterilis mala robora fieus.'' Lust, as we
have seen above (v. 12, n.)‚ was supposed
to have its seat in the liver.

26. En pallor seniumque J] For ‘en '
Heinrich reads ‘hine‚'and gives these words
to the speaker in the two preceding verses
There is no authority for ‘ hin(·‚’ and the
words express well the indignation of the
poet. ‘See this is your pale eheek and
your wrinkles : this is what you have
studied for, to be flattered by such people
as these! ‘ Senium ’ is like ‘ canities’
above, v. 9, except that the cause is diffe-
rent. It means the severity of a studious
face. In iii. 85, he says “Hoc est quod
palles ?'' ‘ O mores l’ seems to have been
a common exclamation after Cicero, “O
tempora, Ο mores!’' (ln Verr. ii. 4. 25,
and in Cat. i. 1.) Martial has an epigram
beginning “Dixerat ‘o Mores! o Tem-
pora !’ Tullius olim ’' (ix. 71). Persius
asks is your knowledge so entirely nothing
unless another knows you have it ,⁹ As to
⁴ usque adeo ’ see Juv. xi. 131, n.‚ “adeo
nulla uncia nobis est eboris.'' On ‘scire
tuum ’ see above, v. 9, n.

28. At pulcrum digito monstrari] So
Horace thought.

“Quod monstror digito praetereun-
Roinaniiientliidicen lyrae,
Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum
est.'’ (C. iv. 3. 21, sqq.)

‘Cirrati' are boys with long hair and
cnrls, which they usually wore till they
took the ‘toga virilis? See Juv. xv. 135,
n. ‘Dictata' are boys’ 1essons, so called
because the master commonly dietated

— what the boys had to learn by beart. This
- particularly applied to poetry.

30. Eece inter pocula quaerunt] Hein-
rich makes this, to v. 43, a continuation

Ecce inter poeula quaerunt

of the speech in the preceding verses. But
it is in fact an indirect and sai-castic rcply
to it. The poet goes on to show the worth
ot' such praise as the man thinks so much
of, aud represents a party of fellows over
their cnps discussing what was real
poetry, and a coxeoinb getting up and
drawling and niineing out some trash of
a sentimental sort, which is forthwith
applauded by the company. “ Snrely (he
adds sarcastically) that inan is happy in
his grave ! The turf must lie light upon
his bones after such praise‚ and violets
must spring fron] his ashes.'' ‘Romuli-
dae' is used with contempt like ‘Titos’
above (v. 20). As to ‘laena ² see J uv. iii.
283. It was worn of various fine colours
in and out of the house. Turnebus (Adv.
xxviii. 26) says it was not worn out of
doors. ‘Hyacinthina’ is a dark violet.
The MSS. vary between different forms of
‘hyacinthina' and ‘ianthina.' As this
does not suit the metre, Heinrich believing
it to represent the true reading has
altei ed it to‘ Tyrianthina,’ a mixed colour,
purple and violet. The word is found in
Martial (i. 54). ‘Rancidulum’ is offen-
sive fiom afl'eetation (Juv. vi. 185, n.‚
“nam quid rancidins''). ‘Bulba’ is ap-
plied to ⁴ nare,' but the meaning is ‘ bal-
bum locutus de nare,' drawling through
his nose. Phyllis is the Thracian princess
Demophoon promised to marry, and
whose complaint is told in one of Ovid’s
most touching Epistles (Heroid. ii.).
‘Hypsipyle' was the daughter of Thoas
and queen of Lemnos when Jason lauded
there on his way to Colchis. He married
and left her, and she is made to pour out
her love and jealousy in another of Ovid’s
Epistles (Heroid. vi.). ‘Eliquatz' he
strains his speech like wine, that it may
come out as delicate as possible, and trips
his words upon his delicate palate, which
is an imitation of Horace, S. ii. 3. 274,
“ Quid, cum balba feris annoso verba
palato ?” Horace is speaking of a lewd
old inan ati'ecting youth. Forcellini says
‘eliquat’ means that he lets his speech
drip word by word like wine from a.
strainer. The other sense is better. That
