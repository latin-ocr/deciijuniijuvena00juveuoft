SATIRA VI.

INTRODUCTION.

szsms’ last satire, like Juvenal's, is a fragment. That he wrote slowly, as the
Grammarian says, may be easily believed, and his early death may have overtaken him
before he had time to finish this poem. This would give it an interest which in itself
it has not.

Τ110 poet has retired for the winter to the coast, and is living on the shores of the
Gulf of Spezia (Lunae portus), where, if the Scholiast is to be believed, his mother
lived aster her second marriage. He sits down to write to his friend Caesius Bassus,
the lyric poet3 and after paying a high compliment to his genius, he commends the
elimate and scenery and retirement of the place he is staying at. T here he lives free
from all anxiety and all jealousy of his neighbours' prosperity. He contrasts his own
state of mind with that of men, on the one hand, who deny themselves the necessarios
of life, and, on the other, who run through their estate in their youth with riotous
living. He expresses his resolution to enjoy what he has got, and advises all men to
deal liberally with their meanS, living up to their income, and being ready to help
a friend in time of need, even at the sacrifice of part of their estate. This suggestion
brings up the principal subject of the satire, which is the folly of those who deny
themselves for the sake of their heirs, a favourite subject with Horace. whether it
was the poet's intention to continue that subject to the end of the satire, or to put in
any other point of view the spirit of money-getting, it is impossible to say. But
I am surprised that Casanbon, Jahn, and others should treat the satire us an entire
composition. It is manifestly unfinished, and so the Grammarian's memoir ex-

s
