D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Magnum habitatorem, quanto felicior hic qui
Nil cuperet quam qui totum sibi posceret orbem,
Passurus gestis aequanda pericula rebus.

Nullum numen abest si sit Prudentia 2 nos te,
Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam.

315
Mensura tamen quae

Sufficiat census si quis me consulat edam :
In quantum sitis atque fames et frigora poscunt,
Quantum, Epicure, tibi parvis suffecit in hortis,

Quantum Socratici ceperunt ante penates.

320

Nunquam aliud Natura aliud Sapientia dicit.
Acribus exemplis videor te claudere: misce

Ergo aliquid nostris de moribus,- effice summam
Bis septem ordinibus quam lex dignatur Othonis.

Haec quoque si rugam trahit extenditque labellum,

325

Sume duos Equites, fac tertia, quadringenta.
Si nondum implevi gremium, si panditur ultra,

how the Cynie asked him not to stand be—
tween him and the sun, is known to every
schoolboy. Plutarch (vit. Alex. c. 14)
tells it thus: ὡς δὲ ἐκεῖνος (Alexander)
ἀσπασάμενος καὶ προσειπὼν αὐτὸν (Dio-
genes), ἠρώτησεν εἴ τινος τυγχάνει δεόμε-
νος· ‘ μικρὸν,’ εἶπεν, ⁵ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου μετα-
στῆθι.’ Πρὸς τοῦτο λέγεται τὸν Ἀλέξ-
ανδρον οὕτω διατεθῆναι καὶ θαυμάσαι
καταφρονηθέντα ’τὴν ὑπεροψίαν καὶ τὸ
μέγεθος τοῦ ἀνδρὸς, ὥστε τῶν περὶ αὐτὸν
ὡς ἀπῄεσαν διαγελώντων καὶ σκωπτόν-
των, ‘ ἀλλὰ μὴν ἐγὼ,’ εἶπεν, ‘ εἷ μὴ Ἀλέξ-
ανδρος ἤμην Διογένης ἂν ἤμην,’ which
does not mean, as it is commonly rcndered,
that if he had not been Alexander he should
have wished to be like DiogeneS, but that
he should have been like to himin 1115 con-
tempt for the world. The answers this
unmannerly Cynic is said to have got from
Aristippus are told iu Horace (Epp. i. 17.
13, sqq). As to Alexander see x. 168:
“Unus Pellaeo juveni non sufficit orbis.''
Juvenal calls Diogenes ‘ Magnum,' perhaps
because Alexander was so called.

315. Nullum numen abest] [In this
passage Ρω have ‘habes ε’ 501110 have
‘abest.' The writer, says Ribbeck, re-
peats the words ‘nullum numen . . .
deam' (x. 365) with evident pleasure.
But there is 110 pleasure in reading the
words here, for they have no intelligible
connexion with the context.] ⁶ In quan-
tuni’ means no more than ‘ quantum :² it

is ‘ to whatever lengths? As to Epicurus

see xiii. 123, n. The modesty of Socrates’
wants is well known from the Memora-
bilia of Xenophon and the Clouds of Aris-
tophanes, who made it a matter of ridicule.

321. Sapientia] [Nature which the
Stoics professed to follow as their guide
never differs from Sapientia or philosophy.
(See S. xiii. 20.) Μ. Antoninus says (vii.
11) : “ To the rational animal the same
act is according to nature and according
to reason.’']

322. videor te claudere :] He says “ per-
haps 1 seem to confine you by too rigid ex-
amples : well then, mix a little of modern
life with theirs: go as far as the amount
Otho fixed for the census of an eques ς or if
this is not enough, if this makes you frown
and pout your lip, take the worth of two
equites or even three ; make up a third
400,ooo :” ‘millia ' is to be supplied. All
this is explained 011 S. iii. 154. The way of
speaking is like Persius vi. 78, sqq. [Rib-
beck has ‘ludere' for ‘claudere‚' a conjec-
ture, 1 suppose, derived from ‘ eludere‚’ the
reading of Pg ; and a bad conjectura]

327. Sa· nondum implevi ⁸qremium,]
‘Gremium’ is so used in S. vii. 215: “ Quis
gremio Enceladi doctique Palaemonis affert
Quantum grammaticus meruit labor ?’' It
is the fold of the toga in which the purse
was commonly carried. Narcissus was
the chief favourite of Claudius Caesar. He
made a fortune of more than 100,000,000
sesterces (about 800‚Oool.) according to
Dion (60. 34). It was he and not Clau-
