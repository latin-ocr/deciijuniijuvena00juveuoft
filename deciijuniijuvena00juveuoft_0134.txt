D. JUNH JUVENALIS

Autumno, jam quartanam sperantibus aegris,
Stridebat deformis hiems praedamque recentem
Servabat: tamen hic properat velut urgeat Auster:

thue lacus suberant, ubi quanquam diruta servat

57. Autumnm] Horace calls it “Auctum-
nnsqne gravis Libitinae quaestus acerbae ’'
(S. ii. 6. 19, where various other places are
quoted). ‘Sperantibus’ means wishing for
the quartan⁹ as that stage in a fever when
it begins to amend. Ruperti takes it for
‘ expecting,’ that is, apprehending the ap-
¹nroach of this disease. According to Galen
the quartan “ dries up the phlegm and
melancholic humour,’' as Manutius ob·
serves on the following passage of Cicero’s
letter to Tiro (xvi. 11) : “Doleo te non va-
lere, sed quoniam in quartanam conversa
vis est morbi (sic enim scribit Curius) spero
te diligentia adhibita etiam firmiorem
fore.''

58. deformis hiems] Horace has ‘ in-
formes hiemes ’ (C. ii. 10. 15). He says
though the cold weather kept his fish fresh,
he made as much haste as if the south wind
were blowing‚ as it did in autumn (‘ plum-
beus Auster,' Hor. S. ii. 6. 18), which would
soon turn it, for which purpose Horace
invokes it, S. ii. 2. 40, “At VOS, Praesentes
Austri, coquite horum obsonia ! ''

60. thue lacus suberant,] The Lacus
Albanus, which still retains its name (Lago
di Albano) under Mons Albanus (Monte
Caro) in Latium, is about fourteen miles
south-east of Rome. Sec Hor. C. iv. 1. 19:
“Albanos prope te lacus Ponet marmoreum
sub trabe citrea.” Apalace built by Cn. Pom-
peius became the. property of the emperors,
and was greatly enlarged by Domitian, who
lived there a great deal. Some remains of
the buildings and gar-dens are still to be
seen. It is frequently referred to by Mar-
tial and others. The site of Alba Longa
was on the eastern shore of the lake, which
was named after it. The town was de-
stroyed by Tullus Hostilius, according to
Livy, 400 years after its foundation by As-
canius, the son of Aeneas, who according to
tradition transferred to Alba the govern-
mcnt established by his father at Lavinium,

and with it the fire of Vesta, imported from
Troy. Livy says that Tullus destroyed all ,
the public and private buildings, and re-
duced the town to ruins, but spared the
temples (i. 29). The reading ‘suberant,'
which was that of the Scholiast and is in
most MSS„ is suspicions. ‘ Superant’ ap-
pears in some. Heinrich thinks with Mark-
land the true reading is ¹ superat,' quoting
Virg. Ecl. viii. 6, “superas jam saxa 'ri-
mavi.” ‘ Suberant' means the lakes were
near.

61. Vestam colit Alba minorem] The
Scholiast on this place says that when Tul-
lus Hostilius destroyed Alba, the Romans
would have removed the sacred things from
the temples to Rome, but were deterred by
a great hailstorm, and accordingly they
continued to observe the worship of the
gods at Alba 3 which statement Lipsius
(de Vesta, c. 2) confirms by a reference to
Symmachus (Epp. ix. 120, 121), who,
writing towards the end of the fourth
century, speaks of the incest of one Pri-
mogenia, a vcstal priestess at Alba. The
Scholiast adds that Juvenal speaks of
Vestam minorem ‘ ad compositionem‚' that
is, by compar-ison with her worship at
Rome, which was instituted by Romulus
or Numa (Plutarch, Vit. Rom.).

63. Ut cessit‚] [Ribbeck has ‘At cessit:
facili ἀφ’]

64. Patres] Domitian used to convene
the Senate at his Alban house. Juvenal
says the senators are kept outside waiting
while the man with the fish finds ready ad-
mittance. The emperor he calls Atrides,
Agamemnon, and the fisherman a Picenian,
the fish having been caught at Ancon in
Picenum.

66. genialis agatur Iste dies :] ‘Let this
day be devoted to your genius ;’ like Horace,
‘ cras genium mero Cui-abis’ (C. iii. 17. 14),
and ‘genio indulgere’ (Pers. v. 151). As to
⁴ geniuS,' see note on Horace, Epp. i. 7. 94.
