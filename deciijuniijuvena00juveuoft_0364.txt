3111· D. JUNII JUVENALIS

saud tcachcrs 110 will never 001150 to love good living. Docs Rutilus train his son to
gentleness, holding that slaves and masters are (1110 110511, or cruclty, when all he
loves is the swect 50111111 of the 111511, 1110 monster of his trembling 110050110111, happiest
when a wretch 15 tortured for a 111110 Ρ what (1005 110 tcach 1115 boy who loves the
grating of the chain, the brand, aud workshop Ρ Shall Larga's child be pure who
cannot count her mother’s paramours? She was 1101 consulante, and now she writes
hel-own love letters at hcr dictatimi, and sends them by her filthy menials.

V. 31. It 15 but nature, home examplcs come with great authority, and so corrupt more
spccdily than any. One or two of better sort may 51111111 them, but others follow in
their fathcrs’ footsteps and the old track of crime long put before them. So keep
from wrong, if for no other reason yet for 11115, that those who are born of us will
imitate our faults, for all are tcachable in vice ; a Catiline you’ll find 111 every town,
a Cato or a Brutus nowhere.

V. 44. Let nothing foul approach that house that holds a boy. Away ye girls
aud parasites: great reverence is duc to boyS. If you are meditating wickedness
think not the child too young to sce it. whatever wrong yon do he'll grow up like
you not in face alone and stature but in morals, and follow in your footsteps ε and
after this you'll punish him and disinherit hin] forsooth! How can you act the
father when you the sire are worse, an empty-headed madman?

V. 59. When guests are coming you will sweep your house and scold and rave for fear
a speck of dirt offend the company, and yet you care not that your son should see his
home all 511011055. You give your country a great boon if you shall make him a good
citizen. It matters much how you shall train him up. The bird when fledged will
seek the food 1115 mother brought him in the nest.

V. 86. Cetronius took to buildiug every where grand niarblc houses, and so broke his
fortune: but 110 left his 5011 110 small inheritance‚ which he wasted in his turn 111
building finer houscs than his father.

V. 96. The father shows respect to the J ews' worship, the 5011 becomes a J ew and goes
all lengths with Moses' law.

V. 107. But though the young are prone to imitate all other vices, to avarice they're
forced against their will. They’re cheated with the show of gravity it wears, the
praise it wins for carefulness and skill in getting. These are the craftsmen to make
fortunes grow 1 Yes, any how, the forge and anvil working on for ever. The father
too thinks only misers happy, and bids his boys go on that road with those philoso-
phers. All vices have their rudiments, 111 these he trains them first and afterwards
they learn the insatiable desire for money. He pinchcs his slaves’ bellies and his own :
saves up the fragments and puts them under scal for next day's supper, a meal the
beggars would not share.

V. 135. What worth is money got at such a price? that madness is it to live a
pauper’s life in order to die rich 1 As money grows the love of it grows too. He
wants it least who has it not. So you go adding house to house and field to field,
and if your neighbour will not 5011, you send your beasts to eat his crops. ’Tis thus
that many properties change owners.

V. 152. But what will people say Ρ “And what care I for that P Ι do not value at a
beanshcll all the world's'praise if I am to be poor to ea1·nit.’' Then you are to escape
the paius and cares of life and live for many a year, because you’ve land as much as
Rome possessed when Tatius reigned 1 And after that two jugera was counted ample
for old soldiers broken 111 the wars, and they were well content. For us 'tis not
enough for pleasure-ground.

V. 173. Hence come more murders than from any cause, for he who would be rich
would be so quickly. And who that hastens to be rich cares aught for laws Ρ The
old Sabellian spake thus to his sons: “Be happy with your cottages and mountains:
