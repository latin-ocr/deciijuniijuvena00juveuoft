Vivitur hoc pacto ; sic novimus.

A. PERSII FLACCI

Ilia subter

Caecum vulnus habes ; sed lato balteus auro

Praetegit z ut mavis, da verba et decipe nervos

Si potes.

‘¹ Egregium cum me vicinia dicat
Non credam ‘?” V iso si palles, improbe, nummo,
Si facis in penem quicquid tibi venit amarum,
50

Si puteal multa cautus vibice flagellas,

Nequicquam populo bibulas donaveris aures.

Respue quod non es; tollat sua munera cerdo;
Tecum habita, noris quam sit tibi curta supellex.

“ Caedimur et totidem plagis consumimus
hostem‚'' but the application is different.
Here Persius means to say ‘men are all
one as bad as another, and he who strikes
now will presently get his own castigation :
this we all understand, and on these ternis
life goes on? Then he goes on to suppose
a man may have disease 111 him, but hide
it from the world: and he bids him deceive
his own nei-ves, if he can. But, says the
other, ‘ if the neighbours speak well of me,
must I not believe them ? ’ To which
the reply is, if 1115 conscience tells him he
is covetous, sensual, and a cheat, there is
no 1150 111 listening to what the people say.
‘ Sic novimus' is an incomplete expression,
111 whatever way we understand it. Hein-
rich supplies ‘nos 3' ‘this is the way we
know ourselves.' Jahn says it is ‘ sic
notum est,' ‘we all know it to be so.' I
think it means ‘we know this (or so we
have learned) from experience.' It was
the fashion for persons of consideration
about the court of the emperors to wear
‘ baltei: ‘baldrics‚' riehly ornamented
with plates of gold. They were worn
obliquely from the right shoulder. It
was properly a part of the military dress.
‘ Ut mavis ' is equivalent to ‘ esto.' ‘ Be
it so-the world cannot see it z it 15
111(1(1011 by your fine belt (that is your rank
hides it) ς but try and cheat your con-
seience? ‘ Dare verba' is ‘ to give words
for deeds‚’ and so ‘to deceive.' See S. iii.
19. ‘Nervi’ are the muscles. The an-
cients knew nothing of the nerveS‚ and so
mistook the seat of pain.

47. si palles, improbe, mcmmo,] We
have below “pallentes radere mores,''
v. 15.

48. amanum] This is the reading of
all the MSS„ and seems to be an adapta-
tion of the Greek πικρόν, which is used in
various senses in which mischief is implied.
John of Salisbury (Nugae, &c.iii. 5) quotes
the verse with ‘quicquid tibi venit amo-
rum,' but his quotation is evidently from
memory, and his reading is not to be
trusted. Ι (10 not see the difficulty in
‘amarum' that Jahn does. He takes
‘ amorum ³ from John.

49. Si puteal multa] The meaning of
this line has been much disputed. It
means something that the man should not
do ; but what? ‘ Puteal Libonis ' was the
place in the Forum Romanum where
money-lenders did their business, as is
generally believed. (Hor. S. ii. 6. 35,
“Roscius orabat sibi adesses ad Puteal
cras.”) It would seem then that the
man whipped the Puteal severely, which
may be, overreached the people who did
business with him, being himself up to the
tricks of trade (cautus). ,

51. tollat sua munera cerdo ;] ‘Let
the cobbler carry off his gift of flattery.'
Juvenal uses ‘ cerdones ’ for the lowest of
the people, S. iv. 153, “ Sed periit post-
quam cerdonibus esse timendus Coeperat ;''
S. viii. 182, “et quae Turpia cerdoni
Volesos Brutumque decebunt.''' He finishes
with a good line: ‘Live with yourself',
and you will soon find how scanty is your
furniture:’ enter into your own mind,
look round as a tenant inspeets his new
lodging, and you will see how little good

it contains. After ‘tecum habita' the “

MSS. have ‘ut' or ‘et’ or ‘aut‚’ but a con-
junction only weakens the language.
