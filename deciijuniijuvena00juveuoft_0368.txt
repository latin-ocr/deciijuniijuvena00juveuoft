D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Tum felix quoties aliquis tortore vocato
Uritur ardenti duo propter lintea ferro?

Quid suadet juveni laetus stridore catenae,
Quem mire afliciunt inscripta ergastula, carcer

Rusticus ¹?

Exspectas ut non sit- adultera Largae

Filia, quae nunquam maternos dicere moechos
Tam cito nec tanto poterit contexere cursu

Ut non ter decies respiret?

Virgo fuit ς ceras nunc hac dictante pusillas

Implet, et ad moechum dat eisdem ferre cinaedis.

Sic natura jubet : velocius et citius nos
Corrumpunt vitiorum exempla domestica, magnis

Quum subeunt animos auctoribus.

Forsitan haec spernant juvenes, quibus arte benigna

Et meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan 3

torturing of slaves, at least till the time of
the Antonines.

23. laetus stridore antenna] See S. xi.
80 : “ Squalidus in magna fastidit compede
foss01·,''and vi. 151, n. on ‘ergastula.' ‘In-
scripta' means the brand upon the forc-
head of the slaves, as F for ‘fugitivus'
and so forth. The branded ‘ergastula'
are the branded slaves who worked there.
See Lipsius, Elect. ii. 15. To my ear it is
incredibie that Jahn and Hermann should
have separated ‘ Rusticus ' from ‘ carcer'
and put the (P) there. They conceive that
Juvenal is iinitating Horaee's “Rusticus
exspectat dum defluat amnis'' (Epp. i. 2.
42). Doederlein is the author of this
pointing [which Ribbeck follows]. Nothing
can be plainer than that Juvenal adds
‘carcer Rusticus ³ to ¹ ergastula ⁵ by way
of comparing those dens of suffering with
the ‘ carcer ³ at Rome.

27. tanto poterit contexere eursu] She
cannot string them together at such a pace
(as we say) but that she must take bre-ath
three times in the tclling. WVhen she was
quite a girl she was her mother’s accom-
plice; now she writes at her mother'sdicta-
tion her own little love letters, and sends
them by the same wretches her mother
had employed before her (vi. 233, “ missis
a corruptore tabellis ⁵³). In this satire on
parents this is the only reference to mo-
thers. . ‘ Cinaedis' is here only a term of
disgust. He had said before,

“Scilicet exspectas ut tradat mater ho-
nestos

25
Conscia matri
3ο
Unus et alter
35

Atque alios mores quam quos habet:
utile porro
Filiolam turpi vetulae producere turpem .'’
(vi. 239, sqq.)

33. Quum subeunt animos] P. has ‘ sub-
eunt? Most of the MSS. have ‘subeant‚'
which Jahn has adopted against his own
Ms„ as in xi. 178 lie has taken the indica-
tive where P. has the subjunctive. In the
latter case he is right ς in the other I be-
lieve he is wrong. Juvenal says “more
rapidly and suddenly are we corrupted by
the examples of vices when they are found
in our own home, that is when they enter
our minds with the weight of great autho-
rity ;’' the second clause is suppleinental
to the first. ‘Quum subeant' would be
‘ because they enter‚' which would be good
sense, but the other is more terse, and like
J uvenal's style, and if ever Jahn was to
trust his Ms. he might 'have done so here.
“Vitiorum exempla domestica'' may be
compared with “fraternum nomen populi
Romani'' (Caesar, B. G. i. 36, and Long's
note). Hermann has ‘subeunt,’ putting
the comma before ‘domestica,’ which ap-
pears to me to spoil the verse. As to
⁶ auctoribus’ sce viii. 216, “deis auctori-
bus‚'' ‘ on the authority of the gods,’ and
Horace, C. i. 28. 13, 11., “non sordidus
auctor.”

35. finxit praecordia Tisiam] That is
Prometheus. See S. vi. 13, n. ς fviii. 133,
n. He says some few young men may
reject these exmnples, who are made of bet-
ter stuff than others, but the rest follow in
