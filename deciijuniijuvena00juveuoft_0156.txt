SATIRA VI.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS vigorous and wonderfully copious satire is written in the form of an epistle to a
person named Postumus Ursidius, who is about to be married. The poet remonstrates
with him upon so mad a proceeding, and takes occasion to represent the vices and folh'es
of women in such colours and under such a variety of forms, as might well stag-ger a man
who intended to take a wife from that generation, and appal one who, as he supposes
may be the case with his friend, had already committed himself to that false step. But
the friend is an imaginary person, and only furnishes the handle for such severe treat-
ment as the sex has never suffered before or since. The general truth of the picture
Juvenal draws is suffieiently attested by other writers, and may be inferred from the
honest and genuine tone of the satire itself. J uvenal's was the heroic age of female
corruption : there were giunts of vice in those days, as there were of passion and exalted
tenderness in the times of fable and tradition. Messallina was to wantonness what
Medea was to outraged love, and Antigone to a woman’s self- devotion 3 the difference
being that these were the creations of an exquisite imagination and the embodying of
a poet's ideal, while the other went beyond all that imagination could have conceived or
poets would have ventured to feign in the realities of a woman’s daily licentiousness.
The nature of the examples Juvenal chooses and the extravagant character of the
times he lived in limit the application of the worst parts of this satire almost to one
generation. Though all ages of refinement produce female vice and weakness in abun-
dance, it may be hoped if Juvenal had lived to expose modern women to themselves and
to the world, he would, even in the worst days of their dcbauchery and foIIy, have taken
different ground, and painted his characters in less superhuman proportions3 though
Dryden, by apologizing to the ladies his contemporaries for translating the satire, leaves
the impression that it is not without its application to them. The chief interest of the
poem lies in the great powers of language and uncompromising force of indignation that
it displays‚ and in the historica] picture it contains of the manners of the times.
Adultery is the vice with which the poem opens. It is said to have existed before all
others, and to have begnn when the simplicity of snvage life, with its rude freedom from
temptatim, gave place to the refinements of civilized society. The increase of wealth
and the introduction of foreign manners through the conquests of Rome, and the idleness
of peace, are the causes to which Juvenal attributes, in common with others, t-he
deterioration of morals and the gradual growth of those stupendous vices that he
describes. Eastern impostures and Greek debunchery very quickly took* root in the
soil of Rome, and brought forth the. fruits of a rampant superstition and profligacy,
