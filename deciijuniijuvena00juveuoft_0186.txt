286. Unde haec monstra lamen] His
answer to this question is, riches aud idle-
11655, 1116 fruit of peace, are the cause of all
this profligacy. then Latin women were
poor they were chaste‚ and labour kept vice
out of their doors when their hands were
hard with spinning, and when danger
threatened the gates of Rome, and their
husbands were fighting for their country's
safety. Augustine, in one of his letters 10
Marcellinus (Class. iii. Ep.138‚ Edit. Bened.),
quotes these fine lines to show that it was
not Christianity but money that brought
ruin upon Rome. Except that he has ‘ in
turre ' (v. 291), he quotes the passage as it

is in the text. Sallust (Bell. Cat. 6—12)
gives much 1116 531116 account of the growth
of vice in Rome, and it 15 worth while to
read Augustine’s commentary on Sallust in
the 18th chapter of his treatisc De Civitate
Dei, the title of which is Quae de moribus
Romanorum aut metu repressis aut securi-
tate resolutis Sallustii prodat historia.

543, while his army in Capua was be-
sieged by Fulvius Flaccus the consul,
Hannibal, in order to force him to raise
the siege, marched a force against Rome.
The greatest terror prevailed in the city.
The women fiocked to the temples to pray,
while their husbands and sons manned the
walls. It happened that two newly-raised
legions were in the city. The consul hur-
ried up from Capua with a great part of his
army, aud the Albans sent a force to assist.
Hannibal was unable therefore to do any
thing but ravage the surrounding country
and retire. The description Livy gives of
the state of the city and the conduct of the
women accounts for Juvenal taking this in-
cident for his illustration. The route that
Hannibal took from Capua to Rome is un-
certain. It is generally supposed he came
round to the north of the city, where he
encamped within four miles of the walls.
The porta Collina was the northern gate, that
by which the Gaulsare said to have entered.
