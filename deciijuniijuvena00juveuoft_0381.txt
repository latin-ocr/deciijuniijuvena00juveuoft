191. Accipe ceras,] The father of the
present day makes his son get up in the
middle of the night in winter and bids him
write, plead, study hard at the law, or
petition for a centurion’s command, any
thing to get money. The titles and first
few words of the laws were commonly
written with red, called ‘rnbrica,' from
which are derived our word rubi-ic and
the use of rubrics. The substance used
was ‘ minium‚' vermilion ; so Cicero speaks
to Atticus of his “cerae miniatulae '⁷ (xvi.
11) and “mimatae'' (xv. 14). It was
common to make corrections in red, and to
these Cicero is good-humouredly referring.
Quintilian (Inst. xii. 3) speaks of those
“qui se ad album ac rubricas transtule-
runt,’' that is, who had taken to the study
of the law, ‘ album ' representing the edicts
of the praetors, and ‘ rubricae ³ the ‘ leges?
(See Dict. 'Ant.‚ ‘Album’ and ‘Atramen-
tum.') See Persius v. 90: “Excepto si
quid Masuri rubrica vetavit.’' ‘ Libellus '
is a petition. ‘ Vitem ' is the vine-switch
used for military floggings (viii. 247, n.).
The ‘tribunus’ was the only offic-cr who
had the authority to order a military
flogging, but the inferior officers inflicted
the cane summarily it appears (see Lip-
sius, de Mil. Rom. v. 18).

194. Sed caput intactum buxo] ¹ Buxo’
is here put for a comb of box-wood. Ovid
(Fast. vi. 229) has

“Non mihi detonsos (dentosa) crines de-
pectere buxo,
Non ungues ferro subsecuisse licet.'’

Par-figgfrites an epigram to a bald person
xiv. :

“ Quid faciet nullos hic inventura capillos
Mizlgfipd? buxus quae tibi dente da-

The man tells his son he must let his hair
grow wild and let the officer see that he
is a rough shaggy fellow. See Persius
iii. 77, n.: “ Hic aliquis de gente hircosa
centurionum.” “ Hispida membra quidem
et durae per brachia setae Promittuut atro-
cem animum ’' (S. ii. 11). Laelius is put
for the commander of the troops to whom
his petition, if he presented one, would be
referred.

196. Dirue Maurorum αἰθρία-9,] ‘At-
tegia ' Forcellini supposes to be an African
word. It is a hut. The Brigantes were a
British people occupying the north of Eng-
land from Mancunium (Manchester) 011 the
south-west to Segedunum (Shields) on the
north-east. Their chief town was Ebora-
cum (York). Tacitus (Agric. xvii.) speaks of
the Brigantes as being the largest tribe in
Britain. They also occupied the hill country
of Cumberland and Westmoreland, in which
they had probably many of the ‘castella’
Juvenal mentions, They gave a good deal
of trouble to Agricola, and it appears they
were not quiet when this satire was written.
The date cannot however be fixed.

197. Ut locupletem aquilam] Pliny
speaking of the vine (H. N. xiv. 1, sub
fin.) has these words: “ Quid quod insertae
castris summam rerum imperiumque con—
tinent? Centurionum in manu vitis et
opimo praemio tardos ordines ad lentas
perducit aquilas, atque etiam in delictis
poenam ipsam honorat? This explains
this verse and 193. The ‘ primipilus cen-
turio ’ (x. 94, n.) had charge of the engle
of the legion, and was above all the cen-
turions in rank and pay. The promotion
of the centurione, ns l'liny's remark shows,
was slow. Lipsius says they rose from the
lowest grade to the highest by rotation,
except in cases of extruordinary merit (de
Mil. Rom. ii. 8). The ten cohorts of the
