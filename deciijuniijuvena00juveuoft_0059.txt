SATIRA Ι. 9

Haec ego non agitem? Sed quid magis Heracleas
Aut Diomedeas aut mugitum Labyrinthi
Et mare percussum puero fabrumque volantem,

Quum leno accipiat moechi bona, si capiendi

55

Jus nullum uxori, doctus spectare lacunar,

Doctus et ad calicem vigilanti stertere naso 3
Quum sas esse putet curam spectare cohortis
Qui bona donavit praesepibus, et caret omni

Majorum censu dum pervolat axe citato

60

Flaminiam puer? Automedon nam lora tenebat
Ipse lacernatae quum se jactaret amicae.
Nonne libet medio ceras implere capaces

Persius and Juvenal as the representative
of Roman satire. Lucilius was more in
J uvenal's way, and he mentions him below
(v. 165) with respect. No one should be
misled by the Scholiast's note ε “ Lucernam
dicit quia Satyrici ad omnium vitia quasi lu-
cernam admovent, et ut adurant et ut osten-
dant crimina.’' ⁴ Lucerna' only means what
wemean when wespeak of the‘midnight oil.'

52. Sed quid magis Heraclea-5] ‘ Agitem'
must be repeated, but in a different sense.
He asks why he should rather write on such
hackneyed subjects as the labours of Her—
cules, the wanderings of Diomed, the ad-
ventures of Theseus, Icarus, and Daedalus,
thau attack the vices of the day? Jahn
punctuates differently and badly, ‘ Sed quid
magis? Heracleas,’ ἃς.

55. Quum leno accipiat moechibona] This
man connives at his wife's intrigues at his
own table, like the inan Galba, mentioned
below (S. v. 4), and gets her paramour to
make him his ‘ heres‚’ which the woman
could not be under the ‘ lex Voconia,' if the
man's census exceeded a certain amount.
‘Accipiat bona' Heinrich understands to
mean that he was made ‘ heres ex asse‚’
that is, he succeeded to the man's whole
estate. (See Long’s orations of Cicero,
vol. i. p. 121 sqq„ for a full discussion of
the ‘ lex Voconia,' which may perhaps be
referred to here, though there may be some
doubt whether Juvenal is alluding to this
Lex.) Suetonius (c. 8) says that Domitian
took away from women of loose character
¹ lecticae usum, jusque capiendi legata here-
ditataeque ς’ but these must be women who
had been convicted, whereas, Juvenal is
attacking the vices of private society, as
Heinrich observes. As to ‘ lacunar,' see
Hor. S. ii. 3. 272, n.

57. vigilanti stertere naso ;] So Ovid says
(Amor. i. 5. 13) :

“ Ipse miser vidi cum me dormire putares
Sobrius apposito crimina vestra mero.’'

The Scholiast Acron quotes this verse on
Hor. C. iii. 6. 29: “Sed jussa coram non
sine conscio Surgit inarito.”

58. taumfas esseputet] “ then that
man thinks he has a right to look for a
tribune's place who, while yet a boy, wasted
his substance on his stables‚ and lost his
patrimony with flying on swift coach down
the Flaminian road: for he was Autome-
don and held the reins while the great man
made himself pleasant to his man-mistress.''
's his person may have been some favourite
of Domitian's‚ who had been made, or
hoped to be made, a ‘ tribunusmilitum' (see
xvi. 20, n.). The Scholium on ‘praesepibus’
is ‘⁴ Neronem tangit ;'’ but this seems to be-
long to ‘ ipse,’ which is often used inde-
pendently for ‘ the great man ' (S. v. 86,
n.), and is here opposed to Automedon,
as Achilles to his eharioteer. Madvig
(Opusc. i. 36) denies that there is any allu-
sion to Nero, and says that ‘ ipse’ is plainly
the driver. There may be two opinions on
the subject3 but after much reflectiou Ι
have adopted the other with Heinrich. ‘ La-
cerna' is a man's cloak, and ‘ lacernatae’
means that the ‘ amica’ was a inan. Two
men are recorded as having been formally
married to Nero, named Sporus and Py.
thagoras (Sueton. c. 28, and Tacitus, Ann.
xv. 37). ‘ Jactaret' may be ‘ showedhim-
s'elf offl’ or something of that sort. Madvig
finds great difficulty in this interpretation.
