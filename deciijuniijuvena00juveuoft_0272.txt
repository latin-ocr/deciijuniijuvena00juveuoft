D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Instabile ae dirimi coeptum et jam paene solutum

Conjugium in multis domibus servabit adulter.

Quo te circumagas? quae prima aut ultima ponas?
Nullum ergo meritum est, ingrate ac perfide, nullum,
Quod tibi filiolus vel filia nascitur ex me?

Tollis enim et libris actorum spargere gaudes

Argumenta viri.

Foribus suspende coronas,

J am pater es : dedimus quod famae opponere possis 3
J ura parentis habes, propter me scriberis heres,
Legatum omne capis, nec non et dulce caducum.
Commoda praeterea jungentur multa caducis

Si numerum, si tres implever0.—-J usta doloris,
Contra tamen ille quid affert ’.Ρ-

Naevole, causa tui.

Negligit atque alium bipedem sibi quaerit asellum.

81. Quo te eireumayas ?] He aslis his
master which way he will turn (for an au·
swer), how he will arrange his argument in
reply? ‘Quae prima aut ultima ponas’
Heinrich says is taken from the arrange-
ment of the ‘calculi ³ at draughts or some
such game.

84. 'Pollis enim] “For you rear them
(the children Ι beget) and are pleased to
puhlish in the news the proofs of your
manhood.'' Births and deaths were puh-
lished in the news, as with us (see S. ii.
136). As to ‘tollere' see S. vi. 38, n. He
tells him he may hang fiowers before 1115
11001· 111 rcjoicing for the birth of a child:
the practice therefore was not confined to
weddings. See vi. 51: “Necte coronam
Postibus et densos per limina tende corym-

bos.''

86. Jam pateram] By the Lex Julia
et Papia Poppaea (Dict. Ant.³ ‘Juliae
Leges'), which was a law giving certain
advantages to married persons, a man who
had no children (orbus), if he was above
twenty-five and under sixty, could only
take half of an ‘hereditas ³ or ‘legatu1n.’
The rest became ‘caducum‚' and fell to
the ‘heredes’ or ‘legati' under the will
who had children, under certain limitations
of consanguinity. Pailing any such claim-
ants the money went to the public trea-
sury (aerarium) (Dict. Aut„ ‘Bona eaduca').
The man who had children had ‘jura paren-
tis’ or ‘jus liberorum‚' which was some-
times given as a favour to those who were
‘orhi.' The man tells his master it was
all owing to him that, not being ‘ orbus?
he could be made ‘ heres ex asse‚' that is
heir to an entire property, that he could

take a legacy without forfeiting half, and
moreover could take a ‘ caducum ³ forfeited
by any other ‘heres' or legatee. The ‘jus
trium liberorum ' applied to those who
had three children living at Rome, and ex-
empted them from the office of tutor or
curator. In the election of magistrates he
who had most children had a claim on that
account to be preferred to one who had
fewer, and so in the allotment of provinces.
Likewise a candidate for office who was
under the legal age was allowed one year
for each child if he had three or more. All
these advantages the man says he can se-
cure his master when he shall have got him
three children (Aul. Gell. ii. 15, Conradi's
note). Martial not having three children
by his wife prayed Domitian to give him
‘jus trium liberorum’ and got it, where—
upon he put away his wife, or wrote as if
he meant to do so :

“Natorum mihi jus trium roganti
Musarum pretium dedit mearum
Solus qui poterat. Valebis, uxorx
Non debet domini perire munus.”

(11. 92.)

Pliny the Younger got the same privilege

granted him hy Trajan, for which he wrote

the emperor a letter of earncst thanks
x. 2 .

( 90). Jusloe d0l0r2's‚] His friend keeps up
the gravity of the dialogue, and pretends
to sympathize with the ill-used man.

92. alium bipedem sibi quaerit asellum]
This, which sonnds equivocaL is plain
enough in the original. He gets himself
another, a two-legged ass. Another fami-
liar instance is in the New Testament:
