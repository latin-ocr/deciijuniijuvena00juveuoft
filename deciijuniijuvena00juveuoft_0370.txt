D. JUNII J UVENALIS

Turpe paras, ne tu pueri contempseris annos,
Sed peccaturo obsistat tibi filius infans.

Nam si quid dignum Censoris fecerit ira

50

Quandoque et similem tibi se non corpore tantum
Nec vultu dederit, morum quoque filius et qui
Omnia deterius tua per vestigia peccet,

Corripies nimirum et castigabis acerbo

Clamore ac post haec tabulas mutare parabis.

Unde tibi frontem libertatemque parentis

Quum facias pejora senex, vacuumque cerebro

J am pridem caput hoc ventosa cucurbita quaerat?
Hospite venturo cessabit nemo tuorum.

48. ne iu pueri contempserit annos,]
‘⁴ Do not despise the child's age or think
he is too young to take notice :³³ an ex-
cellent remark as every parent knOWS.
‘ Tu ' is commonly used to give point to a
general piece of advice. The reading of
P. and nearly all the MSS. is ‘nec’ for
‘ne,' and Hermann adopts it. It could
only mean ‘nor even‚’ and so Hermann
takes it. But it only weakens the clause,
I think.

49. obsisz‘at] P. and some others have
‘ obstet,' which was the Scholiast’s read-
ing; most have ‘ obsistat.' The hiatus is
so unneeessary and sounds so bad from the
meeting of the same vowel, that with
Heinrich I have adopted ‘obsistat.’ [Rib-
beck has ‘ obstet.']

51. Quandoque] P. 1135 here preserved
the true reading. Most MSS. have ‘quan-
doquidem,' which gives no sense. ‘ Quan-
doque’ is like ‘olim,’ ‘some day?
says “if your boy some day does some-
thing worthy of the censor’s displeasure,
and not only shows himself like you 111
form and face, but as the son and inheritor
of your character, and one to follow in
your steps and exaggerate all your faults,
then of course you will take him up and
reproach him loudly and bitterly and
threaten to alter your will.'' He speaks
ironically.

56. Unde tibi frontem] Horace uses
this sort of idiom twice, S. ii. 5. 102:
“ Unde mihi tam fortem tamque fidelem ?''
and 7. 116: “Unde mihi lapidem P-Quor-
sum est opus ? Unde sagittas ?” ‘ Para'
may be understood here and ‘parabo'
there. The Scholiast quotes Terence
(Phormio, v. 8. 53): “ quo ore illum objur-
gabis ?³’ ‘ Frontem’ is here the command-
ing brow of one in authority. In xi. 204,
“salva fronte'' means ‘without shame.'

57. vacuumque cerebro] This means
that the man is mad and wants cupping.
‘Cucurbita’ is a cupping glass, so called
from its having the shape of a gourd which
is the first meaning of the word. The ‘cu-
curbita' is called ‘ventosa’ from ignorance
of the principle on which it acts. Instead
of being ‘plena acris‚' as Ruperti says, a
partial vacuum is created in the cup, which
being so applied to any part of the body
removes the pressure of the air from that
spot and causes a rush of blood to it.
The ancients used both dry cupping and
bleeding as we do for affections of the
head in particular. The cup was usually
of bronze or of horn. ‘Caput hoc' is
dramatic, as if he put his finger on the
man’s forehead.

59. Hospite venturo] He goes on to say
that 3 great fuss is made when company is
coming, to get the house in order and to
make a show with the plate, furniture, and
marble. The master rushes about like a
madman with a stick in his hand, calling
to the slaves to do their work. But is
it not of more consequence, he asks, that
your son should see your home free from
vice and spotless, than that your friend
should see your furniture in that 0011-
dition? The picture is well drawn and
the moral well applied. As to the rich
pavements of the Romans sec notes on
Hor. S. ii. 4. 83: “Ten' lapides varios
lutulenta radere pahna,'‘' and Epp. i. 10.
19 : “Deterius Libycis olet aut nitet herba

lapillis ‚9⁹⁵ As to ‘columnas’ compare
Horace, C. ii. 18. 3 ε

“ Non trabes Hymettiae
Premuut columnas ultima recisas
Africa.”

‘ Vasa aspera ' are opposed to ‘vasa pura)
