SATIRA I.

Venerit in lingua& unde istud dedecus, in quo

Pedius quid? crimina rasis

was a later name for the‘ equites. ' The
origin of it is uncertain (see 1·”ι ειη-0111111).
Persius says, When blei-ir -e3ed fathers
teach their boys to adinire such ¹'tuti as this,
do you ask where ull this medle3 in our
speech has come from, or that indecent
practice of beardless boys juinping up on
the benches (and applauding, r?')

83. Nilne pudet capili] He suppos es a
man on trial for thest. But even in defend-
ing himself the man (he calls him Pedius)
must balance his sentences in polished anti-
theses, and look out for applause. ‘Capiti
cano ' is the dative case, and the epithet is
only thrown in for effect. ‘Tepidum' is
‘ lukewarm ' and ‘ decenter ' is but qualified
praise. ‘Ait’ is ‘the prosecutor says!
Persius probably takes his name Pedius
from Horace's orator, of whom not much
is known (see note on S. i. 10. 28). As to
‘ posuisse ’ see Persius, v. 70, n.‚ and S. v.
3. ‘Romule’ stands for a descendant of
Romulus. ‘Cevere' is said of the vilest
sort of men, and he asks in indignation
whether Romulus is a man or something
viler than vile women that he should
applaud such trash. Catullus (xxix. 5)
says “Cinaede Romule, haec videbis et
feres ?” Passow says the obscene sense is
not meant here. Ι think it is. [Jahn
reads‘ doctas posuisse figuras Laudatur. ']

88. Men’ moveat? quippe et]‘ ‘would
he (Pedius) move me? I suppose if a
shipwrecked man were to sing me a song Ι
should take out au as and give it him!
What, you sing, do you, when you carry your-
self about in 8 picture, floating on a bit of
your wreek? 'rhe man must tell some

= tale of real sorrow, not made up at night,

who wants to move me with his story.”

ο This punctuation 1 have adopted with

Passow and Heinrich. Most editors take

‘men’ moveat' 33ith33'hat follows, making
much confusion. ‘Nocte paratum’ is a
fictitious tale made up, as poets 33 rite their
stories, at night. (JuV. i. 51, n.‚ “Υ enu-
sina digna lucerna? ¹) Horace (Α. Ρ. 102)
has‘ ‘Si 3is me flere dolendum ost P rimum
ipsi tibi: ’33hieh Persius may ha3e remem-
bered. ‘Incur3 asse' stands for the sim ple
nord ‘.'flectere The sailor and his beg-
ging picture are referred, to in Juv. xi3.

92. qSed numeris decor est] “ But (says
one) we have added grace and unity to the
crude verse of our fathers Thus do we
learn to sing of Attis, and Arion riding on
the delphin 03 er the waters of the sea; this
is the way 33e stole a rib from lengthy
Apennine.'' ‘Claudere sic versum' is
like Horace' s “neque enim concludere
versum Dixeris esse satis,'’ and‘ ‘Si quis
pedibus quid claudere senis '⁹ (S. i. 4. 40 ς
10. 59). ‘ Sic’ is ‘after this fashion.’
‘Junctura’ is a comprehensive word not
easily rendered. Perhaps we may eall it
‘harmony.' Quintilian (Inst. ix. 4. 32)
says it lies “in verbis, incIsis, memhris,
periodis ;'’ that is, in the words and diffe-
rent parts of a sentence. Horace (A. P.
48) speaks of “callida junctum? the elever
connexion of words with their eontext;
and he speaks (ib. 242) of the force com-
position derives from “series junctumque?
that is, the regular flow and connexion of
the language and parts. Attis or Atys
33as a favour-ite of Cybele, and he is called
Berecyntius, from a. mountain' 111 Phrygia,
33here Cybele 33 as worshipped. The story
of Arion, the minstrel ot Lesbos, who was
threnn 03 erboard and carried to shore on
the back of a dolphin, is told by Herodotus
(i. 21). The next line about tho Apen-
nines was probably found m some poem of
