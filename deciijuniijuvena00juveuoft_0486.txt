The reading of most MSS. in 9 is ‘est
operae cognoscere,' which Heinrich rejects
for the reading of the text, because of
‘jubet ’ 111 the next line. I have followed
his judgment without being sure he is
right. ‘Pretium' would usually follow
‘ operae?

10. Cor jubet hoe Enni] ‘Cor Enni'
is equivalent to ‘Ennius cordatus: as
Turnebus observes (Adv. 30. 7). ‘Cor-
datus ³ 15 a word Ennius used, and it sig-
111605 ‘wisef So Horace has ‘sententia
dia Catonis' for ‘Cato divine sentiens'
(S. i. 2. 32), and other like phrases. 800
note ou J uv. iv. 39, and Index (Geuitive).
-postquam desierim} esse] This verb
is not used elsewhere, and the construction
is Greek and elliptical. ‘He ceased to
snore' is ‘he ceased to dream,’ that he was
Maeonides (Homer), and had become
Quintus Ennius after passing through a
peacock, in which the soul of Pythagoras
had lived. Heinrich joins Quintus with
Maeonides as it might be Q. Ennius. I
do not see why, if that be the connexion,
the praenomen should not have been put
in its proper place. Horace, alluding to
this dream, which was recorded at the
beginning of Ennius' Annales (as the
Scholiasts here audon Horace tell us) says:

“Ennius et sapiens et fortis et alter Ho-
merus,
Ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur
Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pytha-
gorea.”

(Epp. ii. 1. 50, sqq„ see note.)

The Scholiast and others give five steps by
which he became Quintus Ennius, and
from which his name was given him.
Pythagoras, says the Scholiast, passed
into a peacock‚ and thence to the body of
Euphorbus (Hor. C. i. 28. 10, 11.), thence
to Homer, and from Homer to Ennius.

Tei-tullian (De Resurr. Carnis, 0. 1) makes
the order different: Euphorbus, Pytha-
goras, Homer, the peacock, Ennius. This
dream is referred to in the Prologus, v. 2.
Persius means Ennius gave his country-
men this good advice after 110 113(1 left off
(lreaming, and got back to his good sense,
his ‘con’ Juv. vii. 159. Ρο15. 1. 12, 11.
12. Et quid praeparet Auster] So
virgil says, “quid cogitet humidus Aus-
ter '³ (Georg. i. 462). 800 11010 011 Hor.
S. ii. 6. 18, “Nec mala me ambitio perdit
nec plumbeus Auster Auctumnusque gra-
vis.’' ‘Angulus ille' is like “O si angu-
lus ille Proximus accedat qui nunc denor-

mat agellum '³ (Hor. S. 11 6. 8). ‘Adeo
omnes' is ‘absolutely all?

“indignum quod sit, pejoribus ortus, Hic
tibi sit potius quam tu mirabilis illi.’'
Persius was an ‘eques' ‘Senium,’ for
SourneSS, 15 used as ‘canities' in S. i. 9,
where see note. ‘Curvus' and. ‘minui'
explain each other. ‘Usque recusem' is
copied insensibly from Horace, S. ii. 7. 24,
“ Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat usque
recuses.” ‘Coenare 51110 uncto' is to dine
without delicacies, for which ‘unctus' is
a constant epithet. See S. iii. 1023 iv.
17, and Horace, A. P. 422, “Si vero est
unctum qui recte ponere possit.” Some
take ‘sine uncto' to mean ‘without oil-
ing‚' but that is not the sense. ‘ Vapida
lagena’ is like “Exhalet vapida laesum
pice sessilis obba'’ (S. v. 148), where
‘vapida’ properly refers to the ‘obba‚' '
01 rather to its contents. ‘Signum’ is
the 5031 with which the ‘lagenass or
‘amphora,' was sealed. ‘Naso tetigisse'
is to put his nose down so close as to touch
it, which he would do in examining the
scal to see if the servants had been after
his nasty stuff.

orti’ 15 copied from Horace (Epp. i. 6. 22), ⁴
