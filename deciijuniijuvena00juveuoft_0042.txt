his opinion. The fourth 8111110, as it stands, 11115 1111 introduction of
thirty-six verseS, which have been added, as Ribbeck assumes, by
some nnskilful hand. 1Ιο 15 1101 1110 first critic or rcader who has felt
some surprise at finding a long Prologue to nothing, for the first thirty-
six lines have no connexion with the real subject of the Satire, though
there are 0111105 who admire 11115 Prologue and think it 15 appro-
priate and a fine piece of composition. The beginning of the Prologue
announces that Crispinus is again brought on the stage, and the writer
declares his intention 10 summon him often to play his part. We
expect that wc are going to read a terrible invective against the fellow3
but after a few general remarks about his villany‚ we are told that the
present Satire will only trcat of his smaller offences, and then comes the
particular charge against him of buying a fish at an enormous price,
and eating it himself. The mention of the fish is supposed by the
admirers of the Prologue 10 be a elever way of connecting the intro-
duction with 1110 10111 8111110, 1110 subject of which 15 1110 great fish that
was presented to Domitian. But what becomes of Crispinus after this
flourish? He plays a most insignificant part in the scene before the
Emperor, and says not a word about the big fish, though something
would have been very much to the purpose from a man who was a
buyer of fish, and in 1115 early days cried them through the streets of
Rome. If Juvenal wrote this Prologue to the Satire, we cannot
commend his taste. Ribbeck goes into particulars, and examines
various parts of this Prologue in order to confirm his ,general con-
demnation of it.

The other long passage, which Ribbeck treats as an interpolation, 15
1110 Introduction of fifty-five lines which is prefixed to the eleventh
satire. This Introduction resembles that to the fourth Satire in this
respect, that if you cut it off, you lose nothing of the real Satire, which
is an invitation to a friend 10 001110 1111(1 (11110 with Juvenal. This
friendly epistle is a charming composition, and reminds us, as Ribbeck
observes, of Horace’s humour and genial temper. If Juvenal wrote the
Pmlogue, he would have done better if he had commenced his epistle
at once without a preface.

This Essay also contains a short chapter on verses which have been
transposed in Juvenal’s text, and on the passages where something ⁷
appears 10 have been lost. The last chapter, written 111 Latin, 15 on
the famous sixth Satire, the disorderly arrangement of which the learned
critic has attempted to correct.

This ingenious Essay contains matter which a sumne editor of Juvenal
