no difficulty about. So sau· as this Ι admit: he has proved clearly
enough that thero arc very numm-st ‹litl'erenccs between tlw inante-r and
the style of tho. ten Satires which he assigns to duvenal, nnd tlw live
which he has handlvd so unmcrcisully. These five Satin-os ιιιϊ muru-«l
by great faults, and contain comparativi-ly few good lines. They arc
indeed feeble compositionis* as satires, when compared with the vigui-ons
work of the earlier pieces, thc best of which are perhaps those which
cannot be read with young men. If any Satire of the live is to be
excepted from this general condemnatiou, it is the thirteentli: but many
parts even of that Satire arc open to just censure. As to the famous
tenth, if we do not except to the matter, we may allow that there is
some merit in the manner in which the subject is treated ; but even if
this admission is made, it is still nothing more thau a frothy declama-
tion. Both the matter and the style of the tenth form a striking contrast
to another Satire, the third, which is jnstly admircd. It is a living
picture. ’

The question then is, whether the same man wrote or could write all
these Satires, a question which Ribbeck answers by affirming that he
could not3 and he labours hard to prove his assertion. Bnt it is im-
possible to say what a man may do in the way of writing, for the same
men have written wisc books and foolish books, bad poetry and good
poetry. The same difficulty exists as to some of Cicero's orations,
which are so bad that some excellent critics maintain that Cicero
could not have written them ; but ou the other hand there are critics,
both old and new, who admire the spurious orations, and think they are
very fine.

As to the· sixteenth Satire, which is manifestly a fragment, it is
admitted by Ribbeck that this may be a piece of the true Juvenal’s
work.

In a second chapter Ribbeck discusses the interpolations in the ten
Satires. His hypothesis, he says, about the five Declamations would
fare badly, if we accepted the ten Satires in their present som] as the
genuine work of Juvena13 for all the faults which have led him to
reject the five Declamations, are found here and there in the ten
Satires3 and these bits of patchwork resemble so much the whole texture
of the five Declamations, that if we allow them to stand where they
are, we must admit that the poet could exhibit in the same Satire the
skill of a master and the stupidity of a bungler. However, there is no
necessity, he says, for this admission, for the ten Satires are dis-
figured by interpolations which have been remarked on by many recent
critics; and indeed nobody who has read Juvenal with any care will
deny that there are interpolated verses. Ribbeck has only increased the
number of them. There are two long passages, which Ribbeck assumes
