SATIRA XII.

Et claudentem oculos gallinam impendat amico

Tam sterili.

Nulla unquam pro patre cadet.

Verum haec nimia est impensa ; coturnix

Scntire calorem

Si coepit locuples Gallita et Paccius orbi,

Legitime fixis vestitur tota tabellis

100

Porticus ς exsistunt qui promittunt hecatomben,
Quatenus hic non sunt nec venales elephanti,
Nec Latio aut usquam sub nostro sidere talis
Bellua concipitur, sed furva gente petita.

98. Sentit-e calorem] He says if a rich
person without children takes a sever,
men hang their walls with tablets in-
scribed with prayers for his or her re·
covery, and vows of sacrifices, or whatever
it might be, if the prayer should be
granted. These tablets were common on
all occasions of this sort or of other im-
portant pmyem, and they were hung up
in the house of the person praying, or in
the temples, or on the statues of the gods,
as above (x. 55): “Propter quae fas
oet genua incerare deorum.” Tablcts so
inscribed were also carried before the
victims to the altar. Pliny the Younger,
writing to Trajan (Ep. x. 44), says : “Sol-
lennia vota pro incolumitate tua, qua
publica salus continetur, et suscipimus,
domine, et solvimus, precati Deos ut velint
ea semper solvi semperque signari.’' All
such vows were made in public, a princi-
ple observed generally in respect to prayer,
which was held suspicions if it were secret.
As to ‘ porticus' see S. vi. 163, n.

101. exsistunt qui promittunt hecatom-
ben,] ‘Exsistunt qui' cannot properly be
said to stand for ‘sunt qui? The rule
in respect to ‘ sunt qui ' is that it takes the
subjunctive when the persons are in-
definite, and the indicative when they
are definite (Hor. C. i. 1. 3 : “ Sunt quos
curriculo pulverem Olympicum Collegisse
juvat ’'). [Psgs have ‘promittant‚’
which is also the reading of Jahn and
Ribbeck: the other MSS. have ‘pro-
mittunt‚’ the better reading here.] “ Per-
sons start up who promise a hecatomb
(that is a hundred bulls)‚ since elephants
are not for sale in these parts, and are
not bred in Latium or any where under
our skies.” He means if there were ele-
phants they would have been vowed in-
stead. ‘Quatenus’ is used by Horace
and others iu this sense, as in S. i. 3. 78,
“ Quatenus excidi penitus vitium irae
Cetera item nequeunt stultis hacrentia‚’'

and elsewhere. ‘ Nec venales elephanti,
Nec Latio aut usquam ' is like Horace's

“Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus aut
arator igni ε
Nec-prata canis albicant pruinis.”

(C. i. 4. 2, and note.)

‘Nec venales' is opposed to ‘nec concipi-
tur,’ and ¹ aut’ joins ‘ Latio' and ‘usquam.’
The change to the finite construction ‘ bel-
lua concipitur‚' where ‘concepti’ (ele-
phanti) would be expected, is a common
Latin usage. (S. xi. 32, n.)

104. sed furva yente petita] ‘Petita'
agrees with ‘ bellua,' and ‘ Caesaris armen-
tum’ is in apposition with it. ‘Furva
gente’ are the Indians (S. xi. 125, sq.).
He says the emperors kept herds of ele-
phants in the country of the Rutuli in
Latium and of Turnus who was their
king. They were kept for public shows.
These beasts are not prepared to serve
any private person, since their ancestors
obeyed the orders of Hannibal (whom he
calls Tyrius as Carthage wasa Phoeniciau
settlement), aud Roman generals, and
Pyrrhus the king of EpiruS‚ to which
country the Molossi belonged (S. xiv. 162).
It was he who first brought elephants over
into Italy, and the battle of Heraclea (13.c.
280), when it was almost decided against
him, he turned with his reserve of ele-
phants, which the Roman cavalry would
not face. Livy (xxi. 28) describes how
Hannibal got his elephants over the Rhone.
They were thirty-seven in number. The
appearance of these animals helped him in
crossing the Alps by the terror they struck
into the mountaineers. They suffered
terribly on that march (see Polybius, iii.
54, 55). Livy (xxxv. 36) says that the
Romans first used elephants in the war
against Philip of Macedon Rc. 200. This
was the year after the conclusion of the
second Punic war, in which Livy says these
elephants were taken. Elephants were first
