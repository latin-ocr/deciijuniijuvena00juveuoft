D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Pacuvius without children, their porticos are lined with praying tabletS. Some
vow a hecatomb (sor clephants we have none in Latium, except the cmperor’s herd,
the sons of those that carried Hannibal and Pyrrhus and our own great men). But
Novius and Hister would have oll'ercd these. For one of them would sacrifice his
fincst slaves, or crown his maid for thc altar or his child, though he must not expect
a miracle. My countryman is right z a thousand ships arc nothing to a will. For if
the patient should recover, he will dcstroy the will and leave his money to Pacuvius,
who prayed for his recovery and obtained it. And so Pacuvius triumphs, such return
he gets for the mere killing of his daughter.

V. 128. Long live Pacuvius, three Nestors' lives ς let all that Nero stole be his, gold
mountains high, and not a friend in all the world.

NATALI, Corvine, die mihi dulcior haec lux,
Qua festus promissa deis animalia caespes

Exspectat.

Niveam Reginae ducimus agnam 3

Par vellus dabitur pugnanti Gorgone Maura :

1. Natali, Corvine, die] The welcoming
of the day that reminds us of our birth,
and assigning to it a gladness which it
rarely inspires after childhood, is a conven-
tionality as old as history. The Romans
from the earliest times observed their birth-
days and those of their rulers and great
men and their friends, as religious holidays,
with prayers and sacrifices, as we have
seen in the last satire (v. 85. See also S.
v. 37 3 ix. 51 ; and Horace's Ode on Maece-
nas’ birthday‚ iv. 11) z

¹‘ ,J ure sollennis mihi sanctiorque
Paene natali proprio, quod ex hac
Luce Maecenas meus affluentes
Ordinat annos.’'

As to ‘ caespes,' turf altars were commonly
used by persons of moderate means. Ho-
race offers victims to Venus (C. i. 19. 13)
and to Liber (iii. 8. 4) “ caespite vivo.”

3. Niveam Reyinae ducimus aynam ,·]
White victims were offered to the gods
above, and black to those below, χθόνιοι.

“ (ᾆιιῆῒῡυοτᾉήο primum nigrantes terga ju-
Colnesr‘gictciisit‚ frontique invergit vina sacer-
dos.'’ (Aen. vi. 243.)

This was Aeneas’ offering to the gods be-
low. Dido offering to Oeres, Phoebus, and
Lyaeus, offers a white cow.

“ Ipsa tenens dextra pateram pulcherrima
Dido

Candentis vaccae media inter cornua
sunditss’

The worship of J uno Regina was brought
from Veii by Camillus, according to Livy,
and a temple was built to her under that
name on the Aventine (v. 22, &c.). Cicero
speaks of her having temples at Melita and
Samos: “ Teque, J uno Regina, cujus duo
sana duabus in insulis posita sociorum, Meli-
tae et Sami '³ (In Verr. ii. 5. 72). She had
many other titlcs, as Matrona (Hor. C. iii.
5. 59), Lucina, Moneta, &c. The Scholiast
mentions a reading ‘Fortunae‚’ but it is
obviously false. She who fought with the
Gorgon (that is on her ‘aegis') was Minerva,
to whom he has promised a like offering for
the preservation of his friend. The gods to
whom they offered on such occasions were
perhaps chosen rather arbitrarily, or cir-
cumstances might direct the choice 111 some
instances. Horace gives the credit of his
own preservation now to the Muses (C. iii.
4. 27) and now to Liber (iii. 8. 5). But Ju-
piter, J uno, and Minerva were commonly
worshipped together. The temple on the
Capitoline hill consisted of three parts, of
which the middle was dedicated to Jupiter
Opt. Max„ that on the right to Juno, and
the other to Minerva. The Gorgon Medusa,
whose head Perseus cut off and Pallas placed
upon her ‘ aegis,' was by some traditions an
inhabitant of Africa, and so Juvenal calls
her ‘Maura.’ ‘Pugnanti Gorgone’ is in
construction like ‘ clipeo venientis et has-
ta’ (xi. 106). It is not the ablative of the
instrument, as Mr. Mayor says : it is
“ fighting armed with the Gorgon '’ as the
other is “ coming armed with shield and
spear.''
