SATIRA Ι.

INTRODUCTION.

THE object of this satire is to ridicule the litei-ary taste of the day. The poet begins
with a verse supposed to be taken from a poem of his own, which he begins repeating to
a friend. The friend tells him no one will read his poeti-y ς and this gives him occasion
to express his contempt fer public opinion and his reasons for despising it3 which are,
that while every body must 111-110 and spout, every body writes and spouts for effect, and
none are satisfied without vulgar applause. So men write lewd verses to catch wanton
ears, and mincing stuff to please the delicate 0111105. The man upon his trial is not
satisfied unless the court applaud his eloquence. And what is this applause? The rich
man has it of course, while behind his bac-k he is only laughed at ; and whoever gets it
must be content to share it with the feeblest drivellers, and to earn it by pandering to
a vieious taste, and avoiding all offenee to the great people. He appeals at last to the
admirers of the worthies of the old Greek comedy—“ Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristopha-
nesque poetae ³³—and is ready to abide by their judgment.

We cannot rightly infer from this that Persius had written or had not written 111
any other style than satire. The opening verse is not one 110 would have chosen as a
specimen of his style if he wished to produce something very good, audit is plainly
only made for the occasion. It is neither very good nor very bad. It is a specimen of
the morbid school of sentimental poctry, and reminds us of the celebrated parody of
Byrou 111 1110 Rejected Addresses, ‘⁶ Where nought is every thing, and every thing is
nought 3³³ and though it is not impossible that Persius may have suffered for some of
his juvenile productions, as our poet had suffered before he wrote the English Bards
and Scotch Reviewers‚ in which the spirit of this satire is sometimes seen, there is no
necessity for supposing it was written under such provocation.

The form 111 which it is written, involving frequent interruptions and many supposed
speakers and several quotations from poenis of the day aud opposing sentiments and
criticisms, eonstitutes the chief difficulty of the satire. Ι have tried to make these
matters plain, but Ι have had to differ in turn from the other eommentators, sometimes
agreeing with one and sometimes with another. Any one who tries to read the satire
without a great deal of study and without help, will see how diffieult it is to follow the
argument and to determine the arrangement. The allusions are soon disposed of, and
do not constitute the chief difficulty in reading Persius.

There is no elue to the date.
