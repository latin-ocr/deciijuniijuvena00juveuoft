92 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

reward for which you are ready to break your rest, to anticipato your brother parasites
at uncoutli hours of the morning. The wine is 50011 that wool refuses it. It turns
the gucsts to Corybante& squabbling first, and then throwing cnps to break each other’s
heads3 the 11051 meanwhile 15 drinking thc oldest wi110s‚0f which he'd grudge a
cyathus to a friend who’d got the heartbnrn. 110 has tine cups of amber set with
stones; if the like is given to you, a watch is set to see your nails are not too busy.
There’s some excuse for him ; for Virro, like his neighbourS, sticks 1115 finest jewels on
his cups. But long-nosed earthenware and cracked is good enough for yon. The
master gets 1115 water iced, not you. A black slave hands your enp, such as you’d sear
to meet among the tombs: the flower of Asia wnits on him, bought at a price beyond
the wealth of kings. He’s much too great to mix a poor man's wine. His beauty and
his age become 1115 pride. He’s angry at your sitting while he stands. Every great
house is full of these proud menials. One hands you sulkily a crust of hard and musty
bread to try your teeth 3 the fine white loaf is kept for the master's eating. There’s
one stands by to sce you keep to your own broad-basket.

V. 76-106. And this, you cry, was what I left my home for and 11101οᾱ 1110 rain and
winds of the Esquiline ! See that great lobster on a noble dish, that looks down scorn-
fully upon the guests—that goes to the master. You get a scanty crab with half 0-0
egg—a sort of funeral dinner. He oils his fish with fine Venafran 3 while your poor
cabbage stinks of the lantern and such stuff as Libya sends, and such that Romans will
not bathe with blacks, and snakes turn from them. The master gets his mullet from
the provinces (for craving bellies sweep them from our seas) and lampreys caught by
venturous fishermen in the Sicilian strait : while you must put up with an eel like a
long snake, or river fish all spotted with the frost and fattened in the sewers.

V. 107-113. But now a word with 1110 11011 man himself. Nobody asks of you the
bounties good rich men of old would send to their poor friends. In those days to be
counted bountiful was more esteemed than fasces and inscriptions. We only beg you’ll
dine as a citizen should ; 111011 spend your money as you please.

V. 113—124. See before the host is a fat goose's liver and a fowl as big as a goose, a
boar that Meleager might have killed, and truffles if ’tis spring. (‘ Keep your corn,
Libya‚' the glutton eries, ‘ but send us truffies.’) To make 0110 angry as can be, you
see the carver flourishing his knife and (laneing till 110 goes through all his Iesson.
'Tis of the first importanee with what gestures hares and fowls are carved.

V. 125—131. You’ll be dragged by the heels and put out of the door if you venture to
open your mouth, as if you were a freeman born. Do you suppose the great man
will ever drink 10 you? Is any of you 50 bold as 10 pass him the cup and say ‘Drink ?’
There are many things a man dare not say with holes in his coat.

V. 132—145. But if the gods or some good man gave you a fortune, what a friend you
would soon become of Virro's! “ Here, help Trebius, put it before Trebius : allow me,
my dear brother, to help you from the loin.'' It’s the money that is dear brother.
But if you want to be the master's master, you must not have a little son or daughter.
A barren wife makes pleasant friends. But if your wife presents you with three
fine boys at a birth, there’s no offence. The Virros will adore your little brood.

V. 146—155. Suspicious mushrooms are for the poor friends, boletus for the master.
Phaeacian apples, stolen you’d think from the Hesperides, are for the host and favoured
guests : you feed but on their smell, and eat such rotten fruit as the monkey gnaws
on the goat’s back learning his drill.

V. 156—173. Perhaps you think 'tis stinginess in Virro. He does it all to vex you.
What fun so great as a disappointed belly P He wants to see you cry with rage and
gnash your teeth. You think yourself a freernan and the rich one's guest: he thinks
the smell of the kitehen draws you, and he's right. What freeman is 50 poor that he
would bear such treatment twice Ρ Υοο’10 cheated with false hopes of a good dinner.
