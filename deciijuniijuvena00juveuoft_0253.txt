SATIRA vill.

2 03

Tunc licet a Pico numeres genuS, altaque si te
Nomina delectant, ornnem Titanida pugnam
Inter majores ipsumque Promethea ponas:

De quocunque voles proavum tibi sumito libro.

Quod si praecipitem rapit ambitio atque libido,

135

Si frangis virgas sociorum in sang-uine, si te
Delectant hebetes lasso lictore secures,
Incipit ipsorum contra te stare parentum
Nobilitas claramque facem praeferre pudendis.

Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se

140

Crimen habet, quanto major qui peceat habetur.
Quo mihi te solitum falsas signare tabellas

In templis quae feeit avus statuamque parentis
Ante triumphalem? quo si nocturnus adulter

Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo ⁴?

harpie8‚ and ‘ curvis unguibus ³ represents
the Greek Ὑαμψῶνυξ. Here the wife is
meant.

131. Tunc licet a Pico] Picus was a
son of Saturnus, and an early mythical king
of Italy. ‘ Omnem Titanida pugnam ' is
the Same as ‘omnes Titanas pugnatores!
They were sons of Earth, and Prometheus
was one of them. The force of 'ipsulm’
Prometheus himself, is that he was reputed
to have been the creator of man. ‘Avus,'
‘proavus,' ‘abavus,’ ‘atavus,‘ ‘tritavus ' is
the ascending scale, but each of these words
is used generieally for ancestors. ‘Quo-
cunque libro’ is any story book. Most
MSS. have ‘tunc' or ‘tum' in v. 131,
which is wanted after ‘si.’ Jahn [and
Ribbeck] have ‘tu,' from P. and others.
The Scholiast had ‘tu.’ [Ribbeck omits
v. 134 from his text.]

136. Si sranyis virgas] Scourging was
practised only on those who were not Ro-
man citizens. There was a Lex Porcia
which forbade any citizen to be seourged.
“Facinus est vincire civem Romanunm
scelus verberare 3 prope parricidium necare;
quid dicam in crucem tollere Ρ verbo satis
digno tam nefaria res appellari nullo modo
potest ’' (Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 66). Of this
enormity Verres was guilty. The usual
way of putting to death was by bcheading.
The cross was contined to slaves and the
lowest malefactors. ‘ Lasso lictore ' is like
‘lassis caedentibus’ in vi. 4811. [Ribbeck
omits vv. 140, 141 as expressing only the
same thing as the two vigorous preceding

verseS, and expressing it in a dry general
sententious manner. lt may be that Ju-
venal did not think as the critic does3
though most men of taste would probably
say that this passage weakens the satire.
See v. 53, note]

142. Quo mihi te] After ‘quo‚' ‘to
what purpose,' an ellipse is commonly found
(see above, v. 9). Here we may under-
stand ‘jactas ' or ‘ ostentas! He says,
‘ What is the use of your boasting of your-¹
selt' to mc, if you are in the habit of forging
wills in the temples your ancestor built,
and in the face of your father's statue P’
wius were sometimes executed and kept in
the teinpleS. As to the triumphal statue
see above, v. 3. We have ‘ signator falso '
in S. i. 67.

145. Santonico] The Santones were a
Gallic people north of the Garonne. Their
name remains in the town of Saintes. They
made woollen manufactures. See Martial
xiv. 128 : “Gallia Santonico vestit tebardo-
cucullo.'' As to ‘ cucullus' see S. vi. 117.
Another woollen dress from Gaul is men-
tioned in iii. 103, ‘ accipit endromidem?

146. Praeter majorum cineres] This is
explained on S. i. last line. ⁸ Carpenturn ’
was a covered carriage on two whcels, as
may bc scen by the woodcuts in Sinith’s
Dic-t. Ant. As to the various names of
eoaches see note on Hor. Epp. i. 11. 28.
Juvenal is speaking of the way in which
rnen of family degi-ade themselves as couch-
men (see S. i. 59, n.)‚ and says that actually
a consul may be seen puttingabig drag on
