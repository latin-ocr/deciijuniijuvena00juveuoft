D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Huic quisquam vellet servire deorum !
Sed qualis rediit? nempe una nave, cruentis

185'

Fluctibus, ac tarda per densa cadavera prora.
Has toties optata exegit gloria poenas !

“ Da spatium vitae, multos da, Juppiter, annos !”
Hoc recto vultu, solum hoc et pallidus optas.

Sed quam continuis et quantis longa senectus
Deformem et tetrum ante omnia vultum

Plena malis 1

Dissimilemque sui, deformem pro cute pellem
Pendentesque genas et tales aspice rugas,
Quales, umbriferos ubi pandit Tabraca saltus,

In vetula scalpit jam mater simia bucca.

familiar with Herodotus. The stories he
tells were current, 118 says, and that was
enough for him.

18ῧι nempe nna nave‚] Justin (ii. 13)
says he crossed the Hellespont in a fishing-
boat, and adds some suitable reflections.
Herodotus (viii. 118) tells us one account
he had heard of Xerxes' retreat was this :
that having accompanied his land forces
through Boeotia and Thessalia, as far as
Eion, at the mouth of the Strymon in
Thrace, he there gave charge of the army
to Hydarnes to lead them to the Hellespont,
and embarked himself in a Phoenician ship.
They were overtaken by a storm. The king
in alarin asked the pilot if there was any
safety. The pilot said the only chance was
to lighten the ship, whereupon the king
appealed to his subjects and many of them
juinped overboard. They arrived safely on
the coast of Asia, whereupon Xerxes or-
dered a crown of gold to be given to the
pilot for saving the king, but his head to be
taken off for lesing so many of his people.
Herodotus is as incredulous as Juvenal
could wish about this story. Juvenal says
the king escaped from Salamis with only
one ship‚ and that his flight was retarded
by the multitude of corpses floating about
the scene of battle. Horace says of Cleo-
patra : “ Minuit furorem Vix una sospes
navis ab ignibus '’ (C. i. 37. 12).

187. Has toties optata] Heinrich calls
this a superfluous application, as v. 146, and
rejects the verse. With all his good sense
he is too keen sometimes, like many of his
countrymen.

189. *Hoc recto vultu, 4550] Heinrich and
others take this to mean unabashed and
pale with anxiety. ‘Recta faeie ³ is used in
this sense in vi. 401, and Bentley in the

195

same sense substitutes ‘ rectis ' for ‘ siccis '
in Hor. (C. i. 3. 18) ε

“ Qui siccis oculis monstra natantia
Qui vidit mare turbidum?

Others take ‘recto vultu’ as ‘well,' op-
posed to ‘pallida,' ‘ill,’ and Ι think that
{slighgbbineaning There is nothing about

‘⁴ Flnlarge my life with multitude of days!
In health and sickness thus the suppliant
pra ys.” (Johnson.)

One of the best examples of the common-
place Juvenal is here dwelling on is in that
ode of Sophocles (Oed. Col. 1211) which

begins

ὅστις τοῦ πλέονος μέρους
χρῄζει τοῦ μετρίου παρεὶς
ζώειν.

192. deformem pro cute pellem] Forcel-
lini distinguishes ‘cutis' from ‘pellis’ as
the living and dead skin. When ‘ pellis ' is
applied to living men and women it is coarse
skin‚ or withered. Lucretius describes
persons dying of a plague as having

“Compressae nares, nasi primoris acumen
Tenulelz cavati oculi, cava tempora, frigida
pe is

Duraque.’' (vi. 1193.)

The reader may compare with this descrip-
tion Horace's ode to Ligurinas, iv. 10.
194. ubi pandit Tabraca saltu-53] Ta.-
braca (Tabarkah) was a townoin Numidia.
It was surrounded with jungle, and aa
usual the woods abounded in monkeys.
Herod. iv. 194, speaks of apes being com·
mon in one part of North Africa, and
