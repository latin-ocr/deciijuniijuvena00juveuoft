Hos quoque felices qui ferre incommoda vitae
Nec jactare jug-um vita didicere magistra.
Quae tam festa dies ut cesset prodere furem,

Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili.
Nona aetas agitur pejoraque secula ferri
Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa

SATIRA XIII. 295
Perfidiam, fraudes, atque omni ex erimine lucrum
Quaesitum, et partos gladio vel pyxide nummos? 25
Rari quippe boni: numerus vix est totidem quot

Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo.

23. Quae tamfesla dies] The dishonest
did not stop their trade because it was a
holiday: “the better the day the better the
deed‚'’ as Grangaeus says, quoting the
thieves’ proverb. ‘ Pyxide ’ is a box, here
for poisons. The number of gates of Boeo-
tian Thebes was the same as of the Nilc’s
mouths, which the ancients reckonod to be
seven, taking the priucipal outlets of the
river. 'l'hey are now but two. [Ribbeck
has removed vv. 23—27 and placed them
aster v. 158.]

The common reading in 26, which Jahn,
Hermann [and Ribbeck] have followed, is
“numero vix sunt totidem.'' Some good
MSS. have ‘numerus vix est? lt is pro-
bable that the other reading is au emenda-
tion by copyists who did not understand
the construction. Ruperti quotes a like

said that it was a comet sent to declare the
end of the niuth and the beginning of the
tenth age. Censorinus (de Die Natali, cap.
17) has a more dctailed account of these
ages, which he also makes ten. Plutarch
iu his life of Sulla (c. 7) says that certain
prodigies which happened while Marius was
laying his schemes against his country were
interpreted by the 'l'uscau wise meu as iu-
dieating the passing of the world into an-
other age, for that there were eight period&
making up in their sum the Great Year, and
that the gods marked the transition from
one to the other by some signs from hea-
ven. It is clear that some notions of this
sort were received by such of the Romans
as gave heed to these matters, but they
were vagne and to such men as Juvenal
immaterial. It is the mcrest pedantry to

one from Cornelius Nepos (Iphic. c. 2): judge hislanguage here by any rulc of accu-

“ Exercitui cujus numerus duodecim mil-
lium fuit? ‘ 'rotidem’ is the genitive of
quantity 3 their number consists of so
man .

28³: Nona aetas ayitur] He puts the age
very low. The third (S. vi. 23), or according
to Hesiod the fifth (Op. et Di. 109, sqq.)‚
or as Ovid says the fourth (Met. i. 89, sqq )
was iron, and what must the ninth be Ρ In
my Introduction to Horace's Carmen Secu-
lare there are some remarks from Jahn on
the notions said to be held by the Etrus-
cans and Romans about the division of the
Magnus Annus into ten ageS, of which the
last was to see the restoration of the uui-
verse to its original condition as it was in
the first or golden age. Particulars are
given iu Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. i. 137, sq.
Servius in his commentary on Virgil's 9th
Ecbgue, v. 47, ‘⁶ Ecce Dionaei processit
Caesaris astrum‚'’ says that when the star
appeared which was seen in the middle of
the day at the Ludi Seculares of Augustus,
and which was said to be Cacsar's star,
Vulcanius an haruspex came forward and

racy or to reject his word ‘ nona ' because
it does not fall in with what is said by the
above authorities on the subject. They
differ among themselves, as well theymight.
All that Juvenal says is that the age stood
very low in the downward scale of depra-
vity, and that the iron age, which was bad
enough, was not so bad as that. The ages
went down according to the value of cer-
tain metals, but no metal was cheap enough
to designate the age hc wrote in. Ruperti
thinks the verse is rather to be mended than
explained. Heineeke's conjecture (Ani-
madv. p. 19) of ‘non' in the sense of
‘nonne' Heinrich bas auswcred. P. has
‘nunc‚’ which Jahn [and Ribbeck] have
adopted. All the other MSS. have ‘ nona ’
or ‘ nova’ which is only a corruption of
the same word. Hermann, though as
zealous for P. as Jahn, keeps ‘ nona,'
which lie calls ‘ argutissimum epitheton?
1 do not know exactly what he means.
‘Nunc' he justly calls ‘frigidissima par-
ticula.’
