Squaloremque rei, pupillum ad jura vocantem

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

135

Circumscriptorem, cujus manantia fletu

Ora puellares faciunt incerta capilli.

Naturae imperio gemimus, quum funus adultae
Virginis occurrit, vel terra clauditur infans

Et minor igne rogi.

Quis enim bonus ct face dignus 140

Arcana, qualem Cereris vult csse sacerdos,

Ulla aliena sibi credat mala?

Separat hoc nos

A grege mutorum, atque ideo venerabile soli
Sortiti ingenium, divinorumque capaces,

Atque exercendis capiendisque artibus apti,

145

Sensum a caelesti demissum traximus arce,

Cujus egent prona et terram spectantia.

unwashed toga, and so forth, put on by
persons in sorrow or on trial (Pers. i. 83).
Heinrich quotes Aen. ii. 93 z “Et casum
insontis mecum indignabar amici.’'

135. pupillum adjura vocantem] The
proper expression for bringing a man be-
fore the court is ⁶ in jus vocare,’ which is
explained on Horace, S. i. 9. 77. ‘Cir-
cumscribere ³ is used twice above (x. 222,
xiv. 237). When a ‘pupillus ' came of age
he could bring an action against his tutor
for mismanagement of his property. If
the tutor was condemned the penalty was
‘ infamia.’ (See Long’s article ‘ Tutor ’ in
Dict. Ant.) Boys wore long hair till they
took the ‘toga virilis.' This is therefore
the case of a ‘ pupillus ³ complaining of his
tutor during his pupilage. The tutor in
such cases was sometimes removed.

140. Et minor igne myzl] That is ‘ too
little to be burnt.' According to Pliny
(H. N. vii. 16) it was not usual to burn
children who died before they had cut
their teeth.

——face dz'tqnus Arc-anm] There were no
mysteries at Rome analogous to those of
Greece, at which none but the initiated
could be present. They were bound by
oath to keep secret the mysteries (whatever
they were) then made known to them. As
every Greek might be initiated if he pleased
the secrecy did not amount to much. Never-
theless it passed into a proverb and the
Romans took it from the Greeks, so that
Horace says,

“ Est et fideli tuta silentio
Merces : vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum

Mundi

Solvat phaselon.''
(C. iii. 2. 25, and note.) .

Ceres represented the Greek Demeter, and
the allusion there as herc is to the Eleu-
sinian mysteries, an Attic festival which
lasted seven days. On the fifth the ini-
tiated carried torches to the temple of the
goddess, led by a priest called from his
office δᾳδοῦχος. This explains ‘face ar-
cana‚’ and Juvenal says no man would be
worthy to join the torch-bearcrs at the fes-
tival of Eleusis who thought himself un-
concerned in any of the misfortunes of his
neighbourS. The allusion in S. vi. 50,
“ Paucae adeo Cereris vittas contingere dig-
nae,’' is different, as the note will show.
Terence (Heaut. i. 1. 25) makes his old man
say “ Homo sum: humani nihila me alie-
num puto.”

143. venerabile soli Sortiti inyenium,]
‘ Venerabile' here I think has an active
meaning. There is nothing that so distin-
guishes man from the beasts as his reve·
rence for the divine Being. ‘ Venerabile in-
genium ' I take to be a reverential mind.
The active meaning of adjectives in ‘ bilis ’
is common. ‘ Venerabilis' is so used. See
Forcellini‚ who gives two instanees from
Valerius Maximus.

146. demissum trax-imus aree‚] ‘'h-a-
here' is often used in the various senses of
⁶ ducere.’ See note on S. xii. 8, and Hor.
C. iv. 2. 59, Epod. xiv. 4.

147. prona et terram spectantia] Thir
may be imitated from Ovid (Met. i. 84) :

‘⁶ Pronaque cum spectent animalia caeter?
Ostliiloliiiiii’i sublime dedit caelumque tuer
