SATI RA V Ι.

435

Amsovrr jam bruma foco te, Basse, Sabino?

Jamne lyra et tetrico vivunt tibi pectine chordae?

hIire opifex numeris veterum primordia vocum

Atque marem strepitum fidis intendisse Latinae,

Mox juvenes agitare jocos et pollice honesto 5

Egregius lusisse senes.

1. Admovit jam brttmasoco] Horace
retii-ed to his Sabine farm for warmth:
“multa et praeclara minantis Si vacuum
tepido cepisset villula tecto ” (S. ii. 3. 10,
n.). ‘Tetrico' shows that his style was
severe, but we,havc no remains to judge
by. Casaubon and others think there is
a spleciaslagllusion here tf?- Mopls Teltricus
in e ine country, om e c arae-
ter of which Servius says dull meu were
called ‘tetrici’ (Serv. Aen. vii. 713).
‘Opifex' goes with ‘intendisse‚’ like
“negatas artifex sequi voces '’ (Prol. 11),
and so ‘egregius’ goes with ‘agitare.’
‘Veterum primordia vocum’ seems to
mean that Bassus used archaic words,
which practice Horace condemns, but
Persius seems, or professes for his friend's
sake, to admire it. Casaubon asks what
Bassus had to do with words, and sub-
stitutes ‘rerum,’ which Heinrich adopts,
against all the MSS. It would be as easy
to ask what had Bassus to do with the
elementa of things. Lucretius (iv. 531)
has ⁸ primordia vocum ’ in a different con-
nexion, for elementary sounds. Jahn and
others think Bassus may have written a
poem upon the elements of language. Ι
agree with Weber, who holds the other
opinion ς but it is not easy to say, as we do
not know what Bassus wrote. We have
two lines of his lest, one of which is an
hexameter. ‘Marem strepitum’ is such
as Horace describes in his address to
Pollio (C. ii. 1), ‘¹ Jam nunc minaci mur-
mure cornuum Perstringis aures, jam
litui strepunt? διο. ‘Juvenes jocos,’ the
sports of the young, especially in love.
Casaubon compares Horace, A. P. 83,

sqq-2

“Musa dedit fidibus divos puerosque de-
Etogiirgilem victorem et equum certamine
Etle-tigetrlittlim curas et libera vina referre.''

Heinrich on conjecture has ‘jocis,’ saying
‘agitare jocos' is not Latin. It is not
always easy to decide what is not Latin.
‘Agitare jocos' may be said as ‘agitare

Mihi nunc Ligus ora

moenia,‘ quoted from Florus (i. 1) hy
Forcellini ; ‘to construct' verses of which
‘joci' were the subject. ‘Lusisse' hus
the same meaning, not ‘to 1nock,’ hut ⁸ to
sing of,' as “Ludere quae vellem calamo
permisit agresti'' (Virg. Ecl. i. 10). 1
do not see how Heinrich gets the meaning
of ‘delectare’ from ‘ lusisse? Most Mss.
have ‘egregios‚' but ‘egregius’ has good
authority. It is common to interpret
these verses as alluding to satires of
Bassus. But they have nothing to do
with satire. He wrote verses on young
men's love-sports and old men's wisdom,
perhaps, or whatever it may have been.

6. Mihi nune Ligus ora] Hc had gone
down to the Ligurian coast to pass the
winter. Horace tells his friend he shall
go to the sea-side when the winter comes

on (Epp. i. 7. 10, sqq.):

“Quodosi bruma nives Albanis illinet
Adaffixgze descendet vates tuus, et sibi

parcet,
Contractusque leget.’'

Horace has “defendens pisces hiemat
mare'’ (S. ii. 2. 17, n.). Persius only
says ‘ meum mare ⁵ because he was staying
on the coast, not because he was born
there, as some suppose. (See Life.) ‘Ligus'
is the Greek form. The Scholiast has the
Latin, ‘Ligur.' The bay to which Persius
had retreated for the winter the Romans
called Lunae Portus, It is now well
known as the Gulf of Spezia, and one of
the finest harbours in Europe. It is sur-
rounded by high mountain& and the
valleys run down to the shore, as Persius
describes, and two or three other bays
indented the coast of this buy. Ennius
appears to have visited it near two cen-
turies before Persius wrote, and the line
he quotes is from the Annales of that
writer. The name of the town, if any, at
which Persius was staying is not men-
tioued. It was not Luna (Luni), which,
though it gave its name to the bay, was
separated from it by a range of hills and
the river Macra.
