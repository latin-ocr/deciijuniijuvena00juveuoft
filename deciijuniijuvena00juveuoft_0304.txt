Interdum ille dolor plus quam lex ulla dolori

Concessit.

D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Verberibus, quosdam moechos et mugilis intrat.
Sed tuus Endymion dilectae fiet adulter
Matronae z mox quum dederit Servilia nummos,

Fiet et illius quam non amat3 exuet omnem

Corporis ornatum.

Inguinibus, sive cst haec Oppia sive Catulla?
Deterior totos habet 11118 femina mores.
Sed casto quid forma nocet ’.Ρ-031111 profuit immo

Hippolyto grave propositum? quid Bellerophonti?

deprehensum nervis contudit; Carbo Acci-
811115 3 Vibieno, item Pontius a P. Cernio
deprehensi castrati sunt: Cn. etiam Furium
Brochum quidam deprehendit et familiae
stuprandum objecit. Quibus irae suae in-
dulsisse fraudi non fuit.'’ Socrates touches
on this subject in 1115 discourse with Aris-
tippus (Xen. Mem. ii. 1. 5).

318. Sed tuus Endymion] “But if at
first your fair boy intrigues with a woman
for love, presently when another offers him
money he will be the slave of one whom he
does not love, aud she will strip herself of all
her jewels 3 for there is nothing women will
not give for the gratifying of their lusts,
whether they be high born or low.'’ The
boy's decline is thus traced3 he is chaste
and modest at first 3 his parents sell him to
the lust of men3 when he is old enough he
falls into an intrigue with a married woman
sor love; he is drawn away from her by a
richer woman, and so ends 111 selling his
beauty for money, and from a pure boy
becomes not only a profligate but a greed y
one. Oppia and Catulla seem to be op-
posed as rich and poor, or high and low.
The name of Catulla occurs in S. ii. 49.
Gifford translates v. 318 35 if it were 311
answer of the mother:

“ But my Endymion will more lucky prove,
And serve a beauteous mistress, all for
love.’'

And Accio does the same z

“ Ma il nostro Endimion fia sol di cara
E distinta Matrona amato drudo?

They must therefore have read ‘ mens En-
dymion,' which does not appear in any
MSS. or editions that I 8311 trace.

323. Deterior totos] This verse Hein-
rich considers spurious. As it stands it
seems to mean that the character of the
unchaste woman is all centred in this, that

315
Necat hic ferro, secat illc cruentis
320
Quid enim ulla negaverit udis
325

15 111 the gratification of her lust, or (herc)
111 that which gratifies it. The Scholiasta
appears to mean this when he says “ nihil
aliud nisi libidinem spectat.'' The words
have been turned a great many 113115, aud
Jahn joins ‘ deterior' with Catulla, thus z

sive Catulla
Deterior: totos‚'’ &c.

 

[Ribbeck has the same]

324. Sed casto quidforma nocet ?] He
has just shown that beauty is the first step
to unchastity. But he now adds, “ suppose
he retains his chastity‚ what harm will 1115
beauty do then ?'’ And he answers the
question himself—“nay rather, what good
did Hippolytus' stern resolve do him ?''
He resisted the advauces of 1115 stepmother
Phaedra, who was the daughter of Minos,
king of Crete, and so is called Cressa (v.
327). Bellerophon was tempted by Sthene-
boea, or as some say Antea, and when he
resisted her she charged him to her husband
Proetus, as Potiphar’s wife charged Joseph.
Horace (C. iii. 7. 17) adds a third story of
Peleus flying from Hippolyte (or Astyda-
mia) wife of Acastus under the same 811·-
cumstances ι

“ Narrat paene datum Pelea Tartaro,
Magnessam Hippolyten dum fugit ab·

stinens.''

‘ Propositum ’ 15 used as by Horace, -“ J us-
tum et tenacem propositi virum’' (C. iii.
3). ‘ Haec,’ as is easily seen, though it is
not expressed, refers to Phaedra, who is
called Cressa from her birthplace. She
blushed when she was refused who had no
shame in asking. ‘ Repulso’ is the read-
ing of Jahn and Heinrich, who says it is
the ablative absolute. P. and the Scho-
liast give ‘repulso,' but most MSS. ‘re-
pulsa: which is simplest and best, as a
participle.
