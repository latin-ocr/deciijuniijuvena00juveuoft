360 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

no doubt it was capable of illustration in many ways. There is among oui-solves suffi-
cient distinction between the habits of the army or navy and those of civilians to suggest
plenty of material for good-humoured raillery on either side; and military justice
especially has always been a subject of wonder or amusement to non—military persons,
while some soldiers on their part are seriously of opinion that courts of law are only
made to obstruet justice, and to prevent honest mcn or dishonest from getting their
due. It is to be observed that the author of this piece writes as a civilian, and the
force of the satire turns partly on this.

ARGUMENT.

O Gallus, who can tell the advantages of lucky service Ρ Give me a successful legion
and 1’11 enlist and think my stars have favoured me. Of course a fortunate hour
avails one more than if his wife or mother wrote commending one to Mars.

V. 7. First the advantages that all enjoy. The greatest is that no eivilian dares to
strike you, nay more, if you strike him he holds his tongue and dares not show his
grievance to the praetor. If he would have revenge he has his judge, a stout
centurion in the camp, for soldiers may not go beyond for trial. Most just no doubt
is the centurion’s judginent, and if I’ve right upon my side he'll give me satisfaction.
But all the camp will see that my revenge shall prove a greater trouble than the
wrong. And he’s a bold man who would dare offcnd so many boots and hobnails.
And who would come so far to give his evidence? Let's dry our tears, nor trouble
friends who will not fail to excuse themselves. The man who dares to witness to the
assault is worthy of the olden times: a lying witness may be easier got against a
townsman than a true against a soldier's fortunes and his honour.

V. 35. And if a scoundrel neighbour moves my landmark, or debtor will not give me
back my own, then I must wait and go through all the law's delays, but soldiers are
allowed the time that suits themselves and 110 drag stops their suit.

V. 51. The soldier too may make a will while yet his father lives, for all he gets-
in service is his own. The old man therefore courts his lucky soldier who by fair
favour is rewarded as his gallant deeds deserve. For 'tis the general's interest that

the brave should also be the lucky and pride themselves upon their chains and
collars—
