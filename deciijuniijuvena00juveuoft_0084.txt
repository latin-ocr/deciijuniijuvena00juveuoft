D. JUNH JUVENALIS

Attollens oculos : vitreo bibit 1110 Priapo 95
Reticulumque comis auratum ingentibus implet,

Caerulea indutus scutulata aut galbina rasa,

Et per Junonem domini jurante ministro.

Ille tenet speculum, pathici gestamen Othonis,

Actoris Aurunci spolium, quo se ille videbat

100

Armatum quum jam tolli vexilla juberet.
Res memoranda novis annalibus atque recenti
Historia, speculum civilis sarcina belli.
Nimirum summi ducis est occidere Galbam,

the eyes look larger (H.N. xxxiii. 6). ‘ Tre-
mentes oculos ’ are what Horace calls
‘ putres? “ Omnes in Damalin putres Dc-
ponent oculos,'’ C. i. 36. 17. The phrase is
repeated below (vii. 241). The man raises
his quivering eyes, mimicking a lascivious
woman.

95. vitreo bibit ille Priapo] He driuks
out of a glass made in this obscene shape,
ties up his great bushy hair in a net of gold
thread, wears a blue dress picked out in
square or lozenge pattern, or fine green
cloth with the nap closely clipped. ‘ Gal-
binus ’ is said to be derived from ‘galbus,' a
particular shade of green. According to
this etymology it would naturally be writ-
ten ‘ galbina,’ not ‘ galbana ' (‘gum'), with
which it has no connexion. ‘ Rasa ⁹ is op-
posed to ‘ pexa,' cloth with the nap left on
it. ‘ Scutulatus' is a word of which the
derivation is uncertain ε but ‘ scutulae ' is
used for the squares of a tessellated pave-
ment, or any thing of that sort.

98. Et per Junonem domini] The ge-
nius of a woman was called her J uno (see
note on Hor. Epp. i. 7. 94). This man's
slave, by way of keeping up the farce,
swears by his master's Juno. [Ribbeck
places a full stop after ‘ rasa‚' and has ‘ En
per J unonem domini jurante ministro Ille
tenet speculum ;’ and he omits vv.102, 103.]

99. Ille tenet speculum] The miri-ors of
the ancients were of metal, though there
may have been glass mirrors at this time,
but they were of inferior quality. They
were only made for the hand, and were
usually held by slaves before their mistress
(see Dict. Ant.). This man holds it for
himself, and Juvenal says it was the iden-
tical mirror in which Otho had looked at
himself, and of which this person had rob-
bed him, which is a jest. To make the
absurdity greater, we have a parody of Vir-
gil's words (Aen. iii. 286): “Aere cavo
clipeum magui gestamen Abantis;’' and
again (Aen. xii. 93), Turnus “ validam vi

corripit hastam Actoris Aurunci spolium?
Suetonius says of Otho (c. 12) that he was
of short stature and lame : that he was ef-
feminate in his personal habits, keeping 1115
skin smooth (as meu of the worst passions
did), and that 110 wore a wig which fitted
him so well that nobody would find out it
was a wig. Piso addressing the soldiers
speaks of Otho’s “ vitia quibus solis glori-
atur,'’ and asks, “habitune et incessu an illo
muliebri ornatu mereretur imperium ?” J u-
venal says he carried his mirror into the
camp with him when he went to attack
Vitellius. Tacitus (Hist. i. 88) says that
when 110 was leaving Rome some of 1115

soldiers bought “luxuriosos apparatus con· ,

viviorum et irritamenta libidinum ut instru-
menta belli‚'’ and there may have been a
story current about the emperor-'s mii-ror,
which with his habits he could hardly dis-
pense with. Juvenal says the appearance
of a mirror in the camp was an event to be
recorded in a new page of history.

104. Nimirum summi ducis] Otho having
long been in favour with Nero (i. 39, n.),
deserted him and paid his court to Galba 3
but being disappointed in his expectation
that Galba would make him his heir, with
the support of a small body of troops by
whom he was proclaimed emperor he at-
tacked Galba, who was killed by one of the
soldiers 111 the fray, Λα). 69. According to
Suetonius (c. 12), when Otho himself was
dead most people began to speak well of
him, saying that 110 had killed Galba not
so much for his own advancement as for the
public good. The soldiers wept over him
“ fortissimum virum unicum Imperatorem
praedicantes.'’ ‘Of course,' says Juveua1‚-‘it-.
showed a consummate commander to kill a
tyrant and take such care of 1115 own skin,
and an excellent citizen to aim at stealing
an empire and at the same time to plaster

1115 face with soft bread.' The satire lies in .

the bathos in both cases. Gifford, though
he has not translated the verses well, is
