Praecedit, trahere immo ultro ac vexare paratus.

Vel potius quantum Gradivus Homericus:

beck, has not been guilty of this misuse of
‘ superesse, ’ sor the writer of this Satire is
a declamator. But still Ribbeck adds that
Augustus (Sueton. c. 56) spoke m this way.
lfAugustus used‘ superes. et in place of

‘adesset,’ the w riter of this Satire might do
so.

1110. Mimum aqi! ille,] ‘All the while he
is only acting like the runaway slave in
some mimus of Catullus: referred to on
S. viii. 186, with his plays Phasma and
“ Laureolus. The Scholiast there sav‘s scur-
ra' in this verse is a sl· we (and conversely

‘verna’ is used for‘ scurra? see note ou
ix. 10). Catullus he calls Q. Lutatius.
If that was his name he was Cu-
tulus, which was a cognomen of the
Lutatii. The name of the slave in the
play the Scholiast says was Voranus. He
was a great thief and stole some money
from a bauker, on which there is a joke of
which the point does not appear. Gellius
(xix. 9) quotes some loose verses of Catullus,
which he praises above their merits. Mar·
tial speaks of ‘⁶ facundi scena Catulli '’
(v. 30). Very little is known of him.
‘ Urbani ’ is ‘ witty!

112. ut Stentora vincere possin]
tor was the Greek herald with the mighty
voice in Homer (Il. v. 785) : Στέντορι
χαλκεοφώνῳ ““Ος τόσον αὐδήσασχ’ ὅσον
ἄλλοι πεντήκοντα. But Ares beat him all
to nothing when Diomed wounded him:
ὁ δ’ ἔβραχε χάλκεος Ἀρης, ὅσσον τ’
ἐννεάχιλοι ἐπίαχον ἢ δεκάχιλοι ἀνέρες ἐν
πολέμῳ (Il. v. 859, sq.). ,

113. Audis, Juppiter, haee] See note on
S. ii. 131. ‘ Labra movere ' is opposed to
‘mittere vocem :' the one is a suppressed
cry hardly-audible, the other loud. So
Horace says (Epp. i. 16. 60), “ Labra movet
metuens audiri ;” and Persius (v. 184), ‘⁴ La
bra moves tacitus.'' ‘ N ec ' is ‘ not even!

Sten-

115. Debueras] This is the reading of
some MSS.. and is right. ‘It had been
thy duty to speak out hadst thou been
marble or bronze.’ See note on Hor. C. ii.

“ Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset ;'’

and C. iii. 16. 3: “Tristes excubiae mu-
nierant satis.'' Jahn [and Ribbeck] have
‘debueris’ from P. and other MSS. and
the Scholiast. As to Vagellius, the name
occurs below xvi. 23. Other names appear
in the MSS, Bathylli, and snndry variants
corrupted from it. But they bring us no
nearer to the person intended. The writer
must have had some statue in his mind.
The Scholiast says Vagellius was a great
fool, but like the gods he got a statue.
116. charta pia tura soluta] The paper
in which the grocers wrapped their spices,
and which Grangaeus says was usually co-
vered with the verses of lame poets, was
called ‘ cucullus,’ and from this a hood was
so called. Martial iii. 2: “ Vel thuris pi-
perisque sis cucullus :” and Horace, Epp. ii.
1. 267, sqq.:

‘⁵ Cum scriptore meo capsa porrectus aperta

Deferar in vicum vendentem thus et
odores

Et piper et quicquid chartis amicitur in-
eptis.”

Also Catullus xcv. 9: “ Et laxas scombris
saepe dabunt tunicas ;'' and Persius i. 43:
“nec scombros metuentia carmina nec
thus.'' ‘ Omentum ' is properly the mem-
branc that covers the bowels, and is so
used still. Here it means the entrefis. as

- also in Persius S. ii. 47.
